		R E A L I S T I C  weapons patch

Ever noticed how pathetically unrealistic are the in-game weapons in
Wolfenstein 3D? Well here you have a patch that fixes it all smooth
as it should be - replaced weapons with real WW2 stuff:

Pistol      = Luger "Parabellum"
Chaingun    = "Schmeisser" MP40
Machine gun = Browning M1917 .30 Cal.

			How to install:

First of all, it's for shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D.
You can get it here: ftp://ftp.3drealms.com/share/1wolf14.zip

Unzip VSWAP.WL1 from the package and put it in your WOLF3D folder.
You will be asked to overwrite the old one. Select "Yes".
Run the game and enjoy the feeling or reality brought to you by
the modding community!

	Note:

Yes, you MAY use this patch in with any other TC of yours, if
you credit the whole Wolfer/modding community. It is very
important that you do so, because expect some large changes
in your life otherwise..
