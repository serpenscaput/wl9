					"Meuchelmord" 
					 Version 1.0

Thank you for downloading Meuchelmord! This addon set is intended for users with 
the full version of Wolfenstein 3D ONLY.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Backup the following files in your Wolfenstein directory: maphead.wl6 and gamemaps.wl6.

To do this, simply rename them to something like maphead.alt and gamemaps.alt

2. Unzip the contents of the file "meuchel.zip", the one you downloaded, into the 
Wolfenstein directory. If you are reading this, you most likely did already. 
WARNING: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR ORIGINAL WOLFENSTEIN GAME!!!

3. The files in this .zip file are "readme.txt", "maphead.wl6", and "gamemaps.wl6". 
The two .wl6 files are the important ones.

4. Now run Wolfenstein. The levels in this set replaced the first nine levels in 
Episode One ONLY.

5. When you wish to get rid of the addon levels after you played them, remove the 
two .wl6 files, and rename the files you backed up earlier (see #1) back to the .wl6 
extension.

IMPORTANT!!!
If you have problems with the game after you installed the levels, please contact 
the author of these levels(instructions to do that are at the bottom of this file). 
DO NOT contact Apogee or ID Software!!!!!



These levels were made entirely by a guy by the name of Joey. And that is all you 
need to know. He can be contacted at "FraMauro14 (at) aol.com".
