Description             : My first maps for Spear of Destiny.
			  I recommend to play these maps at skill 4.
			  The second map was inspired by the song "The SS gonna get you" and the 		   
       map has the same name. (you can hear the song at floor04 of SOD)
			  These maps are very hard, so beware.
			  
Instalation		: Before unziping this file into you're Spear of Destiny folder, make 
a 			  copy of the original gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.wl6. When you have done 			 
 that, just unzip this file into the Spear of Destiny folder and play 				  the game. 


Special Thanks to	: Mr.Lowe for testing and editing help. Thanks dude!

on another       room.
