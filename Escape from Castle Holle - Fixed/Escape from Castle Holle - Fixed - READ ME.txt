I started this in November 2005 and it was finally finished in October 2007 with 
testing and a mobo failure pushing the release back to December 2007. 
While the work on this was slow there was little to no work done between August 2006 
and April 2007 as I was working on other projects as well as attending University 
and working full-time.

A lot of time has been spent (as i'm bit of a perfectionist) trying to get everything 
right and in a particular continuous theme.

I would really love some feedback from others on their impressions of the game, especially 
level layouts/difficulties/tricks and traps etc I've used & the overall look and 
feel of the game.
I have created all levels, except levels 13,14,20 and 29, myself from scratch so 
if any seem familiar to any other creators it is purely coincidental.
Level 14 is a level made by me, as a tribute to BJ Rowan, creater of one of my favorite 
mods ever 'Project Totengraeber'. It is made with scenarios copied from different 
levels of the 'Project Totengraeber' mod and conjoined to make one level as a tribute.

Level 20 was made by Tricob, it's a really great challenging level that fits in nicely. 
Thanks for making the level, it was great working with you.
Level 13 & 29 where made by Thomas Weiling. We have worked on many projects together 
and its a great pleasure to have 2 of your fantastic levels in my mod.
Level 26 appeared in Thomas Weiling's now withdrawn 40 level release of 'All this 
& wolf 3d'.
Levels 27 & 28 appeared in the combined 'Community Mappack' made with WLHack, Thomas, 
Brian Lowe, RonWolf and Tricob released on the 27th August 2007.

Anyone can use any of this mod for their own projects, just please credit me or the 
appropriate person for their work.

There a couple of sprites that I can't remember who made them as I ripped them 2 
years ago (I know the urinal is one of them), so If anyone wishes to be given credit 
for anything I've used then please email or PM me and I'll update this text file.


*Warning - The I-L-M cheat still exists but not in a good way!*
The original cheat code has been changed, see if you can work out what it is now....


For more information see the 'Read this' within the game.

Thanks for playing, I hope you find it challenging!
