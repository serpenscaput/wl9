Chrono - Spear of Destiny levels

This is a compilation of 21 new levels for Spear of Destiny (registered version). 
It can be played on every difficulty level, and it's been made to match the environment 
of each of the original levels, so it feels pretty much like playing the real thing.


How to play: 

Simply extract the files on this zip into your spear of destiny folder, overwritting 
the existing files. make sure to make a copy of the original files first, so you 
can put the old maps back later if you want. Else, you can simply make a copy of 
the whole folder and extract the files there :).

Thanks for downloading, enjoy!
