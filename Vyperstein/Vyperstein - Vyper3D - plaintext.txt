From the Vyper one,
	Hello, my name is Scott Vyper. I am the creator of Vyper Productions and all of 
it's great creations. What your checking out now is the shareware version of my first 
official Wolf 3D addon, Vyper 3D. I created this as freeware for all of you to enjoy, 
i just called it the shareware version because it's the first 10 level's i changed. 
I did some source code changes and there is a couple of bugs I have to fix, but all 
around it's a great game. Once I am finished with all 60 Levels, it goes to you as 
freeware as well. All graphics were not created by me and was used from GIF sets 
I downloaded off the internet, so if you copyrighted any pictures that are on my 
game, blame the people that put them on their site, not me. Thank you for downloading 
Vyper 3D and I hope you enjoy.

Game Story
______________________

	You are BJ Blazkowitz, you have finished the destruction of Hitler and the world 
is saved. Or so you thought. You get a call from American Intelligence and learned 
that Nazi activity has picked up. You are already worried that your brother, Vyper 
Blazkowitz, has disappeared.
	You arrive at AIHQ and learn your mission information. You learn that Hitler has 
been resurrected but looks different. You see a picture of the new Hitler and the 
person looks very familiar. You suggest that maybe Hitler wasn't resurrected, maybe 
he took the body of an innocent man and assumed his identity. Your not all wrong 
though because that is exactly what happened.
	On the airplane back to Germany you later realize who the man in the picture is! 
How could this be? You compare the picture of your brother and the picture of the 
new Hitler, and find out it's the same person! Your brother hasn't disappeared, Hitler 
took over his body! Vyper was always the scared one of the family so it had to be 
Hitler taking over his body! The airplane lands during the night time far from the 
Castle. You walk towards the castle and to your suprise. You see a picture of Vyper!

	After fighting all the Nazis you then realize that this is not the castle with Vyper 
in it! But Vyper fled because of a huge mutant experiment gone wrong! After Vyper 
healed Schabbs, they tried to develope another ubermutant from Trans Grosse's body. 
After they turned him, he was out of control and all the other mutants turned on 
them as well. Killing all the nazi's! Some nazi's hid away while Schabbs and Vyper 
fled.
	For the complete Vyper 3D story, wait for the full version release which will include 
the whole story.

Shareware Information
______________________
	There are only 10 levels to the shareware version of Vyper 3D. There will be 60 
when i'm done with the registered version. There is only 2 known bugs! Some of the 
outro text scrolls acress the screen and is unable to be read and I have not yet 
recorded any demo's so when it tries to run a demo, it will crash. In Vyper 3D version 
2.0, those bugs should be fixed. If you have any comments, suggestions, hate mail, 
like mail or any kind of mail that is related to the game or Vyper Productions, e-mail 
me at UCWVyper@aol.com.  Thank you.
