This is a 10 level demo version. The full set should be released later in the year.

These levels are selected levels only from the full 30 level version. They will not 
be in the same order in the full version.

The full version will be 30 consecutive levels with plenty of new features such as;

*Full screen
*25 Ammo box added
*Player speed and hit points changed
*ILM cheat changed
*Deathcams disabled
*Some enemy hitpoints and speeds changed
*Points for extra life changed

The full version will also have some changed graphics and sprites not seen in the 
demo version.

I have been working on Escape from Castle Holle for about 6 months now.

A lot of time has been spent (as i'm bit of a perfectionist) trying to get everything 
right and in a particular theme.

I would really love some feedback from others on their impressions of the game. (Don't 
worry if it's critical, as long as it's constructive!) There is a thread on the die 
hard wolfers forum under the title 'Escape from castle Holle' which you can chat 
about the game on as well as see some screenshots of what's to come in the full version.



Big thanks to Thomas for testing and advice along the way.

Thanks for playing
