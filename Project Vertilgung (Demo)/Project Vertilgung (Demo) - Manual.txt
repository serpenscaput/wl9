VERTILGUNG
================ demo =================
BY: ZACH HIGGINS

Story:
=======================================================================

	Slowly and stealthily Army Ranger Captain B.J. Blaskowicz creeps down the silent 
and empty hall. The walls have the smell of death. He doesn't know if it's just him 
or if someone's watching him. He turns the corner when out of the corner of his eye 
something moves.  CLICK! He turns and pulls the hammer on his P-08 Luger. A rat scurries 
by. Sighing a heavy relieved sigh, he lowers his gun. "Damn these halls!" He mutters. 
He turns around to keep moving when suddenly, "Halte!" screams a gray shirted soldier. 
Quickly he rolls to the cover of a nearby alcove. Cocking his weapon he jumps out, 
aims at the surprised German and fires. The Nazi crumples and blood begins to slowly 
pour out of the man. With much frustration B.J. kicks the dead soldier yelling,"Piece 
of SHIT!" He turns around only to find himself looking down the barrel of a pistol. 
BANG!
	AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! B.J. sits up, looks around and realizes he's in his Army quarters. 
Sweat pouring from his body, he gets up. It's been 6 months since he retrieved the 
Spear of Destiny from the nazis' clutches. He fought the Angel of Death and is still 
recovering from the injuries. Ever since then he's had nightmares about the whole 
ordeal. It always ends the same though. He gets shot through the head. He looks over 
at the clock. 5:00 a.m. Aw shit. He knows he can't go back to sleep though. Out of 
nowhere his cell phone starts ringing. Scrambling around in the dark, he finds it 
sitting on his dresser. He was decorated greatly for his bravery in defeating General 
Fettergheist and capturing the Spear of Destiny. As a result he got some of best 
quarters around. He frantically answers the phone. "Hello?" It was General Eisenhower 
himself. "I need you to report to my office immediately. Understood?" "Yes Sir!" 
B.J. replied.

	"We have reports of a large amassing of German troops and munitions at a remote 
area in South Austria. I hate to tell you this but you'll be returning to Castle 
Wolfenstein". A wave of horrible memories swept through B.J.'s mind. "As far as we 
know there are only standard Wehrmacht and some S.S. There may be some high  ranking 
officers though. You're the best of the best soldier. That's why we're sending you 
in." Before the Wolfenstein ops I was labeled "a terminal action seeker." I'm not 
so sure about that anymore sir." B.J. replied. "Come with me B.J." said the general. 
He led him into a huge room full of people working on maps, weapons, and all sorts 
of things. "This is very confidential B.J! If this info got to the public there would 
be mass panic. You remember Dr. Artz Schabbs?"asked Eisenhower. "I'd rather not, 
but yes sir I do," answered Blascowicz. "Head of the S.S., Goering, has recruited 
him for a very strange task. His task is to find a way to ressurect Hitler. He doesn't 
want him to reincarnate as near mindless zombie like Schabbs' previous creations. 
He also wants him to actually look like he did before he was assassinated. A perilous 
task. If he succeeded it would spell doom for us Allies.  He could create an army 
of soldiers that aren't just brainless robots but planning, thinking killing machines. 
So you're not just being asked to do this you're being ordered. Any questions?" " 
No sir!"

	"Jump time is in less than a minute." reminded the pilot from the cockpit of this 
tiny, inconspicuous plane. "Gotcha," B.J. told him. Strapping on his parachute he 
readied to jump. He was dressed in an all black jumpsuit. Then the pilot yelled,"OK 
go ahead." He leaped from the plane. He knew exactly when to pull his chute. He had 
been a paratrooper before being recriuted for the O.S.S. It was deep in the night 
so he didn't worry about anyone spotting him. What he did worry about was landing 
in a tree or some other obstacle. Then he saw it. A huge, familiar castle loomed 
ahead of him. He landed with a thud. He pulled off his parachute and ran behind a 
tree. He had heard some steps. All they had given him was a knife. He saw a guard 
walking. He was only standard infantry thank God. It would have been tough to take 
on a machine-gun toting S.S. with just a knife. It was obvious he'd heard something. 
When the guard's back was in full view B.J. jumped out, grabbed the guard and pushed 
the knife into his lower back. He gurgled for a moment then lost conciousness and 
slowly slid down. "Still got it!" said B.J. He picked up the guard's pistol. It was 
a P-08 German Luger. He checked the clip. It had 8 rounds. Walking around the installation 
he found a small room behind many vines and a row of white pillars. There were three 
guards standing together talking. Stealthily B.J. slid between the pillars. Here 
we go!


Features:
================================================================

Brand new Status Bar
New title screen and "PC-13" screen
Tons of new graphics many done by me
New, more realistic actors. (The brown-shirted guys, which I'm assuming were supposed 
to be the S.A., had disbanded many years before U.S. involvement in the war. So I 
made them into standard Wehrmacht soldiers with gray shirts. B.J. Rowan made some 
extremely excellent S.S. Before they were blue suited. I figured that it was some 
way of making a cartoonish black. Much thanks goes to B.J. Rowan for the black-suited 
S.S!
Some new wall textures

Note: With the exception of episode 6 these are meant to be played in order.

Episode 1: Infiltrate Wolfenstein
In this episode your mission begins. Upon arrival at Castle Wolfenstein you are to 
work your way to top floor where you will most likely find the maps that will lead 
the Allied Forces to Schabbs and his Ongoing task to ressurect Hitler.

IMPORTANT: Episodes 2 through 6 will not appear in the demo version.

Episode 2: Operation: Ressurection
After retrieving the maps we find that Schabbs plan is working. He has already manufactured 
half an army of super-soldiers. Get in there and take out Schabbs and his creations. 
If you get there in time perhaps you will be able to destroy his Hitler creation 
as well.

Episode 3: Die Mutant Clone Die!
Upon eliminating Schabbs and Hitler Mutant you find some very surprising news. While 
researching a way to ressurect Hitler Schabbs stumbled upon a method for cloning. 
You found that he has created a clone of Hitler in case something like this happened. 
It's location was included in a letter as well. Your mission is to destroy the Hitler 
clone and any evidence that might exist.

Episode 4: Assasinate Goering
Now that the real threats are disposed of you must destroy the head of the operation, 
Herman Goering. You must infiltrate his personal bunker and take him and his body 
guards. This is your toughest mission yet. Good luck!

Episode 5: Assasinate the Heinrich
We have evidence to prove that the Heinrich Himmler is alive and in hiding. Find 
his ass and destroy him. If you take out the head of the S.S. that'd be it for the 
Nazi vision. This is your most important mission yet. Keep your senses active . The 
installation is sure to be packed with elite guards.

Episode 6: Training levels
These are some recreations of the levels you fought bosses in, in the original Wolfenstein 
game. Good for practice.

Weapons:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the weapons found in the game. 


 Combat Knife
Basically this is a last resort. It can be used to spare ammo. Be careful when trying.


    P-08 parrebellum.
This was the German standard pistol in WW2(I know it wasn't in use while the U.S. 
was in the war but I like it better!). This is the weapon you start the game with.


  MP-40
A very reliable weapon, This sub-machinegun was used throughout the war. The deadly 
S.S. utilize it so be careful.

 Chaingun
This is the ultimate in WW2 weaponry. Developed by the Germans it was rarely used 
in combat since it tended to jam frequently.(jk)

  Ammo clip
This ammo fits all the guns. Found nearly everywhere. You just have to look hard 
enough. If you get it off a fallen man you get 4 bullets. If you get it off the ground(unused) 
you get 8 bullets.






Pickups:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the items you will pickup as you progress through the game.

Health Items:


  Dog Food.
Self explanatory. It's dog food. Increases life by 2%. Usually found in kennel areas.


  Chicken Dinner
Last time I ate a a big chicken dinner I felt pretty good. So why shouldn't B.J.? 
Increases health by 10%. Yummy! Found in kitchen areas mostly.

  Med-kit
German first-aid kits. Really good for you! Increases health by 25%.  Found in a 
lot of secret areas.


Treasure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is treasure stolen from people(usually Jews)by the Germans and stored in the 
castles. They go in order from least point worth to greatest point worth.

 Cross
These are found frequently and are not worth very much.

  Chalace
Found pretty often. These cups are pure gold and were once drank from by Austrian 
royalty.

  Treasure Chest
These babies are pretty rare. Good money(and points).
  Candle Stand
Popular table decorations. Solid gold with high quality candles. These jackpots are 
worth a LOT. Very rare. (If you think this is supposed to be a Chanukah candle dealie 
its not. It was going to be but it would be huge and hard to fit. If you're a Jew 
and are offended by me calling it a Chanukah candle deelie don't be. I just can't 
remember what it's called.)
 Life, 1up, whatever you want to call it
This awesome and EXTREMELY rare pick-up gives you 100% health, 1 life, and 25 bullets.
