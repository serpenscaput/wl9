What it is...
--------------

It is a full set of new levels for Blake Stone, Aliens of Gold, the
REGISTERED version.  There are many guards on every floor, a lot of secret
doors with a lot of bullets and food machines (sometimes you're out of
food tokens).  I must admit I always have put in too many bullets, but
it isn't that easy you know to be good for everyone.  Some people always
shoot with the big pistol, others (like me) do also use the smallest
pistol to spare bullets (not very necessary) and to make the game
somewhat exciting (an ion comes flying towards you and you need to
wait until your pistol is charged again).  If you dislike the number
of bullets, you may freely delete some ammo packs.
As people who played Guystein know, I do not like Super Bosses, so here
there are also NO Super Bosses.  I have replaced him (or her) with 
Generator Drones of level 6, floor 9 of the original set.  The secret rooms
are easy to find, but you maybe need to shoot through pillars (if you want
to succeed).  As I told, there are bullets to shoot, take them or you will
be shooted.  Have great fun and please continu to read this text file,
because there is a question in it.

'Guystone.zip' consists of
	* 'Maptemp.bs6'
	* 'Maphead.bs6'
	* 'Guystone.txt' (this file)
To play, simply rename the original 'Maptemp.bs6' and 'Maphead.bs6' to some
other extension and put the files above into your Blake Stone directory.


It's for free, but...
----------------------

Yep, Yep, Yep.  I think this is a first real add-on for Blake Stone.
I have nowhere else found a set of (p.e. 66) floors, so I made them myself.
It takes time to produce them and I've only recently started to editing
games like Wolfenstein 3D and Blake Stone (PS. today it is
already more than recently).  It's very pleasant, you know.  I make people 
happy with the levels, so I continue to do it.  Nowadays I know there are 
still many people who like to play Blake Stone.  Because I like to know
many people, you may always do the following

	
	PLEASE MAIL ME TO SAY YOU ARE SUCH A PERSON WHO STILL PLAYS 
	BLAKE STONE, NEVERTHELESS THERE IS NOWADAYS DUKEM NUKEM, DOOM,
	AND OUR LOVING LARA (TOMB RAIDER).  THE MORE MAILS ARRIVE, THE
	MORE I LIKE IT TO EDIT THE GAME AND THE BETTER THE LEVELS WILL
	BE.


I have some questions...
-------------------------

When creating these floors I encountered some troubles and one of them
is still present in Guystone (these problems aren't big, you know).

* Floor and Ceiling Texture doesn't work properly.  Can someone tell me 
  exactly what to do to make it work? (SOLVED!, The floor and ceiling
  texture remains the same over the whole floor)

* Starting in an elevator seems a little bit strange, but how can I solve 
  this?  I put the start pointer in the right direction, but I always start
  in that corner with the face to the wrong side. (SOLVED!, Just looking
  to the originals)

* A problem when testing some floors (p.e. floor 8 and 9 of level 3) was 
  that a chest and a bed were walkable (or invisible).  I really do not know
  how this could be a problem because on mapedit there was no problem.  So
  the real reson of this bug is never been solved by me, but I have SOLVED it 
  by deleting the problems and putting another guard somewhere else in the 
  battlefield.  So I hope you will have no problems with these invisible
  guards.

* A strange thing on floor 10 of level 1 (if you ever reach this floor, hihi).  

  You will hear in some rooms that some guards awake.  I know these guards
  stand in little rooms (only one floor pixel) near to the room with the
  electric barrier in the middle.  They stand on a non-secret floor, which
  I nowhere else used.  So why they awaken? (BIG QUESTION and NOT SOLVED)

Thanks for reading these questions and if you know some answer, please 
MAIL it to me.  If you encountered still some bugs, turrets who seem to do
no many harm, guards who sleep even when you have tried to awaken them, 
invisible things...



Future work...
--------------

Beside my job and beside all my other amusing things to do, I have some time
to spend on editing games.  Today, I have created two 60 level sets of
Wolfenstein 3D and a 66 level set of Blake Stone.  Tomorrow, there will be
* A full set of Planet Strike (i.e. 24 floors).  They are already finished,
but nowadays they are tested and I guess the release is planned in March
2002.
* A totally new project, kind of Larastone.  Oh yes, I do play Tomb Raider.
Maybe I'm already old fashioned, because nowadays there are much heavier
and innovative games than Tomb Raider, but please I have to do some other
things than gaming.  The only games I play today are Tomb Raider and
Sensible World of Soccer and a little bit apogee.  But something about the
project.  Eidos (the inventors of Lara) released a level editor.  It is
quite complex and time consuming, but the results seems great to me.
Therefore I want to create a Blake Stone environment with Lara walking
around, shooting through pillars, swimming in the dark (this wasn't possible
with Blake), etcetera.  Let's call it Larastone.  So this is a very future
plan.  Very future, because I first need to finish playing the add-ons of
TR1 (unfinished business) and TR2 (golden mask).  This is just because I
find it stupid to start TR4 when you haven't finished the previous ones.
Oh ya, what about TR3.  Well, I'll need to start with it after TR4 (something
I do not like, but ya, the editor is meant for TR4 and the best thing to do
before editing a game is playing it first).  Very big explanation to say
that Larastone is for the moment nothing more nothing less than an idea.
