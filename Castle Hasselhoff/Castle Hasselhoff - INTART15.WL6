^C96 CASTLE HASSELHOFF

^C95 Level 15

^C10 The elevator takes you to the bottom floor. You run outside and elbow a passing 
guard off his bike. "Damn motorbike levels ROCK!" you shout as you once again drive 
off into a path of nazis. "Time to go home." you say as you head off into the path 
of Castle Hasselhoff.
