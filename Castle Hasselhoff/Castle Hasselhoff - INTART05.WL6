^C96 CASTLE HASSELHOFF

^C95 Level 5

^C10 You arrive on the bottom floor of Wolfenstein. You know that to escape you need 
to kill Adolf. "But what about the storyline?" you think, killing Hitler so early 
in the game would kinda ruin it a bit. But then you remember games like 'Hitler Strikes 
Back' where they managed to use Hitler's head on a robot. Well at least you can put 
him through some pain on the way.
