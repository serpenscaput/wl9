Castle Hasselfhoff
by Michael Collin '07

Story;
You David Hasselhoff were given the orders to inflitrate 
Castle Wolfenstein and assasinate Hitler. All was going 
peachy until you were captured along the way. Not only 
this but the nazis have broken into your castle in 
order to play out weird experiments.

Your new mission is to escape from Wolfenstein's dungeons, 
kill Hitler and get back home in time for Dinner.

Yes I know it's not excatly the most epic and exciting storyline ever
but I did this so that the story unfolds during the game.

Bulid Time;
19 Friday January - 19 Monday February

Funny thing about this is that the original Castle Hasselhoff that 
was back in 2005 was lost to the infamous Hard Drive wipe.

So from January this year I decided to remake it and its way better 
than it once was.

Hints;
When you see a key being blocked by something there is usually
a push wall near by.

When using the bike use the Shift Key and back arrow to manoeuvre easily.

You may also experience the sound cutting out. If this happens just press T-A-B to 
fix it.
