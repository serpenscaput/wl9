                                version 1.2.1
                         ---------------------------


        Welcome to 'SUPER WOLFENSTEIN', which should really be called 'fixed 
wolfenstein', the best anyone can get the Wolfenstein shareware to look.  So 
far the badguys aren't any different but various walls, doors and objects have 
changed.  I've taken stuff from the Wolf3D shareware, spear of destiny demo, 
and doom to put together a good lookin thing.  Hope you like it.


Things that have changed:

> New walls from doom and spear of destiny
  - Doors look way better
  - Steel plate walls look way better
  - 7 new walls from the spear demo
  - 1 new wall from doom
  - 1 completely origonal wall
> dog food is no more--now its more like doom
  - Normal food gives 4% life
  - small medpack gives you 10%
  - large medpack gives you 25%
> Fixed objects
  - the clip looks better
  - the oil drum isn't as colorful
  - I've removed the unidentified object off the table
  - machine gun and chain gun look alot better
> the extra man looks real cool(I'm not gonna tell you what it looks like! :P)


        Right now the levels are all the same with different scenery here and 
there (shhh, don't tell anyone but I put a new secret on floor 1!) but 
eventually I'm gonna make new levels to show this upgrade's true power.


Installation Instructions:
