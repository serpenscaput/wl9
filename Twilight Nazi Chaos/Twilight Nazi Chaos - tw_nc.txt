Other levels            : I love a bunch of other games, and I will definately 
			  make levels for them as well. Keep checkin my site from 
			  time to time.

Description             : 5 brand new levels and a new uniform for the SS.
			  Quite a challenge! Use frequent quicksaves and you'll survive!
			  Trust me, it can be beaten without cheats. I've tested it over and over. 
                        
***FRIENDLY REMINDER*** : Be sure to create a backup copy of the following files 

                          before unzipping this neat little package into your SPEAR 
directory:
	                  
			  GAMEMAPS.SOD
			  MAPHEAD.SOD		    
    			  VSWAP.SOD
