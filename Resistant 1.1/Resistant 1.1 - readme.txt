Known Bugs:
==========
-Be VERY careful in level 7 (with the black metal concert) with the things you do. 
The game does crash very often, especially after killing the last 'psycho doctor'...I 
don't know the problem yet (I'm working on it). If you find out what's the reason 
for the game crash, mail it to me on

in-ketten (at) hotmail.com

. Thank you. I am very sorry for every bug in my game you see.



Tip: If you don't want to see the title screen of Resistant, start the game with 
'nowait' as parameter.


Enjoy playing!
