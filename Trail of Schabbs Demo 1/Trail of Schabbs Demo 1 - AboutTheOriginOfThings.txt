The story:

Germans are on the fall, despite all their campaigns to turn the course of war... 

Outcome has nearly allways been disastrous. 

Eventhough the Soviets haven't started their march to Berlin, the outcome 
of war has come clear in minds of many... There ain't any escape for 
nazis any more, they will surely lose the war. 

Events of the last months has been a preloque to this conclusion: 
Assassination of the "genuine Aryan" family Grosses, Rommels defeat 
in El Alamein and many more frightening failures of German battleunits. 

But the most destructive loses has been caused by one man... 
Captain William Blazkowicz who put end to the threat of chemical warfare 
(may Otto Giftmacher and General Fetgesicht burn in peace) and captured 
the Spear of Destiny from the cluthes of Adolf Hitler. 

But once again humans are know to commit desperate acts for their survivalance 
and nazis aren't an exception. 

Somewhere under Rheinstaad, the order of Himmler (nazis of the round table) 
has gathered to make the final solution to seal the glorious victory of the Third 
Reich...

Tools used:

Borland 3.1 C++: Source code editing
Ms-Paint: Graphics/textures/sprites editing
FloEdit: Importing graphics/textures/sprites/sounds/ and editing maps

To those who propably open my VsWap with some editing tool (FloEdit,WDC,ChaosEdit...):


VsWap ain't yet finished, some of the walls and floor/ceil. textures are still missing.

Not all enemies and objects have been added (I changed my consept and start to "build"

new VsWap)... and in the end of the file you might see some enemy sprites, but that 
has
the same reason I already mentioned (its the "rebuilding" of VsWap).
