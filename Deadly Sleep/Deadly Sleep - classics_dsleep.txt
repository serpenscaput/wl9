DEADLY SLEEP -- ECWOLF CLASSICS EDITION

By Arielus and Brian Lowe
Ported to ECWolf by Executor

This is a port of Brian Lowe and Arielus's 2009 Countdown to Disaster TC to ECWolf. 
The source edited exe and self-contained files have been replaced by a small 95KB 
pk3 that contains only the files not in Wolfenstein 3D v1.4. All of the maps are 
presented unchanged. The HUD has been cleaned up so the four keys and weapon display 
are nice and seamless, and the bronze and iron keys have their own indicators. Colored 
keyholes have been added to locked doors to make the four-key layouts easier to navigate. 
No changes have been made to Ragland's graphics and level design, and I have tried 
to match every aspect of it as closely as possible to the original, except some very 
minor graphical cleanup. A Read This! has been included with basic information and 
the original story.

This port should be compatible with any texture, weapon, or gameplay mods made for 
ECWolf that do not have their own maps or alter MAPINFO. Any bug reports should be 
directed to spaceforce-temp (at) hotmail.com.

The original README.txt and STORY.txt are present, unaltered, inside the pk3 file. 
This mod requires Spear of Destiny and will not run correctly under Wolfenstein 3D!
