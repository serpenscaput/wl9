A Spear of Destiny modification
By Arielus & Schabbs



Readme


What you have here is a little Spear of Destiny modification made by Arielus & Schabbs. 
A stand-alone game, it features a small number of code and graphic changes, a different 
storyline, and 16 new levels made over the past few years. In spite of the various 
modifications that were made upon the original Spear of Destiny title, this game 
should be seen, mainly, as a new set of maps. We hope you find it enjoyable.
