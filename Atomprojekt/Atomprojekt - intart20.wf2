^C7eARRESTED!!

As you were attempting to flee Erlangen you were detained by the SS.  They knock 
you unconcious and then transport you to an unknown location.

You wake up, not knowing how many hours have passed or where you are, near death 
and writhing in pain.  All you can do is wait.  Wait to die or for an opportunity 
to escape...
