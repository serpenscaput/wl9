^C00
Still stunned by the inhuman monsters and experiments you have just overcome, you 
manage to steal a truck and escape. You rendezvous with Allied Command and inform 
them of the reason for your delay and the attrocities you had witnessed.

Next, you arrive at Josef Engelke's top-secret laboratory. Infiltrate the facility. 
Disable Engelke's nuclear reactor and assassinate him at all costs. The fate of the 
world depends on you...
