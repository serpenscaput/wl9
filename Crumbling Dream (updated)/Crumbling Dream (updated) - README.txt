* Gameplay-information *

Crumbling Dream is a Wolf3D community project dedicated to a classic retelling of Episode 3 using all the SOD assets to create a more immersive experience, with a few tasteful improvements such as a full-screen experience with a small hud reminiscent of Duke3D and 8 weapons for your shooting pleasure. The aim was to make an experience as close to "vanilla Wolf3D" as possible with 20 well-designed, enjoyable maps made by the community for your gaming pleasure.

Originally initiated in 2001, the Crumbling Dream project never amounted to much. At its peak of interest, a few members were aboard the project, including AReyeP, Leo Bourbeau, Ian Franken, Eric Vaughn, Kenny Riley, Chad, Scott Croneberger, Sam Chiang and Tris. The original game files were later used for Revival of Memories in 2006, a joint effort between Brian Lowe, MCS Amsterdam and Tris. Now, after 23 years, the mod is finally done for you to play. Cool, eh?

Keep on Wolfing!

* Storyline * 
Spring, 1945.

The Nazi war machine, once an unstoppable juggernaut crushing all in its path, now lies crippled. The Allied forces, relentless and resolute, are tearing through the German Fatherland, driving ever closer to Berlin. Victory seems inevitable. Allied High Command, confident that their march through German territory will soon culminate in the fall of Berlin, moves swiftly to finalize plans for the final blow. Urgency has given way to a calm assurance. The days when the Reich held the upper hand are long gone. The Allies can almost taste victory. But in war, assumptions can be deadly. Could they be wrong?

You are William Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz, the embodiment of the Allied war effort's daring and heroism. Your exploits have become the stuff of legend. Capturing the "Spear of Destiny" itself, denying Hitler a powerful psychological weapon when the Reich was at its zenith. You escaped from Castle Wolfenstein, leaving behind a trail of shattered Nazi ambitions, including the death of the madman Dr. Schabbs. Your efforts had struck at the very heart of the Reich’s evil. But now, as the war nears its conclusion, you notice something troubling. A complacency, a sense of victory already won, has crept into the Allied command. You’ve never been one to let your guard down. And so, you’ve requested a meeting with the man now running the show, General Henry Jackson, Commander in Chief of Allied Forces, stationed in a heavily fortified bunker near liberated Paris.

As you enter the General’s office, your instincts are sharp, your mind alert. You snap to attention and salute. The General, a cigar hanging from the corner of his mouth, eyes you thoughtfully. “Ahh, B.J. Blazkowicz,” the General says, his voice smooth but heavy with authority. He gestures to a seat across from him. “Take a load off, son.” You sit, though your thoughts are racing. General Jackson leans back in his chair, puffing away, before fixing you with a questioning look. “What’s on your mind, B.J.?”

“General,” you reply, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this. I know we’re close to the end, but we can’t afford to let up now. Overconfidence could be our downfall. We need to keep the pressure on, every step of the way.” Jackson smiles, but there’s something beneath it—impatience, or perhaps something darker. “I appreciate your concern, B.J.,” he says slowly, “but trust me, everything is under control.” You lean forward. “With all due respect, General, you’ve only been in command for a month. It’s not like you’ve led this invasion from the start.”

Jackson’s smile falters, his eyes narrowing. “I’ve been in this chair since General Ridley’s unfortunate demise, Blazkowicz. Poisoned, they said. Since then, the command has been more vigilant than ever.” “Good to hear,” you reply, though your suspicions only deepen. “Still, I’ve had experience behind enemy lines. Maybe I should infiltrate Berlin, get a sense of what kind of resistance we’re up against.”

That seemed to set him off. The General’s eyes flare with sudden anger. “Do you think we’re blind, B.J.? We know what the enemy’s up to better than they do themselves, soldier. You sneaking into Berlin isn’t going to change a damn thing. You’ve done enough. Now I’m giving you an order —stay out of this. Victory is ours. It’s only a matter of time.”

You snap to attention and salute, but as you turn to leave, something gnaws at your gut. Something’s wrong here.

As the door closes behind you, Jackson stubs out his cigar, muttering under his breath. “Blazkowicz... If only getting rid of you were as easy as poisoning Ridley was.” Turning to the table beside him, Jackson gazes at the meticulous plans laid out before him. The plans he’s been working on ever since he assumed command. 

The Führer would be pleased. The Allied forces were walking straight into the trap—an ambush meticulously crafted by none other than Heinrich Jäger, Nazi loyalist, and better known to the Allies as General Henry Lee Jackson. Years of playing the role of the faithful Allied commander had been grueling, but now, the fruits of his labor were at hand. The Reich would rise from its ashes once more, honoring the fallen of 9th November 1923. The wreaths would read "and yet you have conquered". Yes.

“Yes, Blazkowicz,” he whispered, his voice tinged with malice, “victory will be ours. Not yours. Ours. Heil Hitler.”

But he had made one fatal error; he let you leave. Your instincts, sharpened by years of combat, told you something is terribly wrong. Damn his orders. If General Jackson wouldn’t see reason, you would. It was time for B.J. to pay Berlin another visit— and this time, make sure Hitler himself didn’t have any surprises waiting for the Allied armies.

---

**Two days later: Berlin, Hitler’s bunker**

The message from “General Jackson” had finally arrived. In response, German forces moved swiftly into position, encircling the Reichstag, awaiting the unsuspecting Allied armies. The trap was set, the ambush meticulously prepared. It would be a massacre for the unsuspecting Allied forces.

The last thing the Germans needed was B.J. Blazkowicz showing up.....................
