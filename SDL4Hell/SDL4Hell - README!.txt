First of all thanks for downloading my Wolfenstein 3D maps SDL demo!

This demo contains 1 episode of 10 levels all made by me. When I release the 
full version of my Wolfenstein 3D maps it will contain 60 levels of course.

Note: this Add-on requires the original Wolfenstein 3D files.

How to play/install:

1. Unzip this file
2. Copy/paste the following files from your Wolfenstein 3D folder into this 
   folder:

   -AUDIOHEAD
   -AUDIOT
   -VGADICT
   -VGAGRAPH
   -VGAHEAD
   -VSWAP

3. Run SDL4Hell
4. Recommended difficulty: "Can I play daddy?"
   "I am death incarnate!" Is only for the DiehardWolfers!

All levels have been tested on all difficulties and are completable. You are 
able to get 100% on all levels, except level 1, which I'll explain.

The levels

My levels differ from the ones in the original Wolfenstein 3D (Duh), but I
did only use the wall textures that we're used in the original episode 1.
I'll give information about some of the more special maps I made in this demo:

-Level 1: "Prison Guardian"-
I decided to start your Wolfenstein adventure different than the original 
Wolf3D. So instead of your average prison and weak guards, you now get to 
know how it feels to be hunted. As soon as you open the door of your cell,
you get greeted by the Ubersoldat known as Hans Grosse! 

So how do you kill Hans Grosse on the first level of the game? You don't!
Instead, you have to run for your life. You need to find the exit as soon
as possible, or else Hans will find you, and without ammo, you're toast.

As soon as you're in the elevator, Hans will stop searching for you
and is gonna rest at the final floor of Castle Wolfenstein.

You could also choose to take it easy, and search for the secret level! Enter
"Muken 100" at your own risk, since it is the hardest level of this episode,
and might stay the hardest when the full 6 episodes are released! 



-Level 10: "Muken 100"-
So you think you're manly enough for the toughest prison floor in Castle 
Wolfenstein? You may think you're ready, but your hopes will get crushed
soon enough!

Muken (Meaning "Voided Space") 100 is the most cruel place you will ever see
in vanilla Wolfenstein! This level contains so many dead bodies that it 
outnumbers the guards on this floor! If you have been send to Muken, you just
wish your life will end quickly. Sadly, this isn't the case. Everyone in Muken
will be tortured first, and given dog food instead of regular food, or no food
at all. Not one prisoner send to Muken has escaped from that hell. No one
even survived Muken before!

On Muken, there are exactly 100 guards (Hence the name "Muken 100"), and
no ordinary guards, they're all SS! The SS on this level are no ordinary SS
either, some say they life from the rotten corpses in Muken! 

Hearing all this, do you still think you got what it takes to complete 
floor 10? Will you, Bj Blazkowicz, be the first one to survive Muken and 
defeat the Muken 100? Or will you die like all the others...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenger levels

At the other episodes, I put in some of the levels in episode one, only with
a ton of more guards, and every level has a Hans Grosse in them! Ain't that
great? These levels aren't made to be completed, except on maybe "Can I 
play daddy?" 

Episode 2, Challenger level 1

In the first level, you had to escape Hans Grosse, so how about 5 Hans Grosse
at once? GL escaping them!

Episode 3, Challenger level 5

Just a ton of more guys, and of course the infamous Hans Grosse.

Episode 4, Challenger level 8

When you make noise in the keyroom, there's another room added with some
guards in it. Also, the existing guards that come after you have been 
tripled! + another Hans Grosse.

Episode 5, Challenger level 9

You'll meet a few more guards in the inner sanctum, if you we're not
satisfied with the original Hans Grosse battle :D

Episode 6, Challenger level 10: Muken 200

200? Yes, 200. The amount of SS has been doubled, and one of them has been
replaced with Hans Grosse! This level is practically impossible. Good luck.

Thanks again for downloading! I hope to release the full 6 episodes atleast

wants!

Take care
