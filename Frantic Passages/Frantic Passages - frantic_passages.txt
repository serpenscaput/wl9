Thanks for downloading FRANTIC PASSAGES, my 21st mod and my first mod in 3 (!!!) years.

The mapping for this project commenced in late 2016, and was finished nearly two years after, in December 2018.
I was goofing around with graphics shortly before commencing mapping. These graphics have been put to use here.
Over two years I managed to put together 17 maps. Ten years ago I could put 17 maps together in a week. Not of the best quality, though.
The mod has no plot as such, but you will fight 3 (!!!) bosses on the last level and encounter a few in the other levels.

Thanks a million to AlumiuN who was kind enough to do the coding, and to doomjedi for helping out with a few graphics.

Anyway... Hope you enjoy playing this mod. If there should be any questions, feel free to send me an e-mail at thomas_weiling@hotmail.com.

Thanks for playing!
