Escapism: SDL Version

This 10 level shareware set was made by Thomas. 


Running in DOS hints:

The Dos exe has been included too but if this is used then delete the supplied config.wl1 
file before playing. 

Also, saved games made with the Dos version are not compatible with those made with 
SDL.
