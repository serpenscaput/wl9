ATTENTION:  ENITE3FX.ZIP

WELCOME TO THE SPECIAL INTERNET SCREWUP EDITION OF ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III.
File:  ENITE3FX.ZIP  (Enigma's Nightmare 3 FIX).... Contains known good
copies of the ENITE3F1.ZIP and ENITE3F2.ZIP archives to counteract the bad
copies found at various ftp sites on the internet.


HERE'S THE PROBLEM, FOLKS:  I have been informed that some jerk knowingly
uploaded defective copies of ENITE3F1.ZIP & ENITE3F2.ZIP to various sites
on the internet.  Allow me to thank him personally:

HEY, RUBE, can't you read?  I asked (in the NM-III docs) that defective
archives NOT be distributed.  Let me put it in little words for you... 
"You-not-do-this-thing.  It-bad!"  Get it?

The flaw was in one of the loader FLI files.  This is unacceptable, since
much attention was given to the loader and knowingly uploading a damaged
archive is unfair to other net users.  There are many known good copies
floating around the BBS world.  Surely this person could have taken the
time to acquire a good copy before sending the software to an international
net?  

In the text file describing the ENITE archives he sent to various ftp sites,
the uploader asked for a fix to Enigma's Nightmare I level 5.  Once again,
it appears he can't read.......

AS STATED IN THE NM-III DOCS.... NIGHTMARE III contains all maps for all
previous versions of the Nightmare series, and since all maps in ENM-III have
been fixed already, such a fix is NOT NEEDED. 

IN FACT, users are urged to dump all versions of Nightmare and Nightmare-II
(as well as any known defective copies of EN-III) and use this special
Internet Screwup version of ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III exclusively.  Everything
you need to play all versions of NM are included in ALL versions of the
ENM-III archives, and this file is no exception.

Anyway, back to our uploading friend...........

He then goes on to ask for the X-rated Enigma graphics, ENITE-X.ZIP.  Yup,
he sure wants favors from others right enough...

Yet this same guy knowingly uploaded a damaged copy of Enigma's Nightmare
III to the following Internet ftp sites:

ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca

ftp.uwp.edu

And Lord knows how many others...........

So here's a flash for him: The Enigma X-rated graphics WILL NOT be released
until this fixed version of ENM3 is uploaded to every site you sent the
defective copy to.  I ask all users who find ftp sites which carry
the damaged version (so stated in the text file which the uploader included
with the archives) to upload this known-good INTERNET SCREWUP release.

PLEASE, use the file ENITE3FX.TXT in the main archive as your internet
descriptive text file when you upload the ENITE3FX.ZIP archive to an ftp
site. 

If you you wish to upload Enigma's Nightmare III to a BBS system, simply
extract the 2 ZIP files inside the ENITE3FX archive and upload them, instead
of the ENITE3FX.ZIP file itself (the ENITE3FX.ZIP archive is for internet use
only).

TO ALL USERS WHO HELP OUT BY UPLOADING KNOWN GOOD COPIES OF ENM-III TO FTP
SITES AND BBS:  Thank you!  May the sun shine upon you for all your days!

TO THOSE WHO INSIST UPON DISTRIBUTING DEFECTIVE COPIES:  May you get
grasshoppers in your milk.

Regards, 

ENIGMA-13
