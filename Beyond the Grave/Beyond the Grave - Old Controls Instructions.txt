BEYOND THE GRAVE WITH THE OLD CONTROLS SETUP 

In this version, the Y axis for the mouse is left intact and there is no autorun 
(press 'shift' to run). 

If you want to just use the arrows to move around, like in classic Wolfenstein 3d,

change the 'W' and 'S' in the controls menu to 'up' and 'down' arrows.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 

-make absolute sure you delete the config file first or else the controls will be 
messed up.  

-replace your current GRAVE.exe with GRAVE.exe contained in this folder
