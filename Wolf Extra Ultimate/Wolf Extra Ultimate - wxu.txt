Wolf-Extra Ultimate was originally meant to be a full 21 level set. Unfortunately I do not have the time for that.
I have made one very special level which I think is as good as my very best ones! :-)
Be prepared for surprises and new special features!

The "Death Incarnate" difficulty level is designed to be as difficult as possible without being impossible!

Wolf-Extra Ultimate has been tested and won on "Death Incarnate" in a little less than 40 minutes (par time) with total ratios of 100% in all three categories.
Finishing the game without 100% ratios will make it less difficult to beat the par time.

Remember to leave saved games in different slots so that you may go back to different stages of the game if you need to.

The zip includes the Chaos Edit definition files for Wolf-Extra Ultimate, and a walk-through txt file with accompanying maps. WARNING SPOILERS!
