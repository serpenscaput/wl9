		%%% SHAREWARE %%%

	These levels are ShareWare! You are free to play
	around with them, but if you decide to keep them
	after 15 days, you need to register!

	REGISTERING not only legitimizes these levels for
	you, but you also get another 20 levels sent to you!
	These levels require v1.1 or later of Wolfenstein,
	so don't bother ordering them if you have not already
	paid your money for the legitimate copy of Wolfenstein!

	These 20 new levels use all the new features, creatures,
	and so forth found in the later scenarios of Wolfenstein
	for many additional hours of play value.


	The registration fee is $15, and can be sent to:

		ATTN: LEVELS
		Ideas From the Deep
		P.O.Box 1025
		Campbell, CA  95009-1025

	THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR REGISTERING YOUR LEVELS!
