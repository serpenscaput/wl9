WOLFMASTER NOTE: Yes, some of these levels are duplicated in the other
games available in WOLFMASTER, BUT MANY ARE NOT!  To keep from delaying
the release of WOLFMASTER, I skipped sorting thru it all and getting rid
of the duplicate levels.  Many of the duplicate levels have been
expertly edited by Warren Buss in this package and are now better and
without errors.  These games are certainly the best documented of the
bunch.

60 Floors for the Game Wolfenstein 3-D

Yes, "Guten Tag!" to all you Wolf fans. The 2 word salutation that
strikes fear in all our hearts (or it did the first few times we
heard it). Welcome to 60 custom designed floors for your favorite
3D game. You will hear "Guten Tag!" soon enough!

No, these are not all new floors. Some are. Many have unknown
designers. None are by designers who specifically requested that
their work be excluded from any other body of work. (If any of them
read this and want to give me a release to use their work, I'll be
happy to include them in another 60 floor episode). Where the
designer's names are known, they are listed below in the credits
section and on each floor map.

Many floors (from unknown designers) have had a face-lift. Many of
the floors that've had no changes may be new to you. If not, take
a fresh look at them anyway using no maps or the "mini" maps
described below. If you've played any of these before, you have no
excuse for not playing them at the "Death Incarnate" skill level.

The primary reason then for this package? To bring you a few new
floors, some redesigned ones, and perhaps some of your favorite
floors in 1 convenient package.

A major portion of the credit (apart from the designers listed at
the end) must go to two excellent programs: Mapedit Version 7.0 as
modified by David Huntoon, Bryan Baker, and Matt Gruson, an
original program by Bill Kirby. Also the program WolfMap by David
Lummis. Without these fine programs, these 6 episodes would still
be available, but only in their former states as mostly single
episodes or individual floors.

Game Requirements

These floors were all tested using Version 1.4. These floors do not
work without errors occurring in Version 1.1.  As soon as tests can
be completed with Vers. 1.1, an update will be released. Nothing is
known of Version 1.2 yet.  The first person who reports errors that
cause the game to abort in Version 1.2 will receive a free update to
Version 1.4 from me providing you supply me a copy of Version 1.2 in
exchange. No attempt will be made to make these floors work in Version
1.0.

Every floor was tested at the Death Incarnate level to make sure
everybody was there and every room was enterable. (Don't ask how
many times I died getting this thing ready). I seldom used "God
Mode" unless I needed to get to a remote section of a floor in a
hurry to check some change or other. Hard to see through the red
haze.

  ****IMPORTANT NOTICE****            ****IMPORTANT NOTICE****

If you have problems of any sort using these 60 floors, DO NOT CALL
or in any other way contact APOGEE SOFTWARE. They will not help.
They may not even be polite. <g> Best not to bother them. Try to
reach me through Compuserve or Prodigy.

What to Expect When Playing

The difficulty of play runs the gamut from relatively easy to very
hard. Don't expect the hard ones to be in the later episodes.

First Rule of Play: there are no rules. For example, in the
official version of Wolf3D, you'd never find an enemy guard in a
hidden room. The designers of these custom floors had no such
qualms. Always be on your guard!

Next, the official game never used "tricks" to fool or surprise
you. They were sometimes devious, but never tricky. Well, you can
expect some tricks when playing these episodes. However not on
every floor. On those floors that employ a trick of some kind, the
map for that floor will have an (X) printed beside the title line.

You will not meet Dr. Schabbs or Hitler. No one chose to use them
in any of these designs. But you will definitely see "Arnold" a
great deal more often than in the official game. "Arnold" seems to
be a great favorite of designers and he gets used quite a bit
outside of the Boss level, particularly in the first episode.

About the only thing predictable with these designs is that you'll
meet the "enemy" in many unpredictable ways.

Finally, you will not see any graphic modifications. Sorry folks!
I leave the gory stuff to others.

Floor Hints

This section provides some hints about a few selected floors, so if
you want to skip them for now, put this manual aside and get
started. But please check the credits at the end.

First, a note about hidden doors. If a hidden door won't move as
far as you think it ought to have moved, try again. Unlike the
official version of Wolf, hidden doors in these episodes can be
moved more than once when necessary. If it doesn't move more than
once, it wasn't intended to. Of course, this is a trade-off. For
those floors which require assurance that all hidden doors will
ultimately move as far as they're required, there'll be no Secret
Room bonus.

Episode 1, Floor 3: "You'll have to expect the unexpected on this
floor. For example, if you enter a seemingly empty room, don't be
surprised to see guards suddenly start coming out of the walls
(literally!)". Quote from the designer.

Episode 1, Floor 5: This is the 3rd time a "trick" is used. The
title of this floor is "The Invisible Exit Door". You may or may
not hear the door opening, but just remember what it takes to keep
a door from closing. If the door doesn't remain open, just seek
other egress. If you get trapped inside the room, restart the floor
(or push the up button for the elevator).

Episode 1, Floor 7: The first of several floors featuring "Arnold".
He triples up on the Boss floor. 

Episode 2, Floor 1: Another trick. Invoking Rule #1 again, things
aren't always what they seem.

Episode 2, Floor 5: You won't get a bonus for killing everyone on
this floor.

Episode 2, Floor 7: The first maze. If you're sharp, you'll look
for visual clues to help you through this. If you're really sharp,
you'll find  a way to avoid most of it.  The official version of
Wolf has a floor that is similar to this one. Unlike their floor,
you can actually get through this one - you better, or you won't
find the exit.

Episode 2, Boss Floor: I call this the "Triple Threat". You can
make a choice between Arnold, Otto, or the General. If you feel
lucky you can go for two out of three. Or make a triple play!!
Which you'll have to do if you want all the treasure. (And this
floor was originally so serene).

Episode 2, Secret Floor: Never sure what may happen when you go out
on this floor. I think it's hexed. Sometimes all h--- breaks loose.
Other times there're only a few hard cases, at first. Then...,
well, you'll see. You may discover some interesting features while
you're here. What are those bright, red flashes? My goodness,
they're shooting at moi? You may also get a chance to study your
enemy up close and personal. Nothing overly tough about this floor,
except possibly getting out alive!

Episode 3, Floor 1: This is the first floor included by designer
Randall Penn. The "mini" map contains one hint. It should be easy
to see. It'd be perilous to ignore it. I named this "Indigestion
City".

Episode 3, Floor 8: You may need the ammo you found in the hidden
room to complete this one if you play at skill levels 3 or 4.

Episode 3, Floor 9: One of the best custom Boss levels I've seen.
It has much to try for (as seen on both maps). Good idea to save
before you use your hard earned Gold key, in case you want to
change your mind about leaving before you've found everything.
There's also a bit of a "trick" near the beginning.

Episode 4, Floor 8: You'll hear all the "Guten Tags" you ever
wanted to hear. Best to avoid them! You'll see the results of their
temper in the next room.

Episode 4, Floor 9: Brother and Sister act here. Tough level by
*The Maverick*.

Episode 4, Secret Floor: Almost impossible at skill level 4.
Everyone wears a blue uniform. You may want to opt for an early
exit and get your 15 thou. Ammo isn't exactly plentiful, so
conservation is important. But give it a try. You'll be going in
and out of the maze several times to complete this one. No visual
clues here, but there're 5 "Arnolds" waiting in the maze to assist
you! They're an unruly lot, so try to avoid asking them directions.

Episode 5, Floor 1: Randall Penn's second entry here. It is titled
"Welcome to Hell". Aptly named. Just to get you started, don't wait
around in the elevator or the room outside, or you'll soon have a
visitor who'll wake up almost the entire floor. You'll want a
head-start before that happens. Instead, head out, go to your right
and pick up a machine gun. Turn around and head up the hall (north)
and take care of the guy who's coming to see you. Then head quickly
east and either take a door on your right or go to the end of the
hall and await developments. This is a fun floor at the Death
Incarnate level. There ought to be a prize for the first person who
can finish it at skill level 4 without having to save the game.

Episode 5, Secret Floor: Large floor, huh?

All Floors in Episode 6 are by designer Keith Heitmann. Some of you
may not have seen these floors before. They are very good and are
presented here unmodified. By the way, don't bother looking for an
elevator to the secret floor. While there are 10 floors (and you'll
play them all), the 10th floor isn't the secret floor.
