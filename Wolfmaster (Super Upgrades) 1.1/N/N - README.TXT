I don't know where it came from, it had no docs and a lame BBS
description, but this is the best wolf file I have ever seen!

I know it's small, but it contains 10 more levels of Wolf3d,
much like the first (shareware) episode but harder and with new and
totally different levels.  I enjoy it more than the first version.

Enjoy the profuse carnage!
