             "WOLFMASTER - So you're Death Incarnate huh?"
                           by Carlton Griffin

Well, I believe it's finally finished.  Here are ten levels I have
created myself, from scratch.  I hope you enjoy them.

These levels are hard, but not unenjoyable so.  Play on the hardest
level (I am Death Incarnate) for the most fun.  I didn't put a lot of
effort into making the game challenging if you play at any other level,
but if you're just a total wimp, you should still enjoy yourself.

Most of the secrets in these levels are clearly marked, you can hardly
miss them.  Others aren't marked at all, but they are in an area most
people would check, just because of where they are.  I hate scrubbing
walls looking for stupid little secrets, so don't bother doing it in
these levels.  Save your game just before you enter the elevator, and if
you didn't find all the secrets (and you feel you must), you can reload
the game and go back and look.

These map files won't work with the shareware version of WOLF.
WOLFMASTER is freeware.  It is intended to be used only by registered 
owners of Wolfenstein 3-D. 
This software may not be sold for profit, nor does it carry any endorsement

I assume no responsibility for WOLFMASTER nor its distribution. 
 
If you separate these levels from the WOLFMASTER menu program they are
distributed with, please keep this README file with the maps.

If you really like these levels, please let me know.  Perhaps I'll work
on some more if I think people are enjoying them (It's a lot of work and
consumes a lot of time).
