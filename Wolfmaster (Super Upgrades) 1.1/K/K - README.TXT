    Description:

    Shankenstein is a collection of 6 new episodes, a total of 60 new
    floors, for use by registered owners of Wolfenstein 3D (TM).  These
    levels are NOT provided by Apogee Software Productions and carry no
    warranty.  These levels have been "playtested" by an experienced
    Wolfer using the most difficult level of play.


    About CARDWARE:

    Recently, I became aware of the CARDWARE concept from a game I down-
    loaded from my regular BBS.  Here's the deal:  If you enjoyed these
    new levels (even just a little) I would appreciate it if you would
    send a postcard (a local scene would be nice) to the address below.
    Please mention how you obtained SHANKENSTEIN, any comments and if
    you would have any desire for even more new levels.  It will be
    interesting to see just how far and wide a BBS file travels.
