Look for future updates for WOLFMASTER!

Updates for WOLFMASTER will be out soon!  Just the dozen or so people
who already know about WOLFMASTER have offered many maps.  If I waited
until I collected, checked out, and added all these new maps to
WOLFMASTER it might not ever get released!  :>  Therefore I am going to
release what I have now, with updates comming soon.  Also keep in mind
that many people who find this program might also contact me with new maps.
Keep your eyes open for update announcements.

Updates for WOLFMASTER will be much smaller than WOLFMASTER, and will include
the new map files, and a small INSTALL batch file.

The batch file will update your ALLGAMES.MAP file with the new games, and
will update your menus in BATMENU to make them available.

Look for updates where you got your copy of WOLFMASTER, as well as update
announcements on Compuserve, RIME, FIDO, ect.

Updates will only be possible if I find new maps.  If you have maps that
aren't included in WOLFMASTER, please contact me.  As always, everyone
contributing to WOLFMASTER will receive full credit.
