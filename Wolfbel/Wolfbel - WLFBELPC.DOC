WLFbelPC.ZIP - by Brian E. Lowe
Alternative levels for the full 60 level set of Wolfenstein 3D
(PC version)

Firstly, my thanks to all those who contributed to the original Wolf3D, and its  
map editor. 

WLFbelPC.ZIP contains 2 files GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6.   These 2 files need 
to be unpacked.
 
Unpack the files with PKUNZIP.  Then open up the original 60 level game Wolf3D folder. 
 Rename the original GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6 to something else (say, GAMEMAPS.ALT 
etc).  Then drag the GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6 from the unpacked WOLFbel.ZIP into 
the files in the original  Wolf3D folder.  The unpacked VSWAP file is not required 
for PC users as it's the same as the original. 

Users may freely distribute these 2 files (or the ZIP file), plus this text file 
WLFbelPC.doc, on a non-profit basis.  However, please do not distribute them (or 
the ZIP file), with any other files.  Users must have the original Wolf3D 60 level 
set to play this set.

This 60 level set has 37 new levels.  Many others have been substantially changed. 
 The secret levels (apart from a new one in Episode 6), and the boss levels, haven't 
been changed much.  However, every level has been changed in some way.

GAME STRATEGY
These levels should be played with the original VSWAP file.  I didn't alter any of 
the objects/walls etc.  I find one of the reasons that the game is so compelling 
is the atmosphere of the Nazi era.  (Now that it's gone, that is.  It obviously wasn't 
very nice at the time). 
There aren't many mazes.  Also, all new secret doors are obvious.  (eg, a Hitler 
portrait, or a space between 2 plants etc).  I find endlessly clicking on walls boring. 
 Some secret doors from the original levels will still be there though.
Overall, there are far more guards than in the original levels.  There are more deaf 
guards too.
Every level has a chapel of some kind.  (Sorry, I'm a religion freak).
