Welcome to Astrostein 3. Your adventures in outer space come to their end. After dodging a German penal colony, wrecking their high security spaceship and rampaging through their Moon base, you arrive back to planet Earth, casually dropping on New Berlin like nobody's business. Well, maybe you should have been more careful, because the area ahead is swarming with tough enemies out for your blood. Tear through them, infiltrate the rather heavily populated headquarters and you'll find out that your old pal Hitler is still alive, although in a heavily augmented body. Dispatch him once and for all and the evil empire shall fall, because apparently the Space Reich can't come up with a single competent replacement.

All credits, as usual, go to Laz Rojas, mastermind behind the Astrostein series.

One of the sounds (laser rifle shot) refused my attempts to conver it to a usable format, God only knows why. I used the respective Astrostein 2 clip, which sounds the same, I think. Sorry.
