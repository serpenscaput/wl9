Today's single release is Copland, a six-level Second Encounter set by Munj. A pure mapset, the levels included nonetheless feature some rather diverse mapping. Although map 2 is just a huge maze and map 3 contains arguably too many small square rooms, you will otherwise encounter some interesting room designs (including more than one route to the exit) and, as usual, lots and lots of enemies to dispose of. Get to it.

And remember, cops are your friends.
