What we have here is Kamen Riderstein. There's not much in terms of documentation, so I'm not sure what exactly is going on, but presumably you're supposed to stop some organization from the series (Shocker? no clue, never seen it), encountering miracles like Kaizo Giftmacher or Schabbs-Sensei along the way. It's eight maps for the Third Encounter, plenty of new graphics and *excellent* sound effects, especially spoken greetings. You're going to have fun. Maybe.
