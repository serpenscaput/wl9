Castle ClaustrophobiaTovarich Pizor ?  (1 level for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis level is designed for use with the 1st Encounter, and was presumably made by Tovarich Pizor. Or maybe he just submitted it to an old Wolfenstein website, because that's where I found his name related to this scenario.Tovarich (or Rich) Pizor was an active Wolfenstein fan until a couple of years ago, and he used to have a webpage for Wolfenstein, too. He is probably the author of this Castle Claustrophobia series. He seems to have participated in the activities of WolfAddict software, too.If you know anything about this author or of any other scenario of his, please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpCopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
