Deathmatch RevisitedThis is my first scenario, only updated. In Deathmatch, I forced you to have a chaingun in the first level. I've decided that it must be more of a challenge. I didn't think it was worthwhile to include a readme with it.Even though this is harder, you can complete it in an hour. It is 30 levels long. One is a bonus. Every three is a boss level; or a ton of enemies. I don't know, but this scenario was probably badly made. Don't worry about it; I will work on it. Now let's talk about a few levels:1-x, 2-x: Enter!1-2: A problem at the end, but plenty of escape routes.2-2: When you get the blue key, beware of a guard running loose.3-x: Schabb's Labratory.3-1, 3-2: Only mutants, use the flame thrower. They will hurt you.3-3: Run! Fight two Ubermutants.4-1: Beware of ghosts.5-x: Doggie Kennel: I hate these levels! Those dogs hurt!7-1: This level's fun.7-2: Fun also.7-3: Fight 4 Dr. Schabbs.8-1: I like this.8-2: Don't underestimate the mutants at the end.8-3: This can be hard. Fight 6 bosses at once: 2 Schabbs, 2 Hans Grosse, Tran Grosse, and a Ubermutant.9-x: Security! Lots of people. These are fun!! This section has 5 levels: 9-3: boss, 9-5: Hitler. 9-3: Fight 2 Death Knights. Not hard.9-4: My pride and joy. Fun. You are out of the underground section and on the two ground levels. Easy. Desperate Nazis. Two exits, one will teach you to save your game, and sends you to 1-1.9-5: Easy. In the room filled with crowns, look to the right: the secret has your ammo. Look to your left. Push that secret, go in the door, and you are at Hitler's little shrine. Go down the hall and open the door: 15 Hitlers! Lure them down the hall so they can't turn back, then fire away! Whichever you kill will be the real Hitler, and you will win. That's all.Graphics CreditsThe table with chairs came from Castle Wolfenstein 5.0 by Josh Mills.The cage w/ skeleton came from the same place; I edited out the blood.Have fun!Miguel Faria	scooter_31210@yahoo.com
