Hi, thank you for downloading this new and exciting Wolfenstein adventure. I hope you like this and enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.Anyway this is the first of many Wolfenstein creations thatI will be uploading. So if you liked this one and i hope you did, don't change that channel because there's more on the way.Bye bye.Josh GershmanPlease E-mail any questions or comments to Joshabc@aol.com
