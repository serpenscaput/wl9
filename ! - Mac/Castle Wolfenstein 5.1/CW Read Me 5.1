Castle Wolfenstein
From Wachutiki
Entertainment

Introduction

Welcome to Castle Wolfenstein 5.1! I consider it to be my masterpiece, my best (and toughest) Wolfenstein 3D creation.
This will probably be the hardest scenario you will ever play.

Wolfenstein 3D has been around since
1994 for the Macintosh. After its release,
Greg Ewing later discovered how Wolfenstein levels are constructed, and WolfEdit
was born.

From 1995 to 1997, many fine editors created some of the best Wolfenstein 3D levels
ever. WolfAddict Software took advantage of WolfEdit 2.0's capabilities to add custom
enemies, walls, and the like.

Sadly, many games, such as Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Unreal have
overshadowed Wolfenstein 3D. Many former Wolfenstein players have flocked to
these other games. WolfAddict Software perished in early 1997.

I am the creator of Castle Xeen, The Castle of Lost Souls, Fortress of Fear (formerly
Dragon Cavern), First Strike, and Temple of Doom. Over the years, I've learned how to
make good Wolfenstein levels. I can assure you these levels are of the highest
quality.

Castle Wolfenstein is my latest and greatest creation. It's for all types of W3D players,
from novices to veterans. It features new walls, new enemies, and new objects.

Castle Wolfenstein has been featured in MacAddict Magazine and MacFan, a Dutch
magazine.

Castle Wolfenstein has also been featured on VersionTracker
www.versiontracker.com.

The Story
The year is 1943. World War II is
in full blow. The Nazis have just
assaulted American troops off the
shore of France. You are one of
those who escaped. Your unit's
ammo dumps and your fellow
soldiers have been locked up in
the great Castle Wolfenstein. Your
job is to defeat Hitler and rescue
them. Good luck!

About My Levels
My levels are as rich and as complex as it gets. I have examined many a Wolfenstein
scenario, and I have not seen one be as complex or with as many traps as Castle
Wolfenstein.

These levels are very likely going to frustrate you. I myself have trouble beating them.
Castle Wolfenstein does start out pretty easy, but later it will become difficult. I have
tried to complete it recently, and I have died seven times! This scenario is tough.

You are challenged with a mixture of tough puzzles and hordes of enemies to kill.
Timing and speed is essential. Starting with floor 3-1, you must watch your back every
step of the way. These levels are much more unpredictable than you think.

Illusions will further confuse you. Some walls are invisible. This can be both a
blessing and curse.

Most scenarios, with the exception of
"The Haunted Castle," created by Laz
Rojas, don't take advantage of
Wolfenstein's ghosts. There are ghosts
in Castle Wolfenstein, usually more than
you want to put up with. In the earlier
levels, ghosts are nothing more than a
nuisance. However, as you progress, you
must fight your way past them in order to
proceed to the next level.

Around floor 3-3, things start to get really
nasty. There will likely be more than five

bosses on a level after 3-3. You are USUALLY given enough ammo to hold your
ground. However, you do not know just how many bosses there will be. In order to
stay alive, you may need to lure them somewhere else. I try to make it as hard as
possible to get through levels without fighting more than a few bosses. If you play
Castle Wolfenstein, you'll know what I mean. These are the MEANEST levels you will
ever play. WolfAddict Software and Laz Rojas never made a scenario THIS tough. I've
tested these levels. Even I can't beat some of them.

Save your game often. You're likely to fall into a trap.

Also, don't use cheats unless you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO! It takes a lot of fun out of
the game.

Castle Wolfenstein is constantly being updated. To learn about changes made from
the previous version, refer to "Recent Changes," included with Castle Wolfenstein.

By the way, don't be
surprised if you can't
even run this scenario
(with the full version of
Wolfenstein 3D, of
course). This scenario
may overwhelm those
of you still stuck with a
680x0 Macintosh, and
the latest G4 Macs may
be too fast for it!

Requirements
Castle Wolfenstein requires the full version of Wolfenstein 3D™.
If you don't have Wolfenstein 3D™, e-mail me at wachutiki@att.net

Also, Castle Wolfenstein requires a lot of memory to run. I recommend at least 5 MB
of memory. This shouldn’t be much of an issue for those of you with Power Mac G4s!
If you experience out-of memory messages with Castle Wolfenstein, e-mail me at
wachutiki@att.net and tell me what type of Macintosh you have and how much
memory you have.

How to Install
Drag Castle Wolfenstein into the "Levels" folder. Open Wolfenstein 3D. You will see a
list of scenarios. Pick Castle Wolfenstein from the list, and click OK.

Previous Versions
Do NOT try to load any saved games from a previous version of Castle Wolfenstein on
a newer version! THE LEVELS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED AND WILL CAUSE
WOLFENSTEIN TO CRASH! If you are not finished with an earlier version of Castle
Wolfenstein, simply keep the earlier version in the "Levels" folder along with the new
version.

Enemies
What follows is a summary of the residents of Castle Wolfenstein who will do
everything in their power to make you miserable. And beware of ghosts!

Guard (left): These fellows can easily be mowed down by a
Gatling gun, but they CAN gang up
on you.

S.S. Officer (right): These bad
boys are tough to kill, but they’re
not exactly quick on their feet. As an
added bonus, if you kill them, you
get a free machine gun!

Elite Corporal (left): Corporals are
quick on their feet and can strip you
of half your health before you can say, “Farfenugen!” Watch
out for these guys.

Mutants (right): Mutants are silent;
when they see you, they give no
verbal indication that they wish to
kill you. On top of all this, if they fire
not once, but twice! And they’re as
pale as Michael Jackson.
Ooooh...now THAT’S scary!


Enron Executives (left): Commonly known as a dog. Enron
Executives want YOU as their Scooby Snack. EE’s are quick
little critters and will do everything they can to rip you to
shreds. Watch out for EE’s in Castle Wolfenstein; they’re
specially placed to drive you crazy.

Patrol (right): Sure, they just look like
two guys with guns, but these mean
little mofo’s can knock the wind out of you in a few short
seconds. Requires at least 50 ammo shots or 5 missile
shots to take down.

Captain (left): Captains are fatter than
Marlon Brando and carry a gun larger
than your face. Treat these fellows
the wrong way and you will end up
just being another splatter on the wall.

Goon (right): Goons are huge, quick,
and deadly. It could take up to 8
missile shots to destroy one. Be very
afraid.

Gremlin (left): Not the cute cuddly
kind from the movie. Gremlins throw
scorching fireballs which can
incinerate you on contact. May the
Force be with you should you run into
a gang of these guys.

Grim Reaper (right): These guys are
like Gremlins, only worse; they’re
much tougher to kill. Run and hide if
you see one of these fellows.

Hitler (left): Yep, this is the big guy
himself. When you run into him or
one of his clones, he may be
wearing a tough suit of armor, as
shown to the left, making him
extraordinarily difficult to kill. You only
win the game if you kill him on the last
level.


Objects, Goodies, and First Aid
Here are brief descriptions of various objects and goodies you will encounter in
Castle Wolfenstein.

(left to right) Table, Wacky Statue, Creepy Tree: These are present only as
decoration, but sometimes Creepy Trees can keep you from seeing the enemy!

(left to right): Rations, Oxygen, Grog, Erdöl: Collect 50 of
these goodies (you can mix and match types) and you
get a new life!

(left-right): Medkit, Big John: Medkits restore 10% of your health,
and Big John’s restore 25% of your health.

At certain points in Castle Wolfenstein you will encounter glass windows. You can
shoot through them (enemies too!), but you can’t fire missiles or gas through them.
This also means Gremlins and Grim Reapers can’t throw fireballs at you either.

Also, there is one mysterious object in Castle Wolfenstein that can not only restore
your health to 100% but can also give you an extra life!

One more thing...beware of ghosts!

Level Hints
Little tidbits to make your trek through Castle Wolfenstein less harsh. Also
included are names for the levels.

Level 1-1: Enter!
There's a ton of places to go and lots to see. Just about any place you go, you'll find
treasures and ammo. There is one trap, though. Watch out.

Level 1-2: A Life of
Misery
You don't have much
space to fight, and the
majority of enemies are
corporals. Don't worry.
You'll survive.

Level 1-3: Secrets,
Secrets Everywhere
You receive your first
machine gun on this
level, provided you
enter the right room.
Explore and have fun, but beware! There an invisible wall keeping you from finding the
blue key. YOU must find the way to it! Also, you may have a run-in with ghosts. (NOTE:
Starting with version 3.8.1, the other blue key in the eastern portion of the level has
been replaced with a Big John, so you HAVE to find the blue key the hard way!)

Level 1-4: They're Coming From All Directions!
Many places to go. Everybody is coming at you from all directions. Watch out! On top of
that, there's many traps. Watch your back!

Level 1-5: Ambush
Your first big boss. And it's a Captain! You won't encounter him until the end of the
level, though. Wide, open spaces. And plenty of enemies, too. You will see a ghost on
this level, but it won't hurt you. Be quick on your feet.

Level 2-1: Born to Be Frustrating
Your first real puzzle. Don't have the see secret doors cheat active on this level or else
it'll be no fun. Watch out for ghosts! Many special effects in this level.

Level 2-2: It's A Good Day to Die
Watch your back. The first part of this level is tricky. Lots of Corporals running around.

Level 2-3: Rush Hour
At one point in this level, a lot of enemies come rushing at you from all directions,
including dogs. The dogs will most likely cause the most damage.

Level 2-4: A Wonderful Weapon
Plenty of rooms, ammo and enemies. Good, not so clean fun. In the second section,
you get a flame thrower!

Level 3-1: Captain's Quarters
This is where you get to use that flame thrower! Not only that, you meet your first Goon
here. He's mighty strong! A lot of Nazis live here.

Level 3-2: A Scary Experience
Who's behind those Jeeps? You'll find out if you take the right path. There is a point in
the level where you have to choose one door out of about ten. The other nine or so
conceal ghosts. This puzzle pops up in later levels, too.

Level 3-3: Choose Your Fate
Now things start getting tough. There are three ways to get the blue key. Fight a Grim
Reaper, fight 22 mutants, or wade your way through a sea of ghosts. Also, there's
more than one elevator. Only one is the real exit.

Level 3-4: Ghost Mania
I've beaten this level without cheats, so don't e-mail me whining that you can't beat it.

Level 3-5: One Tough Mother
Quite a unique level. I've never seen another level like this (except for 8-1). The level
grows as you progress. The exits will constantly move, and some exits will take you
back to the first level.
This is the level where
you learn how to fight.
Save often!

Level 2-1: Born to Be
Frustrating
What?! You're back on
level 2-1 after killing all
those monsters?! You
must be pretty
frustrated. Actually,
you're back on 2-1 for
one reason: to get the

missile launcher. Find it and you're off to level 4-1. And yes, you can get past those
ghosts. I've done it without dying OR cheating. (Honest!)

Level 4-1: Bloodlust
A rather mild level compared to what's to come (except for one really nasty invisible
wall puzzle early on). Not much first aid on this level, so you'd better not get hurt.

Level 4-2: A Tad Tipsy
This level may be a bit confusing, but it won't take long to complete if you're quick.
Have your missile launcher handy.

Level 4-3: Tomorrow Always Dies
There is one secret door that can cause you a LOT of trouble if you find it. Trust me.

Level 4-4: A Choice
Run and start shooting right away. Don't die on this level. There is more than one way
to get the yellow key. It all depends which path you take. If you don't hurry up, you're
toast. Don't have the see secret doors cheat active on this level. In the second section,
you must choose one of two exits. Depending on which exit you pick, you're either
going to have one more or one less level to fight your way through.

Level 4-5: Blast From the Past
This level actually came from Dragon Cavern/Fortress of Fear. It's still good, though.
Not too hard. Starting with version 3.9, there's more enemies.

Level 5-1: Haven of the
Mutants
Mutant mania! Nothing
but mutants and
bosses from 5-1 to 5-3.
In this level, you must
find your way through a
maze, and you're not
going to get anywhere
unless you rid yourself
of a certain pest you
can't kill that drains your
life...you'll see. Also, the
invisible walls will drive

you crazy. If you want this level to be fun, don't have the see secret doors cheat active.
SAVE YOUR GAME before you hit the switch to the next level! You'll find out why below.

Level 5-2: Run or Die
If you're not quick on this level, you're toast. You do not walk on this level. You RUN!
Have your flame thrower handy. In this level, the Mutants attack in packs. Mow them
down with the flame thrower. Just to be mean, I'm not going to tell you how to get the
blue key. I'll just say it's hard unless you know how to dodge.

Level 5-3: Relief
Pure, raw action. Enjoy!

Level 6-1: The Comeback
Many, many enemies to shoot at. Pretty easy if you ask me.

Level 6-2: Four Quarters
There are four zones: One zone has plenty of ammo and treasure. In another you can
find the yellow key. In another, you can find the blue key, and in the last, the exits. One
exit takes you back to 3-1. I'm not telling you which one.

Level 6-3: All Roads Lead to Pain
This level resembles
Level 6-8 of
Confrontation, one of
the original
Wolfenstein
scenarios. Secret
doors will need to be
found in order to
progress. You'll have
a hard time getting
past the ghosts at
the end of the level.

Level 6-4: Not for the
Weak
This level will give
you headaches. Run
like hell, my friend.

And find all the secrets you can! You NEED the ammo. Part of the huge maze in this
level is invisible. This is both a blessing and a curse. Also, something that wasn't
present in versions earlier than 5.0 will REALLY make you miserable!

Level 6-5: Another Tough Mother
Ay carumba! So many bosses! I gave you tons of ammo. Use it. One more thing...don't
bother trying to find the Grim Reaper with the blue key. You have to kill all the other
bosses first. Trust me. Did I mention there were ghosts? This level has been known
to cause crashes in
Mac OS 9 and Classic.

Level 7-1: Torture
You may think you can
bypass all those
bosses, but it's
REALLY difficult unless
you know where the
yellow door (or is that
yellow DOORS?) is.

Level 7-2: Simplicity
Wide open spaces.
Not exactly one of my best, but if you don't play your cards right, you'll run out of ammo
quickly. In version 5.0, there's more enemies.

Level 7-3: Shoot 'Em Up
"Where's the blue key? Where's the Grim Reaper? I've killed all these enemies and
there isn't a blue key!" That's what you'll be saying while playing this level. Since when
do you have to leave a Grim Reaper or a blue key out in the open? Don't have cheats
active on this level. It'll ruin all the fun...hee hee hee!

Level 7-4: No Turning Back
At the time of writing, this level was near impossible. Makes you feel thankful I gave
you so much space in my other levels. And THERE'S NO TURNING BACK! Grab
everything you can before you leave the area ASAP or else the ghosts will get you. By
the way, the maze in the level is INVISIBLE! Once again, this is both a curse and a
blessing. The last area of this level will cause your ammo supplies to dwindle. Those
S.S Officers are SO HARD to kill!

Level 7-5: Herr Hitler
Two tips:
1. Run like the wind and shoot at the same time.
2. You have a run-in with one of Hitler's clones. He won't be dead when you kill him.
He'll be back.

Level 8-1: Make It Stop!
Confusing. Very confusing. And difficult, too. You don't know where the exit to 8-2 is. It'll
just take blind stupid luck.

Level 8-2: Closed In
A whole bunch of 3 X 3 rooms. What I call Castle Claustrophobia on steroids. This
level is packed with gas for your beloved flame thrower. Not much space to fight.

Level 8-3: The Labyrinth
A giant maze. On top of that, there's invisible walls! Beware of ghosts!

Level 8-4: Puzzling
Before you can complete this level, you'll need to lure the ghosts into a different room.
I've made this task a bit easier for you. You'll find out how I made it easier by exploring.
Also, there is one point in the level where you're NOT supposed to kill all of the
bosses.

Level 3-4: Not Again
That's right. You have to go through those ghosts again. Also, the exit you pick
determines how much you suffer later on.

Level 9-0: Ammo!
A ton of ammo lies before you. Enjoy it...for now. :)

Level 9-1: Goodbye, Ammo!
Those S.S. Officers have one purpose: To drain your ammo supplies. By the time
you're finished with them, you'll be down to petty bullets. You shouldn't have trouble
dispatching them, provided you've made it THIS far! You will repeat this process two or
three more times, depending on which exit you picked on level 3-4.

Level 9-9: Hitler
This is it. The end. Use that gas on those dogs quickly, then kill all 75 of them as fast
as you can. You need all the health you can in order to take on the Hitlers. (Yes, that
was plural.) All you need to do is take out one of them to win, but you do have limited
ammo. Therein lies the challenge. Good luck to you!

Strategies
Castle Wolfenstein is tough. Very tough. Presented below are strategies for selected
levels. These strategies, along with the hints and tips in the two previous chapters,
will help you get out of Castle Wolfenstein ALIVE. Often, many of the below strategies
apply on other levels.

Level 3-1
Don't rush into a room. You don't know how many enemies are going to be there. The
flame thrower you have will definitely help you. Take out the enemies while making
sure you don't get too hurt. Duck into an empty room to recuperate if needed.

Level 3-3
Speed is the key at the beginning of the level. Rush out of the elevator and shoot until
everyone's dead. The dogs will be a real pest.
Also, open every door you can (saving the game beforehand). If a door conceals a
ghost, make absolutely sure no enemy gets near that door. If a ghost is set loose, the
level will rapidly be rendered unplayable.

Level 3-5
The exits will constantly change. You will have to deal with ghosts.
This strategy will be helpful for future levels but is especially helpful here. You will
often have to take out bosses. Using a flame thrower or missile launcher, fire the
ammo type of your choice at the boss until they get into shooting position. Back off.
When they're finished firing, rush into their face and fire some more ammo. Back off
again. Repeat this process
until the boss is dead.

Level 4-2
Watch your back. There will
always be enemies running
around.
In the level, there is a long
hallway. At the end of this
hallway lies two Grim
Reapers. Using missile
launchers, there is a way to
take these bad boys out
without them hurting you.

Gremlins can't touch you through glass.

Level 5-1
Don't waste your ammo on the mutants in the eastern portion of the level. Hide behind
walls so the mutants can't shoot at you. The flame thrower and missile launcher are
both useless through glass, and bullet supplies are sparse, so watch how you use
your bullets.

Level 5-2
You don't necessarily have to kill ALL the Death Knights to complete the level.....

Level 6-2
Lure ghosts into unoccupied rooms. They can't open doors.
Also, you'll run out of missiles and gas if you don't watch yourself. Conserve conserve
conserve! Don't use your special ammo unless you absolutely have to.

Level 6-4
At the beginning of the level, rush out into one corner, break out your flame thrower,
and fire away.
Also, don't go into the invisible wall maze when you're fighting the bosses. You won't
be able to find your way out.
Make sure the ghosts don't touch you. Your health will likely be drained on this level.

Level 6-5
DO NOT WASTE YOUR AMMO! You need all the ammo you can get. Missiles are your
best bet. Once you run out of those, use gas. You have enough gas to take out all of
the bosses. Just don't
get hurt in the process.
If I were you, I would not
rush out into the
western corridor unless
I KNEW there were no
bosses out there. The
northern hallway will
usually be cleaned out.

Level 7-1
Where are those
mutants coming from?
As always, don't get too

hurt.
If you see bosses later in the level, run backwards and shoot.

Level 7-2
In my opinion, this is the most exciting level of the entire scenario. If you do not run,
you're toast. I mean it. In fact, if you don't start shooting the SECOND this level begins,
you're toast. You will run low on ammo. You will spend the entire level running and
shooting at the same time.
Once you get past the yellow door, search for a secret door. Believe me, the search
will be worth it.

Level 7-5
Find the secret door right away. It's in the eastern hallway. When you begin, kill the
mutant, and make a right turn. The secret door is between the two doors.
In previous versions of Castle Wolfenstein, you didn't have a fighting chance against
the Death Knights in the western portion of the level. Now you do...providing you don't
waste the ammo.

Level 8-1
At the beginning, run until you find an exit. Otherwise, you're toast.
Later on, you'll have to take on hordes of bosses. This will take MANY tries to
accomplish. Don't let your ammo supplies run low.

Level 9-1
Use your flame thrower first, followed by missiles, then bullets. Don't use up all of your
missiles on the first
wave of S.S Officers.
Level 9-9
Don't get hurt. If you
lose your life and you're
not playing at the
easiest difficulty level,
you're toast.
Focus on killing one
Hitler. You don't have
enough ammo to take
all of them.

Tips
Castle Wolfenstein is an unusually tough scenario. I usually end up dying! Therefore,
there are a few things you need to know in order to survive before you delve into the
terrible fortress that Castle Wolfenstein is. Note that the tips stated here does NOT
apply to every level!

1. You do not walk in Castle Wolfenstein. You RUN!

2. Save often!

3. You will often have to go through the process of trial and error in order to solve
puzzles. (Save the game, try, if objective not obtained, restore game.)

4. If you encounter a ghost as a result of opening a door or secret door, chances are
you've ruined your chances of completing the level.

5. Watch your back. Enemies tend to come at you from all directions.

6. Don't underestimate the viciousness of dogs in Castle Wolfenstein. They attack in
packs, and they're trained to KILL!

7. Save the game before you try anything funky, like throwing an exit switch.

8. Speaking of exit switches, many levels have multiple exits. Some take you to the
next level, some take you to an earlier level, some return you to the same level, some
unleash a ghost upon you, and some simply don't do anything at all.

9. Don't make yourself
invincible unless you
absolutely have to.

10. Use the see secret
doors cheat when
you're really stumped.

11. Speaking of secret
doors, I don't mark
them in any way
(usually), and they
usually need to be
found in order to
complete a level.

12. Conserve your ammo! Also, use the right kind of the ammo on the right kind of
enemy. If you have gas and missiles, don't go around wasting bullets on Goons and
Gremlins.

13. If you play at any difficulty level above "Can I Play Daddy?", you're in for a real treat.

14. Invisible walls are a mixed blessing. They can keep enemies from shooting at
you, but they can also impede your progress in a level. In most cases, think of
invisible walls as a road under construction. When a road is under construction, you
must find a detour route. The same applies here. In this case, secret doors are
usually the detour.

15. Expect all levels past 3-3 to have the maximum 127 enemies. I do not go easy on
you.

16. When entering a room, immediately turn around and look for enemies. If present,
open fire.

17. Don't rush into a large room. Large rooms usually conceal huge numbers of
enemies.

18. Be suspicious of large, empty rooms. Some Nazis may be hiding somewhere.

19. In all levels past 3-3, you must obtain both yellow and blue keys in order to
complete the level.

20. When dealing with bosses, fire with a STRAIGHT AIM! Your weapon must be
looking RIGHT AT the
boss! If you don't know
how to get a straight aim,
learn fast.

21. Shoot through gaps
in the wall. You can see
the enemy, but the
enemy cannot see you.

22. Patrols and Captains
aren't tough to kill,
provided you have
missiles. Goons are
hard to kill with
ANYTHING. Grim
Reapers is even tougher
to kill than Goons.

23. Gremlins=Death, especially when they attack in packs.

24. Hitler (or his clones) in armor isn't hard to kill. The unarmored Hitler takes about
15 missiles to kill.

25. Don't waste first aid. If you have 96% health, don't pick up a Big John. Wait until
you're more injured before you do that.

26. Make sure you have a straight aim when shooting missiles at bosses. That way,
you won't waste many missiles.

27. Mutants are silent and deadly. They can easily take you by surprise.

28. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. You're not likely to do everything right the
first time around.

29. These levels can frustrate the player. (It's even happened to me occasionally!) If
you get frustrated, go away, and come back when you feel better.

30. Some things (for example, objects) don't do what they're supposed to do.

31. Life is cruel. So is Castle Wolfenstein. My friend, you will be tortured in this
scenario.

32. Shoot once,
shoot twice,
shoot again,
and then, when
everyone's
dead, ask a few
questions.

33. Never
confront a boss
in close
quarters unless
you absolutely
have to.

34. For that
matter, never
confront more
than two
enemies in

close quarters unless you absolutely have to.
35. Ghosts can really make you miserable. If you can, lure them into a locked room
(one that's closed in by yellow or blue doors).

36. Have fun!

Does Wolfenstein 3D Work on Power Mac
G4’s?

Short answer: YES!

Long answer: Wolfenstein 3D is old. REALLY old! In computer years, it’s
ancient. More ancient than Julius Caesar. Yet amazingly, I’ve played
Wolfenstein 3D in Classic on an iMac with Mac OS 10.1.5, and it runs
beautifully.

However, because Castle Wolfenstein 5.1 exploits many features that
were not present in the original Wolfenstein 3D levels, the game may, at
one point, not know what to do and crash. This will not happen often. It
will run 95% of the time. It is most likely to crash with Mac OS 7.5.x and
Mac OS 7.6. Any OS less recent or more recent than those versions
should have no trouble handling Wolfenstein 3D and Castle Wolfenstein.
Should a problem arise, feel free to e-mail me at wachutiki@att.net, and
I will try to help you.

Don't Have Wolfenstein?

Castle Wolfenstein requires the full version of Wolfenstein 3D. Most
people don't have the full version. Unfortunately, MacPlay no longer
distributes Wolfenstein 3D for the Mac.

If you want the full version, e-mail me at
wachutiki@att.net

I will send you the Web addresses for both Wolfenstein 3D AND the full
version of WolfEdit 2.0, so you can edit my levels.

I also have the PC version of Wolfenstein 3D and its sequel, Spear of
Destiny, but I cannot offer troubleshooting tips for either game.

If you don't have the Internet, I will gladly send Wolfenstein and WolfEdit
by e-mail.


Shareware? I think not!

This is a scenario for a game that was released EIGHT YEARS AGO! To charge
money for it would be foolhardy! You want a good shareware game? Go download
Snood from www.snood.org. And while you’re there, go to the Forum section and
whine about there not being a version for Mac OS X.

A Little Slice of History

The story of how I became such an excellent Wolfenstein author is long and twisted.
Allow me to share it with you.

Around 1994, I bought Wolfenstein 3D™ First Encounter at a CompUSA for $5. I tried
it, and it was OK, but it ended up on the shelf.

Then, in 1995, a friend of mine gave me a copy of the full version of Wolfenstein 3D™.
I played all the levels many times over. I wanted more.

I gave up Wolfenstein after getting sick of all the levels until very late in 1995, when I
tried out America Online. There, I discovered WolfEdit, a Wolfenstein level editing
program. I downloaded it and created what would later become my very first scenario,
Castle Xeen. It was completed in very early 1996. I have left the very first level I ever
created hidden in the version of Wolfenstein
3D™ I distribute to people who want it.

Castle Xeen was poorly designed. There
were tons of bugs. It was 40 levels long
however, so the action lasted quite a while.
Xeen made its first appearance at Doug
Ingram's Wolfenstein 3D Page, along with
Compact Maps Set 1, which can no longer
be found ANYWHERE on the Web. Doug's
page has since expired.

Then, I started work on The Castle of Lost
Souls, which was actually called MegaTrainer for quite a while, and which I
completed about a month later. It was
marginally better than Castle Xeen. It was

completed around March 1996, along with Compact Maps Set 2. The Castle of Lost
Souls also surfaced on Doug's page.

Everything about Xeen and Lost Souls was shoddy and immature. The levels weren't
very good, and neither were the abstracts. They were incredibly immature and
childish.

I updated Xeen and Lost Souls and uploaded them to Info-Mac. They can still be
downloaded today. The readmes were real immature and corny. What follows is a
little promo for Dragon Cavern/Fortress of Fear found in the Castle Xeen 2.0 Readme:

Coming Soon:
The Dragon Cavern!
You are Hans D. Fritz. After defeating Hitler and Dr. Schabbs once again, you leap out of a
window. Whoa! It's storming outside! In an attempt to get back into the castle, you are struck by
lightning! You awake in a dark place! What's a French soldier to do?

See what I mean? Immature.

I started work on Dragon Cavern I promoted Dragon Cavern like there was no
tomorrow. In reality, the levels weren't THAT good. They aren't at all as good as ANY
level from Castle Wolfenstein.

While working on Dragon Cavern, I met up with Joel Adams, who worked for
WolfAddict Software. We became partners and created a VERY popular Wolfenstein
3D page, J.J's Wolfenstein 3D Reviews (or something like that). There, we reviewed
anything that had to do with Wolfenstein 3D for the Macintosh. I even promoted
Dragon Cavern there. Also, J.J's Reviews is where The Bugs and Daffy Voting Page
(my brainchild) got its start. The site closed down around August.

Dragon Cavern came out around April, but it had serious bugs which were fixed by a
man named Bob Thijs. After that, Dragon Cavern 2.0 debuted. Along with Dragon
Cavern 2.0 came Tiger Cavern, Compact Maps Set 3, Compact Maps fer 1st Set 1 (1st
Encounter Compact Maps), The All NEW MONDO Wolfenstein Sounds (no longer
found anywhere on the Net), Tiger Hacks, and The Wolfenstein Funhouse (the less I
say about that disaster, the better).

Around June, I started work on Return to Castle Xeen, which later became First Strike.

Return to Castle Xeen was the first scenario I created with WolfEdit 2.0. It took
advantage of a few of its features. A later version, before it became First Strike,
featured a few custom graphics.

In late 1996, Return to Castle Xeen Beta 2.0 debuted on Info-Mac as part of Bad to the
Bone, a small collection of my scenarios.

I began work on Temple of Doom in mid-1997. This was the cruelest scenario I had
ever created. There were tons of enemies to kill and tons of dirty tricks, as well as
many custom graphics. Temple of Doom III debuted on Info-Mac in late 1997.
Unfortunately, Temple of Doom III had a horrible bug which rendered it unplayable on
Power Macs. First Strike 1.0 came out around this point, too.

In early 1998, I began work on Castle Wolfenstein. Because Temple of Doom had
been so cruel and unkind to the player, I decided to make this a gentle scenario. The
levels were topnotch. I even started to use some special effects. Version 1.1 debuted
on Info-Mac in April 1998.

I ceased work on Castle Wolfenstein with the exception of the creation of a few levels
during the summer. Around August 1998, I started working on it again with a
vengeance. I tossed the sissy nice-guy atmosphere and made the levels as cruel as
humanly possible. I also added a TON of custom graphics. Castle Wolfenstein 3.0
debuted in November 1998.

Also, I had noticed that nobody had uploaded anything to the Wolfenstein section of
Info-Mac since April. So, I threw together 36 scenarios that I thought were good (most
of them mine) and named it Awesome Resurrection. It debuted on Info-Mac around
September.

Following Castle Wolfenstein 3.0 came Wolfenstein Adventures, Temple of Doom 4.5
(the bug-fix of that grievous bug mentioned earlier), Fortress of Fear (Dragon Cavern
renamed), First Strike II (with custom graphics), WolfenPC, and Compact Maps Set 5
(ALL of my Compact Maps).

Packages of scenarios I distributed to Info-Mac included Awesome Resurrection 1
and 2, Wolfenstein Around the World, Macinstein 3D, Breakthrough Deluxe, The
Scenarios of Laz,
Through the Portal,
and Wolfenstein
Classics (included
with Castle
Wolfenstein 3.0).

I again ceased work on
Castle Wolfenstein
until March 1999. I am
in the process of
adding special effects
to all of the levels as
well as the last final
levels.


After weeding out many bugs and extensive testing, Castle Wolfenstein was
completed on July 22, 1999.

During 2000 and 2001, I made a few Wolfenstein Adventures, but not much else.
However, I still want to keep the Wolfenstein 3D spirit alive. This is why I’ve chosen to
rerelease Castle Wolfenstein.

My Products
I have many, many other scenarios and related things circulating the Internet. Most of
them can be found at Info-Mac, but you may never know where they pop up. Some of
my later scenarios have been included on CD-ROMs of several magazines, including
MacAddict.

Castle Xeen 1.0
My first scenario ever. 39 levels. Pure, raw action with plenty of level flaws.

Castle Xeen 2.0
A marginal improvement over version 1.0. Recently released to Info-Mac.

Castle of Lost Souls 1.0
My second real scenario. 40 levels. Pure, raw action with a lot less flaws than Castle
Xeen. Version 2.0 never came out. Recently released to Info-Mac.

Dragon Cavern/Fortress of Fear
My third real scenario. 25 levels. Simple puzzles and many enemies to shoot at. A
perfectly good scenario. Some early versions had a serious bug that ended the game
too early.

Tiger Cavern
Supposed to be a First Encounter version of Dragon Cavern. 6 levels. Didn't catch
much notice, so I dropped it.

First Strike/Return to Castle Xeen
My fourth scenario and the first scenario designed with WolfEdit 2.0. 25 levels. A cross
between Dragon Cavern and Temple of Doom. Not too easy, not too hard, but I never
really finished it.

Temple of Doom
One of my masterpieces. 31 levels. Tough. Really tough. Cruel. Unkind to the player.
Early versions crashed Power Macs. Version 1.5 corrects this partially.


Castle Wolfenstein
My latest scenario and one of my finest masterpieces. Currently at 50+ levels, but
always growing. Features new graphics. Castle Wolfenstein has been featured in
MacAddict magazine and Macintosh magazines in Europe.
