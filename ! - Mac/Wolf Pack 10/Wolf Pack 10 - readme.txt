Wolf Pack 9 is a compilation of three scenarios by Andres Vialpando. As follows:
* Drokiss has one map. Although these scenarios are supposed to be for First Encounter, this mod uses Second/Third Encounter enemies: officers and mootants. Not very interesting otherwise.
* Farphen Nugen has two maps. I have absolutely no idea what is the name supposed to mean. The most interesting part of the scenario is the second map, which is basically one large room with a horde of SS to put pressure on you.
* Fighting Frenzy has one map. A very simplistic affair, you overcome increasingly difficult challenges over the course of a few rooms.

Wolf Pack 10 is a compilation of four scenarios. As follows:
* Resistence (sic) is futile has two maps. There's a few interesting combat set pieces in here, like enemies behind rows of tables. Bar fight, anyone?
* Willow has two maps. Very similar to Resistence, in that it's almost entirely grey brick with a lot of narrow passages.
* Yo! has two maps. It's red and blue and feels rather empty at times.
* Finally, Zeran has seven maps. The floors are mostly small to very small, but at least make good use of texture variety. There's some combat difficulty progression too, but then the final map is a huge spike and something of a slog. Be warned.
