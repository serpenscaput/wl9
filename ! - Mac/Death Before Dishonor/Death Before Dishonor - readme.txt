Complementing the main release this time is Death Before Dishonor, a small, pure mapset. I don't know much about it, not even who made it; all I know comes from Clubey, who tells us it's a First Encounter mapset originally made with a piece of software called Wolfmaker, a procedural map generator. Ahm, well, regardless. Give it a go anyway, you could be plesantly surprised.

Or not.
