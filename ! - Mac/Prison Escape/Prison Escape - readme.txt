Prison Escape by an unknown author: five maps for the First Encounter, chock full of Nazis. Lots of secrets and treasure too. The level architecture starts out rather claustrophobic, but gradually opens up, culminating in a wide open area where you will be flanked from both sides. Be warned.

Probably some inmate.
