Maze copy by Casey Bob (not to be confused with Casey Renz). Four maps for the First Encounter. The first three ones are very small and not really notable. It's the fourth level where this scenario takes its name from, as you have to enter a large maze populated by dogs - with a group of bosses on your tail! The author describes this set as shareware, meaning that if you sent him $5, you would receive another five maps by e-mail. Anyone go for it?
