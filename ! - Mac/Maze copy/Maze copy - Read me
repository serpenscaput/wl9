Install these levels into Wolfenstein using WolfEdit.Here is a basic description of the 4 levels:Level 1: Just a regular level I made.Level 2: A boss levelLevel 3: This level has just about everything in it.  There is one door where after you open it you can kill a hallway full of enemies in seconds if you have the gatling gun.Leve 4: This is my favorite level.  You have to run away from many boss guys.  You go through some rooms then enter a giant maze with dogs scattered about.  You have to find the keys and get to the door before you run into one of the bosses.note:  This level is really boring if you cheat.  Few can get by it without cheating.There is a strange bug that makes some of the secret doors visible. But I'm sure you don't care. =)If you would like 5 more Wolfenstein levels please support shareware by sending $5 along with your AOL screen name to:Crasy Bob software7987 Nutmeg LaneLiverpool, NY 13090I will send the 5 levels over E-mail.(Please note in the letter if you have stuffit on your computer.) =)
