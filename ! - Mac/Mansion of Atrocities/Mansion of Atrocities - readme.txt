And speaking of mansions, it's time for our last offer and it is truly the offer to end all offers, the masterstroke, the ultimate deal. The Mansion... of Atrocities. Dun dun DUNNN! An incredible TEN full-blown First Encounter floors await you in this astonishing manor, and I'll be honest here, most of it is either rather rectangular or somewhat mazy, but you'll be hard pressed to find so many rooms and passages for such a low price. Think of all the storage and living space! One small kink is, you will have to share this Lebensraum with a number of gentlemen from you-know-which-country. Let me tell you, you have probably never seen this many people dressed in blue in your entire life. But you know what they say, sharing is caring. Or... do you really care? Maybe it's time for them to go? Heh, heh... Do note that since both Mansions were designed by Japanese architects, any appended documentation is written in illegible moonrunes, but in this case, a translation of its history was gracefully provided. Did you know the place used to be inhabited by Nazis at some point? Yeah, now it's just regular Germans living here. Apparently there's a difference.
