springtime for hitlerWayne & Tim(8 levels for the 2nd Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 2nd Encounter, and was made by scanmantim and his good friend Wayne. Upon Tim's modest request, I have credited the scenario to "Wayne & Tim". They are two of the very few active Mac Wolf scenario creators that I know of, and I so dearly hope everyone who plays this scenario or any other of his to go to the Wolfenmac Club at Yahoo! and post some positive comments. Please remember, your mail could be the one to persuade and encourage the authors to go on releasing new scenarios in the future!!If you have any suggestions concerning this scenario, directly contact the co-author at the Wolfenmac Club at Yahoo!, or please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpCopyrightsOh, no! I forgot to ask Tim about this. I presume that if you give proper credit, and do not claim it to be your creation, you're pretty much free to use it. In any case, go to the Wolfenmac Club at Yahoo! and contact the author for any specific instructions. Otherwise, do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
