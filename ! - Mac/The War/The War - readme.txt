Going further, we have The War, a single-map scenario by an unknown author and a title that's truly a perfect fit for today's theme. It's the simplest thing ever: a massive one area where you get tons of supplies and are tasked with killing a horde of enemies (including a couple bosses) occupying the opposite corner of the map. I have no idea how this map was supposed to work, considering it exceeds the original game's object limit by far, but there you go. On MacenWolf you can play it in its full glory.
