Wolfenstein Adventures 2001Special Preview Edition (BETA!!!)All-new Wolfenstein nightmares for the new millenniumFrom the creator of Castle Wolfenstein, introducing all-new Wolfenstein Adventures that boggle the mind. These one-level scenarios are so hard it's scary.Scenario DescriptionsADC-Operation Sahara DeathThe first of what I hope to be many in the Alvon Del Camio series of scenarios. You start out surrounded by deadly wasps, and it's up to only your instincts and a pistol to escape alive.Britney Spears Cooks RiceYou need to move at the speed of light in order to even survive.Crouching Tiger, Hidden WombatWith limited ammo and almost nonexistent supplies of first aid at your disposal, it will be a miracle if you come out of this incredibly crowded, closed-in prison in one piece.Dr. OctogoldeneyefingerYou, British Superagent James Bond 007, must complete three quests in order to escape. 1) Wade your way through an invisible maze. 2) Make it past a horde of invincible ghosts. 3) Defeat a pack of Uber-Mutants, their guards, and finally, Dr. Octogoldeneyefinger himself. Beware of traps!The Siege of Slim ShadyOver 100 killer wasps. One pistol. Nothing more. Be afraid. Be very afraid.The Wacky Misadventures of JoeyYou must fight a entire squadron of Uber-Mutants while equipped with limited ammo, limited first aid, and limited weaponry. Good luck. You'll need it.The Wolfenstein Adventures require the full version of Wolfenstein 3D.
