Hi, hi! We've got multiple scenarios for you this time, all under the umbrella name of Wolfenstein Adventures 2001 by Josh Mills (here under the moniker of El Toro Entertainment).

We start with ADC - Operation Sahara Death which is easily the biggest, most involved scenario of the bunch, almost large enough to count as a separate mod. Despite the name, it does not seem to have much in common with deserts. You start in a hellish-looking room surrounded by deadly giant wasps, so you have to get moving or die. What follows is a single, but extremely extensive level that uses a lot of new graphics to keep things fresh. ADC stands for Alvon Del Camio, which was supposed to be a series of multiple scenarios eventually; however, I believe these plans were never realized.

Next up is Britney Spears Cooks Rice, a small but hectic single-floor scenario where you better start moving immediately, or face the deadly consequences.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wombat is a brutal affair where you will be heavily starved for health while trying to keep a massive horde of enemies at bay.

In Dr. Octogoldeneyefinger you play as Bond, James Bond, and your task is as follows: brave an invisible maze, escape a bunch of ghosts, then kill the doctor and his pack of Ubermutant guards. And be careful with secret pushwalls... You might find more than you bargained for.

In The Siege of Slim Shady, the killer wasps from Operation Sahara Death make a comeback. It's 100 of them versus the one of you in a very large room and all you have is a pistol... Fortunately there is a way to get a bigger gun if you snoop around enough, though that's going to be challenging with all these enemies pursuing you. Good luck.

And finally, The Wacky Misadventures of Joey is a very small but nevertheless very difficult floor where you have to fight a significant number of bosses with limited resources. That's all there is to it. Go start killing people.
