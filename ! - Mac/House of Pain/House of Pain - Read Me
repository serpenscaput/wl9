Z†RICH, 1943.   After many successful covert operations against the very heart of the German war machine, a supposed friend betrayed you to the SS.  You were "escorted" from the streets of neutral ZŸrich into the local Nazi headquarters office.  There, the worst rumors were confirmed as you were dragged to the basement to suffer the dreaded SS torture chambers.You've managed to keep your secrets so far, but you know it is only a matter of time.  One early morning you see your chance.  The guard allows you a moment in the latrine, and dozes off.  You snapped his neck with a quick, precise motion, as you'd practiced in commando school.  Now, you need only to escape from the dungeon, and get back to the streets of ZŸrich, where you can take refuge in the Free French Embassy.  No problem.___Hints:  Be careful with your ammo.  Never go on to the next level without a full load, if you have a choice.  I hate it when one random panel in a long hallway is a secret door.  Most of the secret doors, but not all of them, will have some distinguishing characteristic.I think this set is pretty hard.  I did the real set on Death Incarnate, and found it challenging, but not excessively so.  I finally completed this on Baby Bonnet, and only by running away when it got tough.  If you finish on Death Incarnate, and kill everyone, I'd love to hear all about it.  Even if you don't, I'd still like to hear what you think.Brian Jonesbbjones@leland.stanford.edu___Big ol' thanks to Bill Tompkins for lots of interesting ideas and play testing."Here, Bill, try this.""But I have to work!""Aw, come on!""Well... only for a little while...."___(c) 1994 Brian JonesPlease distribute freely, but include this file and this notice.May not be sold individually or as part of a package.All rights reserved by Brian Jones, 1994
