Having thus introduced one of the greatest hit of the market, let us move to an even greater hit: House of Pain! There's three full First Encounter floors to live in (really big and intricate ones too), and get this, you even receive ownership of a small part of the street and several small adjacent buildings! Can you comprehend what an incredible deal this is? As the name suggests, this house is presented mostly with fans of - let's say - a certain lifestyle in mind, but of course adventurous souls are free to experiment even if they don't normally fancy themselves discipline aficionados. Do note that the object is staffed (rather predictably) by Germans. These particular Jerries come from the Swiss SS headquarters where they used to run the most infamous torture chambers in all Europe, so you know they're perfectly equipped for the task. However, we must inform you with great sorrow that Gretel Grosse, who used to successfully run many an establishment of this type, is no longer with us; you will have to deal with her brother, Hans, instead. But you don't mind, do you? That would be improper.
