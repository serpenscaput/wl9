Pussenbootzenstein is a scenario by Clubey, in fact a demo of a project he never quite got around to finishing. Inspired by European tales of walking cats and some Japanese short stories and poetry, Clubey replaced guards with antropomorphic cats and put the player through four maps of densely packed feline slaughter. Other features, like (presumably) new walls, sounds, or a storyline, never came to be.

See the included original readme for more details.
