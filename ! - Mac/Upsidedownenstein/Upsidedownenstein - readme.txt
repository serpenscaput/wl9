Upsidedownenstein is a Third Encounter scenario by Alan Hardin. The gimmick here is that all enemy graphics were reversed, so that they look like they're walking on the ceiling. There's not much to say about it otherwise. There's only one, very small map (although you get to fight most of the usual Wolfenstein enemy cast) and some graphics have transparency issues. Oh well, they can't all be winners.
