psidedownenstein


Upsidedownenstein is my first post of a level.  It is only one short level.  But it is tough.  I changed all the enemies so it looks like they are walking on the ceiling.  It was tested on the commercial version.  It might work on other versions.  Please send me your comments at alan.hardin@paulsson.com
