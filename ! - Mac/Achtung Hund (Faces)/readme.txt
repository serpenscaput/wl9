Achtung Hund (Faces) by ToddAM [?] is a 3-floor scenario for the First Encounter. I have no idea what is the word "Faces" meant to indicate. The maps are very extensive, spanning pretty much the entire mapping grid, and are populated by a reasonable number of enemies. Todd was able to produce decently creative output within the usual First Encounter limitations.
