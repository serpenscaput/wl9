A Madman's RepriseI should've known I'd end up like this. I finally let my mind, and the fucked up world inside it, get the best of me. I haven't dealt with any Nazi mutants, or their ilk for at least 5 or 6 years. I don't remember how long I've been in this ward, but I remember almost everything else. There's no reason to count the days anymore. Every day is the same. Hell, I might be better of if mutants really WERE chewing me to the bone. Sometimes, it's as if they're trying to come back into my life. I heard them tell me some bullshit about a time machine. They're more persistant than any of my exes. If I had a time machine, I'd go back and stop myself from telling anyone about them. Hell, if I had a time machine, I'd... why is there a gun here? NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! Is it happening again? Why is it happening again? If I'm going to die alone in this miserably empty cell, fine, but I'm done with Nazis. It isn't real! It's not real anymore! I'm not going back there! Maybe one of the guards just left this in here. Maybe this is mine. I can't let this whole thing happen to me again. Why don't I just shoot myself? Why CAN'T I shoot myself? Regardless of whether or not they're real, that'd be the best way out of this. No. I need answers first. I might as well look around outside my cell. How much worse could it get?
