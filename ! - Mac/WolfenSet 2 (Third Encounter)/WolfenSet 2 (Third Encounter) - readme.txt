WolfSet 1 (Third Encounter) contains five scenarios. In alphabetical order:

* Attack one Hans has one map and as the name suggests, it culminates in a showdown with Hans Grosse in a rather grandiosely decorated room. 
* Once Again has three maps. They're very small, but that doesn't mean there's a dearth of enemies to face; quite the opposite in fact.
* Random House '98 has three maps. Similar to Once Again in terms of size, but area designs are much more varied in here.
* Red Brick House has four maps. It's what it says on the tin. Maps decrease in size over time, to the point where the last two aren't very meaningful.
* The Haunted House has one map. Yes you will find ghosts here, as well as quite a lot of other enemies. Good luck.

WolfenSet 2 (Third Encounter) also contains five scenarios. In alphabetical order:
* A Boss Castle has seven maps. Not bad. Anders thinks it's some of his best work and I'm inclined to agree. There are some interesting designs in here, including a map where most of the content is optional. Fun stuff.
* Attack on Trans has one map. This time the room where you face the boss is considerably smaller, making the fight tougher. But you'll manage.
* Battle Fest has one map. It's surprisingly sparsely guarded and generally feels like an odd one in the bunch.
* The succintly called "die" has one map. Probably the hardest map of the whole lot. Plenty of big guards around.
* Lastly, Pretty Bossy if you ask me has one map. You will also be facing multiple big guys, but there's more space to maneuver in this time.

WolfenSet 3 (Third Encounter) contains four scenarios. In alphabetical order: 
 * A weird level has one map. The title is apt - we're dealing with a huge, open area with a ludicrous number of bosses and lotsa flamethrower ammo to fry them with. Might not be beatable without cheats.
 * The Unbeatable has five maps. They don't start out too bad, but the last one... Let's just say you're not getting out in one piece without god mode.
 * The Works has one map. Very large, but also very rectangular. Chock full of enemies too.
 * Trick or Treat (how appropriate) has one map. If I called the last one chock full of enemies, this one is overflowing.
 
 That's it for today, but stay tuned for more Anders Vialpando maps in the near future.
