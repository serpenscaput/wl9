A FINAL THANK YOU-----I'd like to express super-mega-ultra-hyper and otherwise large thanks to Bruce Ryder.  I had thought I'd finished Breakthrough, but thanks to the sane Mr. Ryder, I was forced to make the game a little bit easier.  What does this mean?  It means that Breakthrough is now more fun to play.Bruce is currently working on a set of levels entitled "Operation Knotaginstein."  Keep your eyes peeled!!AJT
