Mission Squirrel Worldby StevenM482 (19 levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 1st Encounter, and was made by StevenM482. I know nothing about this author besides the fact that he made this scenarioIf you know anything about this author or of any other scenario of his, please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpWARNING!The last levels, 7-1, is set in a large room that takes up more than 90% of the floor surface. Sometimes such too big areas cause your computer to freeze. Be careful. CopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
