Katzenjammer, created by Jim G Phynn...For those of you that do not speak German, Katzenjammer is the German word for hangover.The creators of Castle Katzenjammer must have been drunk.  Hence the name.  Talk in the small villages today is that they are unsure of who is crazier...  The designer of Castle Katzenjammer, or the last person who attempted to infiltrate it.   They say his bones are carefully hidden somewhere inside.  With its winding hallways, numerous secret passages, and seeming endless numbers of other goodies scattered about, the Katzenjammer kids must surely have had many a rousing game of Hide-And-Seek.Lord Katzenjammer loved his dogs.  They are well trained and obedient.  And they just love to play with visitors.I ask that you play this game, enjoy it.  Please Email me with any comments you might have.  My address is JimGPhynn@aol.com.  Please feel free to distribute this scenario, along with this READ ME file, to your friends, neighbors, relatives, even your enemies.  They will hate you for it...I am also interested in collecting a best times list for level 2.  If you complete the second floor, collecting all treasures, killing all guards, and finding all secret passageways, please, Email me, and tell me the time(s).  (A screen shot of the score scene would be perfect...)  My personal record is 21:44.  That tells you something about the size and scope of this board...Anyway, enjoy this scenario.  I spent many an evening trying to figure out the nuances and nooks and crannies of Castle Katzenjammer.  I hope you appreciate it...Jim G.JimGPhynn@aol.com
