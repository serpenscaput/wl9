Squirrel World Read Me-To run Squirrel World you must have WolfEdit 1.1.  You also must increase the ram to Wolfedit or it will not install all of the 19 levels included.  If you don't increase the ram WolfEdit will tell you it can not install the levels.  Good  Luck and these levels are hard but I can beat them on a PowerMac 6100/66 so you should not have any problems.Please Give me any comments at:StevenM482 on AOL																										StevenM482@aol.com for the internetGood luck
