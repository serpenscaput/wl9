Science marches on.

Why this introduction, you may ask? And why is this 10-level Third Encounter scenario by Masahiro Iwakura called The Tears of Dolly? Surely it's not about Dolly the cloned sheep? Well, it is, all thanks to the brief but rather clever storyline behind this mod. In short, before his death, Hitler has deposited a sample of his genital cells, anticipating the rise of the Fourth Reich. Now the year is 1997 and Axe von Muellen (leader of the neo-Nazi party) and Dr. Hase (the maverick scientist) succesfully clone Adolf Hitler in their secret South American lab! The path towards reviving the world's second greatest nightmare - another German Reich - is now open. It's up to you to post some roadblocks.

Other than a few rather silly new wall textures, the focus here is certainly placed on the ten new maps. These are competently done, full of varied designs and interesting gunfights. There is some non-linearity and normal progression is often hidden behind secret pushwalls. Opposition is adequate to the resources you're given, which is often not all that much (but worry not, you will be pitted against multiple bosses sooner or later). An interesting member of the Mac family for sure.
