And so at the end of our journey, we arrive to the Third Reich. A pretty cool place, isn't it? No? Well I suppose you're right. Clearly, Wolf modders were thinking the same thing, as the friendly country's name surprisingly rarely appears in mod titles. Truth be told, this one is a tad of a stretch. In 2009 (demo) and 2010 (11-map full version), Dynamite released The Third Reich Episode 1: A Dark Secret, with new maps and graphics as well as code changes made by WSJ. Story: kill Fettgesicht. Somewhere in 2001, sushi released a 10-map version 1.0 and a 15-map final version of his mod called The Third Reich. Story: kill Schabbs. You also get some new graphics in the package, with various amounts of neatness, though most of it seems to be familiar, vanilla-style stuff. Some at least I remember from Munchkinstein. As for mapping, what can I say? Tight, extensive, blocky, densely populated - I guess these adjectives fit best, as is often the case with Mac scenarios. While certain places and even entire levels stand out of the crowd, in general you are likely ready for what you're about to see. Remember, 15 maps. Well, or 10, since both versions are included with the release. Still, can't resist that.

sushi, who can be messaged at bmoore (at) olympus.net, but will he write back? Of somewhat more interest is his personal website at http://www.olympus.net/personal/bmoore/ which can be still found, in part, on archive org... Happy browsing.
