> No endscreen, story and highscores.
Also episode screen and intermission graphics have their palettes converted and lose some details.

> Enemies have only front graphics and target player only at < 8 tiles.
> Gun fire won't do any damage if the player somehow manages to go from < 8 tiles to 16 tiles distance before the shot happens.
> Enemies have low chance (doubled on higher difficulty) of shooting up until 4 tiles to the player.
> Enemies at < 4 tiles enter endless loop of shooting where they skip first walking frame while moving few pixels.
> Enemies don't see the player at 16 tiles and beyond.

> 640x480 resolution is basically 640x400 without black frame around and statusbar moved down.
No extra resolution details. Also 512x384, 640x480 make it look like you can't get as close to enemies
due to the weapon and statusbar being pushed down.

> Less assets but higher definition and many things being simplified.

> No damage flash because someone thoughts it's a great idea to stare into BJ's eyes.

> Enemies can't open locked doors in 3rd Encounter.

> Projectile Weapons
First Encounter only has via cheat. In 2nd Encounter projectiles are blocked by all solid objects.
3rd Encounter lets them pass through statobjects except for columns and cages.


====================== BUGS/GLITCHES

> STRAFING
strafing right + strafing left  = strafe left + turn right
strafing right 	+ turn right 	= strafe right (no strafe turning)
strafing left 	+ turn left 	= strafe left (no strafe turning)
strafing left  	+ turn right 	= strafe left + turn right
strafing right  + turn left 	= strafe right + turn right (wrong direction)

> Vacuum Pushwall ghost spot
Blocks targeting of enemies. They forgot to remove nosight flag. 1st/2nd Encounter only.

> Minor things that 3rd Encounter fixed.

> Pick ups inside walls
Can be picked up.

> Pick ups radius
They can be picked up over diagonal tile length.

> Enemies inside walls
Don't react to player until they get hit by a projectile.

> Invisible Pushwalls
Pushwalls can be only seen from one direction.

> Sprites clipping
over walls if behind walls at > 10 tile distance.

> Sprites clipping at certain angles
Sprites have aren't nailed well to the center of the tile. Big sprites can clip into walls
when player turns away from them in extreme angels.

> Partial walls 
BSP exploit of editor or incomplete. Enemies don't see the player and shots don't go through.

> Killing final boss and leaving room won't trigger the victory cam until player returns.

> Ratio Crash
Game crashes if there is no treasure, secret or enemy on the map due to intermission ratios
dividing by the total stat of any of those.

> Missing Ubermutant attack frame and Hitler sound.

> Walls look cut off on some corners. BSP or scaling issue?

> Sprites can have every few pixel columns being offbeat.

> Talking Dogs
Very small chance of weapon doing damage = 0 but dogs can yell in human voice if they got hit
since they have only 1 hitpoint.

> Player clipping
If player movement is really high using mouse it is possible to clip out of a wall if
player start position is on this wall. Max speed is tileglobal-1. Also possible to very rarely clip
at high speed diagonally through objects or into the meeting point of 2 walls.

> Max Actor Limit
Limit is 128 and lower than the 150 in the DOS version. Third Encounter levels E2L8, E4L8, E6L1, 
E6L7, and E6L10 exceed that. Game doesn't crash and stops spawning enemies towards the bottom 
right corner of the map.

> Max Static Objects Limit
Limit is 200 for the 1st, 2nd Encounter and (around) 400 for the 3rd Encounter. 
Like enemies any over the limit won't spawn. The max of 200 results in some watered down rooms.
