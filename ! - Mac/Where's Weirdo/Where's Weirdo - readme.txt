Who's Weirdo, you may ask? A better question would be, Where's Weirdo? This 10-floor Third Encounter mod is a late offering of WolfAddict, but there's not a lot of info available about it. They simply tell you to reconsider whether or not you really want to meet the guy; to be honest, he looks a bit unstable. I didn't even get to know what the price was, as the WolfAddict catalogue I have did not include any ordering info, merely asking you to contact them if you're interested in buying anything. But before you buy it, you might want to try it, and that's where the demo comes in... Two demos, even, and they're both reproduced here (the so-called "W2 Demo" is meant to be the Second Encounter demo, but it's a Third Encounter scenario file; go figure). The demos have some small mapping and graphical differences between themselves, but ultimately both feature three maps along with a small number of new graphics, including one enemy (guess who). The full 10-level version has slightly different decorative sprites and introduces a rather convoluted system of secret exits between maps. On the other hand... there's no Weirdo, as the enemy sprites were deleted for some mind-boggling reason. Add to that the fact that level 1 is a tiny stub and another map is just an edit of a commercial floor (odd thing to have in a paid mod), and we have to conclude that while it still offers interesting mapping in some spots, all in all, Where's Weirdo? is a confusing release, and rather underwhelming considering that you had to pay for it. See for yourself, it's right here...
