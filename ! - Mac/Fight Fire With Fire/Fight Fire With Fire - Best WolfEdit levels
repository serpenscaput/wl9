Hey, Wolfenstein Addicts!This is a text file of the best WolfEdit levels I have downloaded. I haven't downloaded ALL of them by a long shot (hey, whaddaya think--I haven't got ANY life???) but I have downloaded and played at least fifty, so I can make at least a few recommendations. The levels I recommend have several elements in common:1. Fast-paced. No long hallways that lead nowhere. No more doors to push thru than necessary. Few dead-ends. You should be able to move through the whole level without passing through the same area twice.2. Few obvious mistakes like doors that slide into nothingness, secret panels that change color after they're pushed on (or don't work), solid objects that pass through other solid objects, etc. etc. etc.3. Unique. Something that sets it apart from 99% of the other WolfEdit Levels on AOL.4. And most important: NOT STINGY WITH THE BOSSES!Some of these levels have a few mistakes, but are included anyway because of some good features. I'm not guaranteeing that everyone will agree with my picks, but if you liked my levels, chances are you'll like the ones I recommend, too. First I give the titles, then the name of the creator/uploader (if I know it), then a few comments.BEST 1ST ENCOUNTER LEVELSThe creme de la creme:****NAZI ARENA****   by JAY 888Imaginative and highly original level in which you start out in the center of a huge room surrounded by blue guys.
