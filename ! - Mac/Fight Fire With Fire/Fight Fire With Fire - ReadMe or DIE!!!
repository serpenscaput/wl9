Hey, Wolfenstein Addicts!If you enjoy playing WolfEdit levels, prepare for the ride of your life!!! Here are three unique and highly exciting levels of pulse-pounding, non-stop action for Wolfenstein 2nd Encounter! "Yeah, yeah, I've heard that hype before." Well, this time, it's true! From the minute you start this game, you will be plunged into action that doesn't stop until you pull the switch on the very last level. I promise!There are no dead-ends, no unnecessary doors to push thru--no lulls in the action--anywhere. Best of all, you get to kill Hitler not once, but twice! The unique thing about these levels is that every game plays differently. It all depends on how the enemies decide to come at you!In the first level, you will be caught in the center of it all from the moment you open the very first door. Don't stay in the first room too long or you're a goner!In the second level, prepare to meet every boss in the book! Don't try to hide from them. They will come after you until only one of you is left (hence the name of the game).The third level is like the second, only harder!  If you like bosses, you'll LOVE these levels! I suggest you play all of these levels at the easiest skill setting at least the first few times. (Yes, there is enough ammo to get thru all three levels--if you play well. And, yes, all the levels are winnable.)NOTE: If you find you are getting invisible enemies in the first level, try playing at the smallest screen size. If you don't like doing that, you can reduce the number of enemies in the first level in WolfEdit, although I think you'll find it's worth putting up with an occasional invisible enemy for the intense level of excitement you get on this floor. (Okay, so it isn't perfect! What do you want, your money back???)IF YOU LIKED THIS, BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD MY OTHER ORIGINAL WOLFENSTEIN LEVEL FOR 2ND ENC., “FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE!!!!”Let me know how you like these levels.____________________________________________________________________(You only need to read this if you've never played a WolfEdit level before)How to Download and play Wolf-Edit GamesFirst of all, you must have Wolfenstein 1st Encounter (Shareware version) or 2nd Encounter (commercial version).  Secondly, you must have WolfEdit.  WolfEdit is a free program that allows you to make your own Wolf levels or play other people’s scenarios.To get WolfEdit, log onto America Online, select "Search Software Libraries" from the GO TO menu and type WOLFEDIT in the subject box.  The list that comes up will list "WolfEdit 1.1." Download it. You can find WolfEdit scenarios by searching keyword WOLFENSTEIN in "Search Software Libraries". A WolfEdit Scenario, once downloaded, has a modified Wolfenstein "saved game" icon, with a picture of B.J. Blaskowicz’s (or whatever his name is) head over a “sheet of paper” with a multi-colored border around it.  (The multi-colored border may not show up if you have not rebuilt your desktop recently.) Some people have tried to upload their WolfEdit creations as saved games. These have the face over a regular document icon with lines on it.  THESE WILL NOT WORK! Double-clicking on those will just launch the original Wolfenstein, or whatever WolfEdit game you played last.Anyway, once you have a WolfEdit scenario, double-click on it.  WolfEdit should launch automatically.  A little window listing the levels in that scenario will come up. If you want to examine one of the levels first, double-click on its name.To install the level in Wolfenstein, first make a COPY of Wolfenstein by selecting it and choosing “Duplicate” from the Desktop’s FILE menu. Lock the original copy of Wolfenstein for safety.With the Wolfedit scenario you want to install open and selected, choose “Install” from WolfEdit’s FILE menu. In the dialog box, navigate to the COPY of Wolfenstein.  Select it, then click “Install.”Quit WolfEdit, then double-click on the copy of Wolfenstein you made.  The new scenario you installed should start up.WolfEdit comes with a 2nd encounter extension that will allow it to work with both Wolfenstein 1st and 2nd Encounters, with all the enemies and most of the textures.However, you must have Wolfenstein 2nd Encounter to play 2nd Encounter scenarios. To play a 2nd Encounter scenario, you must install it into a copy of Wolfenstein 2nd encounter. For maximum fun with WolfEdit, be sure to purchase 2nd Encounter from MacPlay so you can play and make 2nd Encounter WolfEdit scenarios too! Buying 2nd Encounter will allow you to fight all-new enemies and encourage MacPlay and other companies to continue making great Mac games!Have fun!Cyber 1999@AOL.COM
