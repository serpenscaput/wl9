								Episode 2: Operation UberfaustMexican secret Forces of the 245th Mexican Battallion stationed 25 miles off Berlin under American-Mexican coalition inform you that the person you killed before was a clone of Doctor Shaabs, and that he had fooled you by creating poor duplicates of the Mutant Army, making it possible for you to think you've won. Surprise, Surprise!!!!! He's more alive than dead, the time it took you to kill his clone was enough for him to make false copies of his journals and equipment then laid them right in front of you before his clone gasped his last breath. After you left he went back to his research and he created more powerful Mutants with chainguns instead of regular pistols, these were created with a little DNA from Trans Grosse (Hans's brother) and made prototype soldiers to guard the castle (the Uber-Mutants). And to top it off perfectly, Trans was sent by Der Fuerher himself to supervise and aid Dr. Shaabs on his maniacal accomplishments. He too must die, only leaving Gretel to kill. "Your Mission Captain Blazcowicz, is to penetrate the castle and destroy these abonminable creatures, Trans Grosse and the evil Doctor before his Ubermutants wriek havoc on the frontlines.
