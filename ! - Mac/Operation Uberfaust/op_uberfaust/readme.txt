Number five (is alive)! Operation Uberfaust, ten Third Encounter maps by God knows who (once again there's a readme but the author never bothers telling us his name). We are given a pretty elaborate storyline. Remember back when you killed doctor "Shaabs" and his army of mutants back in Episode 2? Well, the Mexican secret forces (?) have got news for you: the doc was just a clone and his mutants - shitty duplicates. In short, you got bamboozled. The real Schabbs is back at Hollehammer, this time surrounded by the real deal - Ubermutants, mighty, armed to the teeth, infused with Trans Grosse's DNA. No worries though, a Mexican (?) B-24 Liberator bomber is going to take you to the place and drop you so you can actually do your damn job.

If this sounds exciting, prepare to be let down, as there are no new graphics or sounds and the maps are actually vanilla Episode 2 maps with some Ubermutants thrown in here and there. But hey, at least the storyline is funney.
