Doors revised(3 Levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis scenario was made in my earlier years just for the fun of making levels and brushing up my editing skills. The levels here were all made from scratch by myself. It was supposed to become a more prolonged scenario but it didn't. The main reason was because that after I changed computers this scenario started to experience severe difficulties with the PowerPC problem. Hence, I abandonned the scenario. The "revised" means that I slightly improved it to soften the PowerPC Problem, but still it's not in its best. I suggest people who are afraid to freeze their Macs should avoid playing this scenario.This scenario is designed for play with the 1st and 2nd Encounter applications only, so don't play with it on the 3rd Encounter. It won't crash your computer or anything but it might become a nightmare!Some things you'd better know about before playing this scenario is the "magical sweetspot bug" and the "corner-shooting technique". Most of you would think that some of these levels are impossible to clear, unless you knew about these tips. I've written about it in detail in my website. It's in the Ultra-Tips corner, so check it out!CopyrightsIf you do something with this scenario, just give me credit, and everything else is yours!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
