Auf Wiedersehen, Adolf!

Not only have Allied intelligence agents discovered the location of a new top secret Nazi installation, they've also learned that Hitler himself is going to be giving a speech there. So they send you on a very important mission: to assassinate the top Nazi himself.
You reach the installation, get in through the basement and fight your way to the ground floor. But when you reach the huge conference room, there's no sign of Hitler. He's escaped! And so begins a wild goose chase that takes you through a maze of underground tunnels, back out into the street, through various neighborhood buildings, and down into another network of tunnels that ultimately leads to Hitler's hideout. And all along the way. you encounter dozens of Hitler's goons at every turn... and even a few Hitler look-alikes. Will you survive long enough to finally reach the Fuhrer himself and get the chance to say “Auf Wiedersehen, Adolf!”?
