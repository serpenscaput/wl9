Caesar's Maps by (presumably) Caesar: 10 floors for the First Encounter. This is the oldest Mac Wolf scenario by a margin of over a couple thousand years. Unfortunately, as you will no doubt see, Caesar was a much better civic and military leader than he was an architect. These levels often consist of a giant open space with enemies strewn haphazardly around. There are some exceptions, though, and you might find some enjoyment in these, you never know. Give it a try regardless.
