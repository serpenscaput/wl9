Hot on Your Trail (yes, that's today's theme) is a three-map scenario by Joel Brown. I can never remember if there's any relation to another mainstay of Mac modding, Ian Brown. With no accompanying readme, we can only guess. The mod incorporates a lot of Amerika the Beautiful graphics without throwing dozens of SS at you from the word go. Maps are small, but meaty, with lots of combat among tightly packed space (now where have we heard this song before?) Still, the whole thing feels like it's unfinished, as possibly indicated by the improperly shaded wall textures.
