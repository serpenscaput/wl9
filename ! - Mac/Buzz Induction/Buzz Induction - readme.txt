Buzz Induction is a First Encounter release toting three brand new floors. Unlike many Mac sets, this one does not flood you with guards, instead slowly ramping the difficulty up in each of the first two maps. And then you face the boss and it's over. I don't know anything else about this scenario: who made it, what's the story, why the rather unique title, nada. You gotta enjoy it for what it is.

Buzz off.
