NOTE: Disregard the e-mail address. It no longer exists. (3/14/99)---Thank you for downloading the Compact Maps! These maps are one-level map sets of the first versions of the maps that would become part of Castle Xeen, the 40-level behemoth which was also written by me. Please note that some of the secret doors may not work in these first-versions. All but one of these maps are in WolfEdit format. The one that isn't in WolfEdit format is Castle Burlock.Contents: Requirements, Resemblements, Notice, Getting Started for the WolfEdit Maps, Getting Started for Castle Burlock, Mail Me!, Other Maps Available, Upcoming Maps, And Also...Requirements:ResEditWolfEdit 1.1B (actually, it's optional)A Color Macintosh with 68LC040 processor or higherWolfenstein 3D 2nd or 3rd Encounter (but not 1st)Experience with Wolfenstein 3DStuffit Expander (if you get the .sit version)Resemblements:Castle Burlock resembles floor 1-1 or Castle Xeen, What a Yough MAP! resembles floor 1-3, The Jails resembles floor 2-1, and Mission Whacko resembles floor 1-2.NOTICE!!!The compact maps are for the Macintosh only!

That's the only other one available. But, soon, there will be more. Castle Xeen is 39 levels and the Mega-Trainer Demo is 8 levels.Upcoming Maps:Mega-Trainer is on the way. It will be about as big a Castle Xeen (40 levels). It is intended for Wolfenstein novices, but Wolfenstein Experts will find it a big treat! Also, look out for other Compact Maps of 3 levels.And Also...I'm looking for Doom II WAD files and a Doom II map editor so I can make a Doom II version of Castle Xeen. But, meanwhile, you can copy this public-domain software and change it with WolfEdit! Mail me altered versions of these compact maps! Mail me Bolo maps, Colonization, Civilization, World of Xeen, and The Legend of Kyrandia Book 3: Malcolm's Revenge saves, too! Let me know once you find BoloStar 2.0 or the Doom II map editor with their ftp sites. Good luck!
