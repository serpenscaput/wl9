OK, so a while ago I had posted Compact Maps, a series of sets several maps each, fairly small in size. Well, I made a mistake back then, and what I thought was Compact Maps 1 was actually Compact Maps 1 for the First Encounter, a separate entity. I'm here to correct this mistake today. Compact Maps 1 contains four (technically five, but one is a non-functional stub) maps, each of which is an early version of a later Castle Xeen level. To quote the readme, "Castle Burlock resembles floor 1-1 or Castle Xeen, What a Yough MAP! resembles floor 1-3, The Jails resembles floor 2-1, and Mission Whacko resembles floor 1-2.". Some of these floors aren't actually that compact, but elbow room is still scarce as you are assailed by absurd numbers of enemies. Sorry for the confusion and have fun.===CREDITS===Josh Mills.
