The Phriggian Era POC is a 15-map Third Encounter scenario by Dermuda. The Phriggian Era is an unfinished scenario meant to be the second part of a four-mod series initiated with Crimson Kahnage. Obviously, the plans never fully materialized (after all, POC stands for Proof Of Concept). New wall textures are included, based on graphics from games such as Myst and a port of Ultima III. Dermuda describes his mapping style as "playful", and many of the later floors exhibit heavy symmetry similar to Laz Rojas' works. 

As for the plot: while the main character, Alan Hollbrooks, had killed Khan in the first game, his death was but another chapter of the long war between the Krimni and Layphids. Khan's death triggered a failsafe device that enveloped the nearby environs in a statis field, trapping every organism inside in suspended animation. Khan's successor chose not to revive anyone trapped inside the field, thus leaving Hollbrooks to remain frozen for ages. Fast forward some centuries and we see the Krimni finally lose the war. The Layphids took control of former Krimni colonies, including Earth, which was to be converted into a world-spanning city. More centuries pass and Alan Hollbrooks finally wakes up from his long cryogenic sleep. Seeing the Earth terraformed into a giant city, he sets out to inflict as much damage as possible on its newly found conquerors.
