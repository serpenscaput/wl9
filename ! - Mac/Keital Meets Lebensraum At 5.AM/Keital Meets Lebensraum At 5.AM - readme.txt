Peck, peck, pecking at the bark of Mac scenarios... Wait, I'm a duck, not a woodpecker. Never mind then.

Keitel Meets Lebensraum At 6am is a flippantly named scenario by Richar D. Peck. This time RDP focuses on one-tile narrow passages. Very long ones for the most part. With enemies both actively pursuing you or lying in ambushes. Resources are generally behind secrets, as are keys (if any). That's all you need to know, now go and kill some Germans.
