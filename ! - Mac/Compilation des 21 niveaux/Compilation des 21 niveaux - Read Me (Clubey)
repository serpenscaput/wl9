compilation des 21 niveauxJean-Sebastien Rimmel (20 levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 1st Encounter, and was made by Jean-Sebastien Rimmel. The translation for the title is "compilation of 21 levels". I wonder why he calls it so when it has only 20 levels. Strange...I slightly revised these levels because the author tended to leave the guard, secret and treasure at the bottom-right corner of his level design intact. I took them out and put in a crown or a secret right at the end of the level if necessary. However, basically, levels made by this author can be stated as of high quality, so I believe most of you would have fun playing them.I know nothing about this author besides the fact that he made the following scenarios and that he's French :compilation des 21 niveaux, compilation des 10 niveaux, dure 001-005, Grands Concours 1st, mon niveau pour le concour, niveau de fin 00001, simple 01-05, ultra dure 0001-0005, and ultra simple 1-5. If you know anything about this author or of any other scenario of his, please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpCopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
