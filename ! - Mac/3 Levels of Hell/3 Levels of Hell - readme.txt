3 Levels of Hell is a First Encounter scenario created by RickC14. The three maps are all reasonably large and not quite as intense on enemies as many other mapsets. There's even a reference to the almighty Burger somewhere in there, although you probably won't spot it without looking at the map top-down. All in all, an OK effort.
