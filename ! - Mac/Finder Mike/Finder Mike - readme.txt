Find, found, found... Sorry, just practicing my grammar.

Finder Mike, oh, Finder Mike. Made by Bruce Ryder and Beau Ondrusek (yeah, right), Finder Mike is an 8-level scenario for the Second Encounter. Storyline: you're the granchild of B. J. Blazkowicz, Micheal F. "Finder Mike". Your status in the Delta Force has landed you an assignment: infiltrate enemy lines and gather information for Operation Desert Storm. However, the famous Blazkowicz incompetence in all things stealth strikes again, and so you're captured and placed in Hotel Hussein. Time to escape and do what you do best: blast everything to pieces.

Finder Mike is an odd beast. Even though it's marketed as the inaugural effort of nascent level design star, the aforementioned Beau Ondrusek, six out of eight maps in this mod were created in WolfMaker, only a couple of them bearing some further edits. The remaining two maps are decent, but not revolutionary. There's also a couple interesting desing decisions: for example, the penultimate map does not seem to feature an elevator tile or Hitler. New graphics are limited to several textures hailing from the PC version, plus some sprites featuring a similar role. Definitely an odd bird among Mac scenarios.
