Winchester 22 is a scenario for the Third Encounter made by Mike John. You've been imprisoned for a year now, living large on a steady, filling diet of dog food. During your imprisonment you've often heard guards spreading rumors about Hitler's secret Revenge Weapon, powerful enough to push the western Allies back into the English Channel. Determined to prevent its deployment, you bide your time until a huge party in the castle makes discipline rather lax. It's time to break out, but first you will be spiritually visited by your grandfather's grandfather who gives you your old, trusty Winchester 22 rifle. In fact, you'll be finding Winchesters all over the place throughout the 15 maps of this mod. You will also meet a lot of strange new enemies (lots of regular guards and plenty of bosses alike) and face a whole bunch of gameplay tricks. Some new graphics come from Laz Rojas and Clubey, but others are custom made for this scenario. As for mapping, there's a ton of convoluted rooms and hallways, with areas made to challenge and confuse the player, certainly not with any sort of realism or aesthetic values in mind. After a few floors you'll be familair with most of the mapping tricks used here, but that does not reduce the overall challenge level. Be warned.
