This scenario may be played with 2nd or 3rd encounter, however it's only been play tested with the 3rd encounter. This scenario may be sent worldwide provided all three files are kept together. Anyone can gladly borrow any of MY graphics, but please ask first in case I myself happened to have borrowed them myself. Plus it would be nice to be given credit.
  Thanks go to Laz and Clubey for allowing me to borrow some graphics and for their help and advice via email. Also to Greg Ewing for Wolfedit.
