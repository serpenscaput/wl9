Wolfenmania 1.0 /Wolfenmania Death Version(15 levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis scenario was made in my earlier years just for the fun of making levels and brushing up my editing skills. Actually, it was my first long scenario. Most of the levels I made from scratch, and some I borrowed from others. I don't remember whose levels I used as the basis to work on. If anyone thinks he/she should receive credit for any level in this scenario, you've got it! Just email me.The death version is only a slightly moderated version of the 1.0 version. It's supposed to be a bit harder.CopyrightsIf you do something with this scenario, just give me credit, and everything else is yours!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
