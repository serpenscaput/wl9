Wolfenmania is a 15-level First Encounter scenario by Clubey. It comes in two versions: the basic 1.0, and the so-called Death Version which is a bit harder, but otherwise identical. Some maps were made from scratch, while others were borrowed from various sources and edited; unfortunately Clubey does not remember who originally made the latter. Either way, in most cases the maps display the usual hallmarks of Clubey's map design: they're extremely crowded by enemies, with close quarters and blocking objects regulating the tempo of combat. There's no storyline here, just go in and shoot things.
