The second maze mod is literally called Maze, nothing more, nothing less. It's a single, fairly robust map for Third Encounter that only partially lives up to its name. The most interesting thing about it though, it's actually our first mod for a mod. Maze is a map made for Strangestein and using all of Strangestein's resources. Funney stuff. Makes me wonder if there are many more such cases.

Don't know. Strangestein was made by George Rodriguez, but Maze does not come with any names attached, so I can't tell if it was really him who made it.
