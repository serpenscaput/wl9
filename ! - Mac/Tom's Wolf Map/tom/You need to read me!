Then using Wolfedit (avaliable on this same archive,  It is a really great program) install (comand-I) it into the copy of Wolfenstien™.I have encountered a few quirks involving the map.  Sometimes the secretdoors will show different even when I don’t want them to.  The second isthe problem with invisible enemies.  Don’t know how or why it happens,but sometimes it does.  Once every blue moon, it won’t advance you to thenext level.  When this happens, type “mccall”.  Another way to cheat is to use the WolfenCheat extension available on this archive.  If anyone can help me withmy problem, please e-mail me!This is a fairly hard level to beat.  I suggest novices not playing. Intermediates should like the second level of difficulty.  People withmicrochips for brains should run on the “Death Incarnate” level, and no oneelse (I sometimes exaggurate).  If difficulty still persists, obtain the "Wolfencheat" extension.  If you still can't beat it while cheating, you need help.P.S.  There is a boss in the first level, but you don’t need the key.  Becareful!  In the second level,  I swear there is an exit!  Mabye it would helpto look at your map.  In the third level, the phrase to remember is “don’tstop running!”Sincerely,Tom Williford
