Hello. You have gonorrhea. But don't worry, we'll cure you all right...

What's going on? Well, there's this lab in Leipzig where the finest scientists and medical doctors in the Third Reich are about to gather for a conference. You see, the ban on eugenics research, introduced by President Hindenburg, is no longer in force. Seizing this opportunity, Hitler wants to push Dr. Schabbs' mutant soldier project towards completion, as new troops are urgently needed for the European theaters of war. Due to its importance, the conference will be heavily guarded with regular soldiers and mutants alike. And don't worry, the scientists themselves have a few tricks up their sleeves...

Doctor's Conference is a Third Encounter scenario by Ian Brown. 20 maps and a slew of new graphics (both custom made and borrowed - see the readme for a partial credits list) all await your hungry eyes. If you've played any Ian Brown mods before, you'll know that the graphics maintain a pretty high standard. 

You will, rather fittingly, mostly find yourself fighting in clean (not for long) white and brown-white environments as the locales vary from cozy office spaces to laboratory walls. You often get to peek outside (it's the deep of the night in Lepizig) or are teased by pickups that cannot be reached without the noclip cheat. Level designs are elaborate and tight, as usual with Mac mods. They maintain a consistent quality and mapping style, perhaps with a couple oddballs (see levels 4 and 10). Guard population appears to be the highest in early maps, especially floor 1, and drops off a bit in later levels in favor of multiple bosses per map. All in all, if you like Ian Brown scenarios, you're going to enjoy this one as well. 

Thanks to JMC for recommending this mod.
