WHAT IS BREAKTHROUGH 2: HIDEAWAY?Breakthrough 2: Hideaway (B2) is a new scenario for the popular Wolfenstein 3Dª gaming engine (Wolf3d).  It is similar to the other scenarios that can be found online or ordered through WolfAddict Software, Inc (WolfAddict) in the fact that it contains new levels.  However, B2 breaks many of the barriers that made other level sets predictable or repetitive.  How?  Keep reading for the answer.2. WHY SHOULD I BE INTERESTED IN BREAKTHROUGH 2?B2 contains many new features that you won't find in traditional "homebrew" levels, such as others you can download from AOL.  The same graphics, music, and patterns are no more.  When you first play B2, you'll be stuck in a 56-level Nazi compound like no other.  To find all of the differences and features, you'll have to play through all the way to the end(s).3. WHAT NEW FEATURES EXIST IN BREAKTHROUGH 2, AND WHY IS IT BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL?Here is a partial listing of what's new in B2:- All-new artwork: you'll never see another boring blue wall!- Invisible walls: try navigating through a maze when you're blind!- Fake enemies: guards that look real but only are there to confuse you!- New sounds: Commercial and 1st Enc. Wolf3d players get new sounds in most places!- Multiple Game Paths: By far, B2's best feature!4. WHAT'S THIS THING ABOUT "MULTIPLE GAME PATHS?"At many points in B2, you'll encounter a sign saying, "Select Route."  The direction you take will affect the outcome of the game, as it will determine which level you proceed to next!  This also means that you will only see 24-34 of the 56 levels as you play.  Therefore, you have to go back and play again to see the ones you missed!  Mix and match; B2's a different game every time you play!  On top of this, there are secret levels in every zone, and an entire 4-level secret zone: the elusive Zone 9!  In order to see all of the levels, and all 5 ending levels, you'll have to play through the entire game 6 TIMES!  Now THAT'S VALUE!5. HOW MANY TOTAL PATH COMBINATIONS EXIST IN B2?I can seriously tell you that there are a total of 51,840 different ways to finish B2, none of them alike!  If you need proof, see below:How many different ways are there to complete:Zone 1?	3Zone 2?	4Zone 3?	3Zone 4?	5Zone 5?	6Zone 6?	4Zone 7?	2Zone 8?	3Zone 9?	23 x 4 x 3 x 5 x 6 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 = 51,840 !!!I would give you even better proof, but I can't do so without revealing entrances to secret levels and the secret zone!6. HOW CAN I ORDER B2, WHAT VERSION OF WOLF IS IT FOR, AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?Breakthrough 2: Hideaway is available exclusively through WolfAddict Software.  It will be playable on ANY version of Wolf (Commercial, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Encounters) although some aspects of the game will be slightly different on different platforms.  It will cost $8 US. (plus $2 US shipping if you order by disk and snail mail)  If this seems too expensive, consider the fact that it's a different game every time you play.  If it still seems too steep, you can tell me what you think it's worth after you've played the demo or the shareware version!Many have already asked me how to order B2, or haven't been able to find a catalog.  For that reason, I'm going to make it a bit easier to order B2.Mail a 3x5 index card, sheet of paper, or anything that can be written on to:WolfAddict SoftwareRR#1 Box 80-5Greene, NY 13778-9630On the index card, please give (and label the information):Your nameYour FULL addressYour e-mail address (if you have one)Whether or not this is your first WolfAddict orderWhich encounter of Wolf3d you have (First, Second, or Third.  If you have the commercial version, or a version that doesn't tell you which encounter, put down Third.)Whether or not you would like B2 sent by e-mailIf you do NOT want B2 sent by e-mail, or if you don't know how to receive files by e-mail, add $2 US for shipping and handling.  You may pay by cash, money order or check.  If you pay by check, allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EXTRAS?Breakthrough was a fantastic 32-level extravaganza.  But we also threw in tons of extras with it, and we aren't this time.  Why not?  Consider the fact that B2 is 56 levels, and think about the time it takes to perfect 56 levels, and you'll know why.  If you're a Wolf fanatic and need more of a challenge, just try and beat all 56 levels!  If that still isn't enough, a follow-up scenario to B2 will be available in a few months.  It will contain more of the multiple path mayhem that made B2 so spectacular.  Registered B2 players will be able to get it for practically nothing; others will pay about $5.8.  CAN I HAVE SOME STATISTICS FOR B2?All right, here are some statistics:B2 consists of 56 levels.  It will have 14 secret levels, including secret Zone 9, which is 4 levels long.  There are a total of 11 places in the game where you will have to choose a path, not including secret level entrances.  There are 5 different ending levels, spread over three zones (including Zone 9).  In case you haven't guessed by now, the levels are divided up into zones, of which there are 9.  In Zone 6, your choice of paths determines whether you wind up in Zone 7 or 8, where you will finish the game (or maybe not....).  You will have to play through the entire game AT LEAST SIX TIMES to find all of the 56 levels!!  B2 is AVAILABLE NOW, costs $8 US and can be ordered through WolfAddict's catalog or by sending in a form like the one above in item #6.  You can obtain a copy of the catalog by downloading the latest version off of AOL, or by visiting WolfAddict's Web page at http://users.aol.com/ruebenryd/ruebenryd.htmlThe Web page also contains new WolfAddict demos and explanations of new products, as well as links to some other cool pages.9. WHERE DOES THE PATH SPLIT, AND WHERE ARE THE ENDINGS?So you want some tips, do you?  All right, here are the locations of major path splits throughout B2's 56 levels.  These splits do NOT include secret levels or the secret zone.1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, 4-1, 4-2, 4-6, 5-4, 6-1, and 8-1.The endings that can be obtained WITHOUT finding secrets are located in:7-4, 8-3, and 8-4.There are a total of FIVE ending levels, however, and one is located in the secret zone.  Keep searching!!10. WHY CAN'T I FIND ALL OF THE ZONES/ENDINGS?Here's one major reason: level 6-1.  The path you take in 6-1 determines whether you proceed to Zone 7 or Zone 8.  Also, all of the secrets in B2 are hinted in some way, although it may not be so obvious.  Look for a row of lights, treasures or other objects; an object or wall out of place; a different type of wall in some areas; something in the shape of an arrow.  If you get lost in a maze, try using the Automap (press /).  This can also help you find some secrets!  One last tip: map out the game as you play.  I designed the game by using a map, and if you're a good enough player, you'll be able to re-create my map!  On the other hand, if you're absolutely clueless, wait a few weeks until the B2 Spoiler Guide is released.11. WHERE'S THE ENTRANCE TO THE SECRET ZONE?You expect me to tell you!?  I'll give you one hint: it's somewhere in the game!  Actually, there's a hint in item #8, just above, but that's the ONLY hint you're getting until the B2 Spoiler Guide comes out.  If you're lucky enough to find it, congratulations .... and get ready for the TOUGHEST set of levels you've EVER played!  You'll also want to visit the Secret Zone at least twice... the path splits in its first level!!12. I THINK I'VE MASTERED B2!  IS THERE ANYTHING I MISSED, AND WHAT'S NEXT?Check your level map.  Make sure there are 56 levels listed.  Play through a 34-level path (the longest in the game, and one you'll know if you've truly mastered B2) on the hardest difficulty level achieving90% or better kills75% or better secrets75% or better treasureson every level.  Do NOT save at ALL!  If you can complete B2 like this, finishing on level 9-4, you have truly mastered the game!What's next?  I'll tell you.See item #7 for info on the Mini-Episode.  If we receive 50 registrations or more for Breakthrough 2: Hideaway, I will produce a Breakthrough 3!
