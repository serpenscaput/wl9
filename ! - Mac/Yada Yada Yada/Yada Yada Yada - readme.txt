OK now. Truth be told, I wanted to port something, but I just finished an unrelated project and I'm too exhausted to do anything major. So I compromised and prepared a small release. Thas is...

Yada Yada Yada, one map for the Third Encounter by an unknown author. I'm afraid that even the required two screenshots will be too much of a spoiler, as it's a short level. You'll be facing a ridiculous number of enemies, but you get enough ammo (probably) to face them all.
