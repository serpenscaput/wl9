Hot on the Trailby Jan Patters(5 levels for the 2nd Encounter)Some StuffThis level is designed for use with the 2nd Encounter, and was made by Jan Patters.I know nothing about this author besides that he has created, "Hot on theTrail". I have seen some people refer to this scenario as "Hot on Trail", but I can't tell which one is right.Any information concerning Jan Patters and this person's scenarios will be very much welcome at:clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpCopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
