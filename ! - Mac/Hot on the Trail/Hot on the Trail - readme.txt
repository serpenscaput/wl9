Hot on the Trail is a five-map scenario by Jan Patters. A vanilla mapset, Hot on the Trail has to fall back on the merits of its mapping, and it so happens that they're decent... For the most part. Three interesting levels are followed by a rather uncanny slaughtermap, then another floor with perhaps a few bosses too many. Still worth a go.
