A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

...that's precisely what we bring for you today. Almost nothing is known about Gemini-BIC-Nazi Camp. It has three maps. The author might or might not be Patrick Ackerman. I don't even know if it's for the Second, or Third Encounter. There's no documentation, no storyline: I have no idea what does "Gemini" or "BIC" might stand for. There's a bunch of new graphics - all of them walls - but they don't exactly tell a coherent story. The scenario's lore is limited to its title and a single wall that says "Welcome to Camp IronFirst". Does it, then, have something to do with Operation Eisenfaust? But if so, why are there no Mutants? As you can see, this release is completely inscrutable. But that doesn't mean "unplayable". Give it a go.

Patrick Ackerman, maybe.
