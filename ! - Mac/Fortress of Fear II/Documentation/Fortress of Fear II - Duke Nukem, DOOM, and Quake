Duke Nukem, DOOM II, and QuakeWolfenstein 3Dª is an old, old game. While it is still played by millions of people, the game has certainly shown its age. New, more advanced games, such as DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D, and Quake have superseded it.Following the final release of Castle Wolfenstein (around April 1999), I will no longer make any more full-fledged, multi-level scenarios. Some Wolfenstein Adventures may pop up on Info-Mac every now and then, though. I've decided NOT to port Castle Wolfenstein to the more advanced DOOM, Duke Nukem, or Quake.However, if you are skilled at designing levels for any of these three games, it would be great if somebody volunteered to port my levels to another game.If you wish to volunteer, e-mail me at copperfield@worldnet.att.net and tell me which of my scenarios you wish to port to another game and which game you want to port it to. You will receive credit for creating the level. But, however, you MUST include in the Read Me file of the ported scenario that it was based on a Wolfenstein level by me.If you're eager enough to try porting one of my scenarios to another game, just e-mail me at the above address.Josh Millscopperfield@worldnet.att.nethttp://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/1634/index.htmlUpdated 4/10/99
