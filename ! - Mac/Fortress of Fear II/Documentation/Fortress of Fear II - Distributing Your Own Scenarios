Have a Wolfenstein scenario you want on the Net? Then read on!I post all of my Wolfenstein scenarios at Info-Mac. I send them to one address, and they get distributed all over the world. Here's how you do it:Step 1Stuff and BinHex your file using Stuffit or DropstuffªStep 2Attach the file to an e-mail message addressed tomacgifts@info-mac.orgStep 3In the subject line, put the name of the scenario. In the first line of the body, type "Please place in game/com/wolf" to make sure your scenario is placed where the other scenarios are.Under that, put the description of the scenario.That's it! Send it off. In about two weeks, your file should be in the archives! I've done a little digging around the Web, and I've found out that my scenarios can be downloaded from Australia, Austria, Canada, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, America, and the UK. I found it rather interesting.For more info on distributing your files, visit http://www.info-mac.comIf you know of another service similar to Info-Mac where you can submit Wolfenstein scenarios and other Macintosh files, e-mail me at copperfield@worldnet.att.net and tell me about it.Have a Wolfenstein scenario you want to be distributed in one of my packages? Read on!Until I get tired of doing it, I will be periodically releasing packages of scenarios to the public. If you want your scenario included, e-mail it to me, with or without a readme, at:copperfield@worldnet.att.netIf the scenario has a few flaws, I will fix them. If the scenario is seriously flawed, it will not be distributed. I'm not very picky on what I put in my packages. They just can't be buggy.
