Custom GraphicsI've searched far and wide for custom graphics. I've got all I can find, but I still want more custom graphics to make my levels more interesting.This is where you come in. If you're good at making graphics, you can create new enemies, walls, and objects for my scenarios. They must be 128 X 128 pixels long and wide, respectively.Also, you need to use a special color palette file, which I will send you if you volunteer. While I'm not expecting anybody to send me custom graphics, it would be great if somebody took the time to do it. Anybody who does it will receive a custom graphic credit in the readme of the scenario.E-mail any graphics to copperfield@worldnet.att.net
