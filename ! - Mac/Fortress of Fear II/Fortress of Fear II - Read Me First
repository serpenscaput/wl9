Fortress of FearFormerly Dragon CavernDescriptionFortress of Fear is a relatively easy scenario I created in 1996. It was my third scenario, following Castle Xeen and Castle of Lost Souls. It's about 25 levels long. While it's not perfect, it's still fun to play.Included is Fortress of Fear 2.0 and Fortress of Fear Enhanced 1.0b. The Enchanced version includes a few custom graphics. Also included is Tiger Cavern, a tiny First Encounter version of Fortress of Fear.Fortress of Fear requires the full version of Wolfenstein 3D. If you don't have Wolfenstein 3D, e-mail me at copperfield@worldnet.att.net. Tiger Cavern can be played with First Encounter by using the Wolf FKEY (included in the Extras).Original Readme included. Read for details. It's a little immature because I wrote it in 1996.Also included are the Extras. Double-click and dig in!How to InstallPut the scenarios you want to play into the "Levels" folder. Open Wolfenstein 3D. You'll see the name of the scenario. Select it and click OK.Josh Millscopperfield@worldnet.att.nethttp://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/1634/index.html
