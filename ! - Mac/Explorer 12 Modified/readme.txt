You are a denizen of the far future. And let me tell you one thing about the future: traversing the final frontier is mind-numbingly boring. Weeks and months of uneventful travel between stars would leave anyone on the brink of insanity. Today, however, was different. While carrying a load of weapons for a not-entirely-legal cause, you receive a distress signal. Following it, you reach a huge derelict base, the name "Explorer 12" emblazoned on its damaged hull. Curious, you land in the bay and notice skeletons, probably belonging to the former crew. You venture deeper inside - and then, without warning, a door slams shut behind you. It was a trap all along. Not one to panic easily, you equip your plasma pistol and prepare to take on whatever enemy might lurk in the confines of the derelict base.

Explorer 12 is a Third Encounter scenario made by Dermuda early in his modding career (in the year 1998). After Dermuda purchased his copy of WolfEdit 2, he made a bunch of trial scenarios, ranging from simple to very involved, and Explorer 12 was somewhere around the middle of this scale. There are two scenarios here, actually: Explorer 2 Demo (5 maps) and Explorer 2 Modified (1 map). With several levels, and graphics taken from Breakthrough 2 (demo) and Astrostein 3 (modified), it's a reasonable effort at scenario-making. You are going to visit various futuristic locales, look at the starry sky and urban landscapes, kill a couple dozen guards and a few bosses too. A decent piece of action. 

For some trivia: Dermuda tells me that while no full version of Explorer 12 exists, the scenario was basically finished under the guise of Crimson Kahnage floors 4 and 5. If you examine the Demo map 1, the only map of Explorer 12 Modified, and map 4-1 of Crimson Kahnage, you will notice that they are all variations on the same theme. What follows in these floors is an adaptation of the old plotline and overall idea, sort of resulting in a mod within a mod. Funney stuff!
