Of course it wouldn't be a MacenWolf mapset post without an unknown author somewhere in the mix. Achtung Zwei offers three levels for the First Encounter. The most interesting aspect of these maps is probably the death traps, meaning rooms filled with boss enemies whom you're obviously not meant to fight. Have fun running away from them, that is if you don't die instantly.
