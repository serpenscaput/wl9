Detach the form below (or leave this on if you're lazy, like me) and send it in an envelope with your payment to:																												Aaron Teplitsky																												174 Dahlia Drive																												Mahopac, NY 10541-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Check one of the following two choices:______ YES!  I'm convinced that RTW kicks butt and that I should be a good little boy/girl and pay you for all the long hours of work you put in.  I'm also convinced that $5 is really not outrageous for something as cool as this.  Thanks!  Send me my free Mini-Episodes by AOL E-mail.  Also send me Episodes 2 and 3 if they haven't been released on AOL yet.______ YES!  Same as above, but I don't (unfortunately) have an AOL address.  Therefore, I have provided for you not only a disk, but a stamped envelope in which to return it.  Yes, the envelope has to be big enough to hold the disk, obviously.  The disk itself can be double OR high density, although I might find extra stuff on it if it's the latter size.Now check one of the next two choices:______ I have enclosed a check/money order, payable to Aaron Teplitsky.______ I have enclosed cash, but I full well realize that you're not responsible if my money gets stolen in the mail and I wind up twiddling my thumbs while my best friend plays his FREE Mini-Episodes.My name is: ________________________________My AOL screen name is: __________________________On a scale of 1 to 10, I give what I have played of RTW a: ______________What have you played of RTW so far? _______________Would you like to see more of RTW in the future? _______________Questions/Comments go here: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Check here if you would like information on Wolfenstein 3D: Breakthrough as it is being developed.  You will be added to a special list and during development, you may be (e-)mailed levels for testing.  You will also be the first to play the finished game.  Breakthrough will be a 20-level game designed for First Encounter (because there are some people who will pay for absolutely nothing).  However, there will also be an enhanced, Second Encounter version of the game.  I plan to make it another cheap MaybeWare game, although if you paid for RTW I probably won't ask much (if anything) from you.I hope to begin work on this game by the end of May and have it done by the end of June.
