RTW 2.0-----Welcome to RTW (Return to Wolfenstein).  RTW was the first scenario I ever produced, and now I'm eager to share it with you.RTW consists of three 8-level episodes.  The ultimate objective is to destroy the Party of Five, a group of Nazi leaders run by Adolf Hitler.There are also three Mini-Episodes, included as a bonus.  Each is three levels and has a specific focus and story.  They're both fun and challenging.Version 1.0 required WolfEdit 1.1 and and Wolfenstein 3D Second Encounter to run.  2.0 does not require WolfEdit, and will run on any version except First Encounter.To run these levels, drop them in your Levels folder (if you have Wolf 3rd Encounter or the commercial version) or use the WolfFKEY (if you have 2nd Encounter).  Ignore all references to WolfEdit in the docs; WolfEdit is not required.The documentation was written awhile back (for version 1.0) so it might seem a little outdated.  For example, I talked about Breakthrough as a future, 20-level creation.  Meanwhile, it's been about a year since I released the 32-level Breakthrough, and Breakthrough 2 is 56 levels long!Ignore the "maybeware" references and order forms, they're outdated and RTW is freeware now.  Laugh at them.Above all, enjoy and Have Fun!AJT
