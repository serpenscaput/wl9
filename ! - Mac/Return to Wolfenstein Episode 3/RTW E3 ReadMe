RETURN TO WOLFENSTEIN, EPISODE THREE: PARTY OF FIVEBang!  Boom!  Ack!  More blast-em-up fun with Episode Three!  I just finished it and I'm pretty pleased with the results.  In terms of memory, it's not as big as Episode Two (the largest in the trilogy), but the battles are just a LITTLE harder.  And there's a LITTLE less health.  Note that LITTLE is capitalized....THE STORY SO FARThe Nazis have made a threat on your wallet!  After finishing Second Encounter, B.J. ReallylonglastnamethatIcan'tspell refused to pay $25 for the next game in the Wolfenstein trilogy.  The Nazis, displeased with the fact that they wouldn't have another chance to bump him off, captured him and threatened to beat the money out of him.  So far, you've escaped from their prison and reached the top of Weinerschnitzel Tower, to which you were led.You ride the elevator to the top floor of the tower.  It consists of only one room.  This room consists of a typical work desk, with phone, computer (A Mac, no less).... and a note.  You pick up the note and begin to read:TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:You smile.  You know they mean you.  What are they trying to do, sound professional?  You continue:WE ARE WELL INTO A SECRET PLOT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.Idiots.  It isn't a secret anymore now, is it?  You could pick up the phone and call the President right now... but you decide to continue reading.IF YOU WANT US TO RECONSIDER, PLEASE SEND $25 TO:You read no further.  You've held onto your money for THIS long, and you're NOT going to give it up now!!  You then discover some fine print at the bottom, and being the wise consumer you are, read:OFFER EXPIRES APRIL 21, 1995.  IF OFFER DOES EXPIRE, YOU WILL DIE.  THIS OFFER HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE PARTY OF FIVE.  ADOLF HITLER, CEO.  (We are not affiliated with 20th Century Fox Television, or a series run by their network.)You look at your watch.  Oh no.  It's the 22nd of April.  You sarcastically yell, "OH NO!  The big bad Nazis are gonna kill me!"Suddenly a secret door opens to your right and some deformed guard comes out.  Before you can blast him you are knocked unconscious from behind.You wake up in what seems to be a vast nothingness - instead of the fact that the fortress of the Party Of Five is right in front of you!  How do you know?  Neon lights don't lie....Now just inside the castle grounds, you must break inside the castle and destroy the Party Of Five!-----------------TO INSTALL RTW EPISODE 3:1. Launch WolfEdit and open the file called "RTW Episode Three."2. Choose Install from the File Menu.3. Open a COPY of your Wolf3d 2nd Enc. program.  Repeat: a COPY, for your original levels will be overwritten and you might want to keep them.4. Quit WolfEdit and launch Wolf3d!------------------MAYBEWARE FEEWhat Is Maybeware?Well, it's a term I invented, because "shareware" seems to turn people off these days.  RTW is NOT shareware.  No, sir.  Of COURSE not.  It's Maybeware, and here's how it works:  play it.  Enjoy it.  Kill Hitler.  Find the stuff you missed.  Kill Hitler 32,767 more times.  Have fun.  THEN: If you think the levels were well-made, and that the game was a good waste of time, MAYBE send in a SMALL fee.  How small?  5 bucks.  That's pretty good considering that 2nd Encounter was $15 for 30 levels.  That's 50 cents per level.  I am asking 5 bucks.... and not just for RTW Episode 1, I mean for ALL of RTW!!!  24 levels, in fact!  That's about 21 cents per level... not even what you'd pay to play any arcade game.  Pretty reasonable, huh?  And when you DO send your measly sum, you'll get these BONUSES:-> Get 3 Mini-Episodes free, each with 3 REALLY HARD levels!!  That's like another episode FREE!  (or 15 cents per level!)-> The satisfaction that you ACTUALLY paid for a shareware-type product!  Then you can go bragging to your friends that you registered something!Oh, sure, Wolf3d was good... but RTW makes it even BETTER!  Order today.... use the included order form!!AJTTHANK YOUIf you already sent your money over, thanks.  If you didn't, here is one worthy cause you'll be contributing to: The "I Should Keep Doing This" Fund.  Think these levels are cool?  You'll see even more if I get some response!Since this is the third and final episode, there isn't as much of an incentive to pay- you won't get the other episodes, because there aren't any!  However, if you HAVE played the full RTW, and you MUST keep your measly $5, I at least want your opinion of how it was and whether I should continue with this in the future.  E-mail me at: yyr57695@aol.com.But if you DO decide to send your money, you'll still get 9 levels FREE.  How's that?
