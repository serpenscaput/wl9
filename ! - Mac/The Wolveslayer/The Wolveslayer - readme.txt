Lastly, the Wolveslayer is an eleven-map scenario for the First Encounter. No storyline and no quirks attached, this is simply a mapset where you go kill people. Lots of people. Some levels are more involved and difficult than others, but generally you should expect slaughter on industrial scale. As usual.
