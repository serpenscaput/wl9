Afrika Korps Assault by Ian Brown, being the dominant part of this post, does not disappoint with its 24 maps and very heavy graphical modifications in the expected style. The year is 1943 and Erwin Rommel is ever the painful boil on the Allies' bloated arse. Time is nigh to put an end to this farce, but the man himself is untouchable. Instead, you're to come after an important member of his field staff, Horst von Oppenfeld. Your chase will start south of Tunis and take you through ancient Egyptian pyramids... Be careful not to rediscover places and entities best left abandoned forever. 

But if you don't mind that curse on your head, you'll notice that Brown's mapping is as always solid in quality and new graphics (as well as map aesthetics in general) are rather impressive and unique. You'll see neat decorations and propaganda posters on pleasant-looking walls, some interesting outdoor textures, Egyptian sprites, brown-uniformed Afrika Korps soldiers, and the transparent wall quadrant feature sees a lot of use to great effect. Mapping is tight, with a lot of corners and pillars, plus hordes of enemies to tackle. If you don't get sick of all the brown (it's pretty common for Mac Wolf mods to be, ah, coloristically consistent, it seems...), you should have a good time.

P.S. Yes, the author is called Brown and the mod is brown too, I get it, yeah...
