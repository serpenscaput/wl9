WOLFENSTEIN 3D: BREAKTHROUGH- THE MINI-EPISODES-----First off, thanks for taking the time to register Breakthrough.  I really appreciate every bit of your support and I'm currently wrestling with the idea of creating a couple of Marathon level sets.  It's tough though!  And on the PC side of things, I'm working on an action-filled fighting-like game called Duel; as well as an RPG called Epik.But in the meantime, here are the Breakthrough Mini-Episodes!  The challenge of twelve new levels awaits.Each episode includes:- four levels- a ReadMe file with the story and objective- and all of the mazes, arenas, taunts and Nazis you loved to hate in Breakthrough!You can almost predict what you'll run into in the Mini-Eps by their titles, but be ready for a few surprises.Thanks again... and Have Fun!AJT
