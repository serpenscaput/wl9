Wolf Pack 1 comprises three scenarios for the First Encounter. They are:
* Escape from Prison 1 has two maps. You are a British soldier who has been captured in battle. You spend your time sulking around in your cell when suddenly you find a gun in your pocket and a key on the floor. Now you can break out easily. The maps are of medium size and offer a fair challenge.
* Fort Ellerstein has two maps. It's the first map ever made by Andres. Storyline: you're an American reporter invited by Hans Grosse to spend a weekend in his headquarters at Forst Ellerstein, but things go sour and of course you find yourself in the dungeon. Can you escape? The maps are rather simplistic, but otherwise solid for a first attempt.
* Spade has one map. The storyline is very simple: you have infiltrated the Nazi hideout codenamed Spade and you're to find the self destruct button, blowing the place up to smithereens. The only floor is very small, but still presents some danger on the hardest difficulty setting, as the author mentions in the readme.

Wolf Pack 2 comprises four scenarios for the First Encounter. They are: 
* Andres' House has two maps. You're Andres Vialpando and you're supposed to stop your fat brother and his minions who have taken over your house. One large map and one small map, with a boss at the end of course.
* Assault on Fortress K has one map. We're fresh out of storylines, now it's all deduction. The fortress actually looks kinda like a fortress, it's pretty large but it's made of only three rooms. A bite-sized portion of Wolfing fun.
* Escape from Prison 2 has two maps. There's nothing about them that really stands out. Medium size, medium challenge, OK designs.
* Rudolf Steiner Schools has three maps, though in terms of editor space it's not the biggest scenario ported today. Small and basic levels, with an obligatory Hans at the end, but otherwise it's not the peak of Mac Wolfing excitement.
