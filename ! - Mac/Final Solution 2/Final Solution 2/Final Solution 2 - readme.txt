The Final Solution. What do you think of this name? Edgy? Perhaps, but also obvious given the theme, as well as rather poetic. The Final Solution is a very well known PC mod by Treece/Parafraction. Final Solution is a somewhat less known Mac mapset by Pier Luigi Andreoni. Twelve maps for the Second Encounter, though there should be no issues with the Third (not that it matters for us here). The PC mod is, surprisingly, not about Jews at all, but rather mad scientists raising soldiers from the dead; you know the drill. The Mac mod isn't actually about anything at all, the author simply promises absolute HELL. Mapping appears to be par for the course - tight design, many enemies. Fairly long and pretty well decorated floors. Worth a go.

Despite being two entirely separate entities, the two Final Solutions do share a certain trait: they come in more than one flavor. For the PC mod, I have in my collection a beta, full versions 2.0 and 3.0, as well as the very recent Final TFS, a sort of polished 2.0 version for SDL. The Mac scenario comes as a five level demo, and then as a release entitled Final Solution 2. For a while I was uncertain on the exact status of the latter - I mean, is it actually a second part? A sequel? Can't be, after all it resuses the demo maps, although with some design improvements. So is it a second demo? I thought so at first, because the original demo promises 30 maps for the final release, while this only has 12. But then, Pier Luigi's ancient website describes Final Solution 2 to be, well, final. And then *again*, the version here (distributed by Clubey as sent to him by the author himself) has 12 maps but the website says 14. Lots of mysteries around here, but for my own purposes, I'm considering this to be a full release. If a 14 map version exists, it's most likely gone forever. Either way, both the demo and full versions are ported here.

Interestingly, in the same readme Clubey actually name-drops the PC mod, noting that the two have nothing to do with each other and the naming is merely a history-related coincidence. Astute.

A word about the author, I guess. Outside of his brief Mac Wolf stint, Pier Luigi Andreoni is an accomplished musician, composer and multiinstrumentalist who has led or participated in many outfits, gracing numerous albums with his uncanny skills. I have heard a few pieces and while my understanding of music theory is nil, I find them simply interesting and pleasant to listen to. Look him up on Discogs.
