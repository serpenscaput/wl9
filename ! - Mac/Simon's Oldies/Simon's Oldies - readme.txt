Simon's Oldies is a collection of First Encounter mapsets by Bicman alias Simon. They come with no attached text files, just scenario names and maps. The only available documentation is found on Bicman's website (http://bicman.free.fr/index.php?id=400 archive: http://archive.is/5rxiU), where he explains his mods won't work with Third Encounter, outlines how to install the Oldies scenarios with First Encounter, and mentions that some of his mods made it on the cover CD of a French Mac magazine, SVM MAC.

HOW TO RUN MODS: the --file command. Run the game as macenwolf --file foldername to run a mod of your choice after you have placed its folder in the main game folder. For example, if you download Spear of Longinus and extract it into the main folder, macenwolf --file longinus will run the mod. There should generally be a .bat file available too.

Changes:
*Map 4 of GORE!!! was missing a gold key, this is now rectified
*The final map of Kick'em Down was modified by adding a missing silver key
*I was forced to slightly modify map 1 of Sim Extreme World, as the vanilla map was not possible to complete (lacking the actual elevator switch and all)
