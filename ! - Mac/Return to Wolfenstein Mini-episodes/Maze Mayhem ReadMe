RTW Mini-Episode 2: Maze MayhemTHE STORYLost.  First it was in the depths of your office building, and suddenly, without warning, you found yourself here.  Where are you?  All you can remember is that you found a door and opened it.  Next thing you know, you're face to face with a brown-shirted Nazi.  And what are all these corridors here for?  It seems like a gigantic maze!  How will you ever get out?Well, for starters, you killed the Nazi and stole his gun.  His gun won't do you much good though, considering that it's only a pistol.  Hmmm.... you're kinda hungry.  Maybe you can get out of here before your wife serves dinner....MAZE MAYHEMIf you remember RTW, you'll remember several small mazes (and a few big ones, too).  Well, this Mini-Ep is devoted to those wonderful creations!  Be careful, though.  Zombies will attack without warning and Nazis are everywhere.  We even threw in a couple of bosses....  To complete this scenario, you must either: a) beat Hitler on the 3rd floor or b) find the exit on the 3rd floor.  Hitler is not going to be easy, because ammo is scarce.  But finding the exit won't be easy either!  If you can beat this on the Death Incarnate level, you're a REALLY GOOD player!AJT
