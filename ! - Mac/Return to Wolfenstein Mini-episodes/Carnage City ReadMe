RTW Mini-Episode 1: Carnage CityTHE STORYYou are as low as they come.  You're the bottom of the barrel.  The scum.  The lowlife of all lowlives.  In your spare time you burn things and kill small animals.  You live to kill, destroy, torture and otherwise wreak havoc on other living beings.  This offer was one you couldn't refuse.A government official has sent you to stop a Nazi uprising.  You have been sent to attack their headquarters, a small building in central Berlin.  Upon entering, you find an awesome arsenal of weapons.  You also sense prey nearby... tons of them.  Heck, there could be almost two hundred armed Nazis in this tiny, three-level building.  You like those odds....CARNAGE CITYTo clear this scenario, you must kill the leader of the Nazi uprising.  He is located on the third floor and looks suspiciously like Adolf Hitler.  Beware!  He's not the only one waiting in that room!Before you can do this, though, you're gonna have to mow down Nazis by the dozen.  And by the dozen you will... one room can contain as many as 24 of the savages!  (That's two dozen, by the way.)  There will be plenty of ammo and health items to keep you going, but will it be enough?  No, unless you have the skill to overcome their numerical advantage.  Just try and beat this on a hard difficulty level!!!AJT
