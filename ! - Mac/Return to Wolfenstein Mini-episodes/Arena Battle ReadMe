RTW Mini-Episode 3: Arena BattleTHE STORYYou seek challenges in your spare time.  You're practically looking for trouble.  Guess what?  You just found some.A crazed game-show host has thrown you into a 3-level compound made up of multiple arenas.  Within these arenas, large and small, you will be attacked by multitudes of Nazi replicas.  You must defeat the Hitler replica in the final arena to win this scenario.ARENA BATTLEYou'll probably remember several arenas from RTW.  An arena is basically a large square or rectangular room in which you fight multiple enemies which enter the arena around you.  There's usually no way to escape an arena until you defeat all of the enemies.Have fun fighting through these arenas.  There are very few secrets, especially on the final level, so don't waste all your time looking for them.  They are, however, hinted just as they were in RTW.If you can beat this at the hardest level (Death Incarnate), consider yourself a master at Arena Battles!AJT
