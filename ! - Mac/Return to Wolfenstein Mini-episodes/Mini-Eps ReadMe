Thanks for "registering" RTW!!I thank you greatly for all of your support.  $5 may not seem like much to you, but to me it's more than just mere money; it's the thought that I actually made something that someone else enjoyed.  This encourages me to make more levels for you!As a registered RTW player, you will receive Wolfenstein 3D: Breakthrough, my First Encounter level set, as soon as it's finished.  If you checked the blank on the order form, you'll also be asked to test Breakthrough as it is developed, possibly adding suggestions or changing the level to make it better.  Thanks again for all of your support!Here are your free Mini-Episodes.  The RTW Mini-Eps are three 3-level scenarios.  Each has a different focus and storyline.  They're pretty tough.  Arena Battle isn't all that tough but expect a LOT from the other ones!  They're all just my way of saying, "Thanks."Enjoy the Mini-Eps and keep in touch!!AJT
