Clubey's 4th Encounter(10 levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis scenario was made in my earlier years just for the fun of making levels and brushing up my editing skills. This was the 4th complete scenario that I made (thus is the title...). Most of the levels I made from scratch, and some I borrowed from others. Sorry, I don't remember whose levels I used as the basis to work on, but most of them are pretty much altered to see any of its original structure. If anyone thinks he/she should receive credit for any level in this scenario, you've got it! Just email me.It is designed for play with the 1st and 2nd Encounter applications only, so don't play with it on the 3rd Encounter. It won't crash your computer or anything but it might become a nightmare!Some things you'd better know about before playing this scenario is the "magical sweetspot bug" and the "corner-shooting technique". Most of you would think that some of these levels are impossible to clear, unless you knew about these tips. I've written about it in detail in my website. It's in the Ultra-Tips corner, so check it out!The death version is only a slightly moderated version of the 1.0 version. It's supposed to be a bit harder.CopyrightsIf you do something with this scenario, just give me credit, and everything else is yours!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
