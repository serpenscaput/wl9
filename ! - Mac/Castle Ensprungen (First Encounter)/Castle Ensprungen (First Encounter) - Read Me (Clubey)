Castle EnsprungenAntoni Chan   (8 levels for the 2nd Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 2nd Encounter, and was made by Antoni Chan.Though the author himself states that this scenario was intended for the 1st Encounter, it is for the 2nd!! When flamethrowers and rocket launchers, Officers, mutants and Trans Grosse come out, what else could it be?I know nothing about this author besides the fact that he made this scenario. And it's a pretty good one, too.If you know anything about this author or of any other scenario of his, please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpOther StuffThis scenario was slightly revised by Clubey, myself, to avoid some bugs to appear. CopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
