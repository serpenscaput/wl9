And now we move to the very end of the alphabet, where we encounter Zombie Breakout by Dougero. Three levels for the Second Encounter, this scenario's outstanding aspect is abstract and unusual, sometimes outright chaotic architecture. Take the sights in as you move through the maps, but mind the large number of enemies in the way, protecting Hitler himself.
