The Castle of Hell is a two-level demo scenario for the First Encounter, made by OH MY GOD WE ACTUALLY KNOW! Steg Keable! Hello, Steg! The maps are unfortunately nothing special, just a bunch of rooms with simple shapes and a bunch of enemies here and there. Thoroughly average. As mentioned, it's just a demo: the full version was available for ≈Å3.50+Postage and included a total of seven maps. Probably lost forever.
