Treasure Hunt

For months, the Nazis have been amassing a large collection of stolen treasure and religious artifacts and stashing them away at top secret installations all across Europe. Your mission is to infiltrate one of these heavily defended fortresses and take back some of this ill-gotten booty. But beware -- getting out with the goods might be a great deal harder than getting in!
