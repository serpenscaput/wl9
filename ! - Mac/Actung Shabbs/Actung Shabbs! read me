Actung Shabbs!

Shabbs is at it again in this three level set. Except this time your not there to stop him from creating a horrid mutant race that will overwhelm the Allies and turn the tide of the war (he already did that). Your there to assasinate him once and for all.
	So knowing hat he's staying at one of his many strongholds you set out to do somthing you think you shoulda a long time ago.
