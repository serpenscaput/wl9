Actung Shabbs by Andres Vialpando is a 3-level Third Encounter scenario. You're going to hear about Andres again soon - a lot. In the meantime, have this small scenario as a sampler. The maps are very small, but relatively interesting, with designs progressing beyond simple square rooms. The going is tough, for example in map 2 you will have to make do with just one medkit while facing a large number of enemies on such a small map.
