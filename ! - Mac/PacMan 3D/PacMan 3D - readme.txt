PacMan 3D is a Third Ecnounter scenario released under the moniker of WolfAddict. Five maps here, though they're really five variants of the same familiar PacMan layout. The small maze is full of balls. Red balls serve as health restoring items, while yellow balls and various ball-shaped fruit (strewn around here and there) are treasure. Your enemies include PacMan ghosts (duh) and what appears to be small PacMan clones full of sharp teeth and not-so-sharp dung. The scenario makes surprisingly good use of the few new graphics included, as smooth blue walls combine with new ceiling and floor colours to change the game's atmosphere and setting completely.
