The other part of this update is a scenario called He's Behined You! It was made by Luke Bailey and has three maps for the First Encounter. The maps are pretty small and while there's some potential for good fights in certain places, it's rather diminished because there's little in terms of guards. Actually, the final map is almost completely devoid of enemies, which leaves the impression that the scenario was unfinished. Play at your own risk.===CREDITS===Luke Bailey.
