Crimson Kahnage is a massive mod for the Third Encounter made by Dermuda. Following the destruction of the Twin Towers on 9/11, the world explodes in violence, culminating in nuclear warfare between Europe and the faltering United States. Almost all of humanity is eradicated as a result. Moving back in time and into another planetary system, a bitter war between two species, Layphid and Krimni, has been raging for thousands of years, with the latter slowly losing ground. The leader of the Krimni, Kahn the Oppressor, was growing increasingly desperate for new breakthroughs in military technology, until the Krimni accidentally discover the Sol system and witness the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima. Atom bombs were just the tech the Krimni needed to tip the scales of the war in their favor. Determine to succeed, they abduct Adolf Hitler, who describes the world in great detail and teaches them the virtues of fascism. The Krimni develop holographic disguises for themselves and set out to conquer Earth, which at this point is a radiated wasteland. Only five men survive, five scientists sheltered by their underground neutrino detector. You are one of these researchers and you must rid the Earth of its new Krimni scourge. But can you do it?

Crimson Kahnage comes in two versions: the original 1.0 version and the significantly revised 2021 release inspired in part by the MacenWolf project (watch me gleam with pride). The first release had 48 maps; the re-release includes five new secret levels, clocking in at 53. Other than an overall overhaul, bugfixing and new content, the 2021 version has also been made somewhat easier, as the original is said to have been extremely punishing in its difficulty. Assets used in Crimson Kahnage come from various mods by Laz Rojas, Jon Wigand and Clubey; there is also one new sound in the mix. Overall it's an interesting and huge package of content that Mac modding fans should enjoy greatly.
