Is only one floor of a new scenario I have been workingfor the last couple of months. I was hoping to have it ready for christmasbut as everybody knows it is a lot of work. At this time the graphics areabout 80% percent completed and the levels well, i am just getting started.So hopefully by early spring it will be ready with all the graphics andnew sounds. Here is an example of a character (Ubermutant) fully renderedwith Raytracing and what it looks like during the game.</font><font size=+2></font><p><img SRC="ubermutant.jpg" BORDER=0 height=700 width=500></center><p><font size=+2>&nbsp;This level was created with WolfEdit 2.0.4, StrataVision™3d 4.0 and Photoshop&reg; 5.5 .
