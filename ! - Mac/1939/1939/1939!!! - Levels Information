1939!!! Level InfoSorry for being incomplete but the first three levels I didn't keep track of.  Items are:  Guns, Clips, Med-Kits, Decorations, and treasure.  Guards are how many enemies were put into the level. Time to Create is how many Hours:Min:Secs to create the level.  Look for 1940!!! a little later on this year.Level	Items	Guards	Time to Create1-1		N\A		N\A		N\A1-2		N\A		N\A		N\A1-3		N\A		N\A		N\A1-4		114		71		0:11:461-5		147		94		0:15:371-6		145		94		0:19:021-7		132		82		0:18:391-8		124		99		0:18:061-9		145		92		0:14:491-0		44		1		0:2:23Totals	851		533		1:40:22
