SuperCarnage! Oh boy, another nine maps for the First Encounter! The readme advertises this one as a "complete bunkers with views of the outside world", but what you really get is some extremely small, tight maps with a lot of guards in them. Par for the course. Several maps feature the brothers Grimm (it's funny because they were German too, you see?) and the entire second "episode" seems to have been set up as a challenge of sorts, as the author does not believe you can beat these levels without cheats. And by golly, he's right. When you're surrounded by bosses from all sides and diagonals with like three tiles to maneuver in, it's a lost cause.
