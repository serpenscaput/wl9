This document is the result of many hours of experimenting, searching for documentation, and compiling data.  It is intended to be a handy reference for those wishing 
to create better levels with WolfEdit, as well as a detailed description of the idiosyncrasies of Wolfenstein 3D.

This document is nowhere near complete.  There are, for example, WolfEdit hacks that IŐve heard of, but don't know what the file names are, who wrote them, where 
to get them, etc.  I would like to be able to make The (Almost) Complete Guide to Wolfenstein 3DŞ more complete.  If you have (or know where to get) anything that 
isn't listed in this document, or know of something about the game that isnŐt covered in this document, please let me know.

Introduction to The (Almost) Complete Guide to Wolfenstein 3DŞ

This document includes all of the data that I have been able to accumulate about the Wolfenstein 3DŞ game for the Macintosh, whether by self-determination or by 
finding documentation of someone else's work.  I have attempted to put everything into an order that will allow the reader to deal with a given topic without being 
exposed to other unrelated topics.

Most of the information in this document was produced by my own hand (experimenting with WolfEdit 1.1 and using ResEdit to unravel the resources), but certain data 
was produced by others.  The Credits chapter contains a list of all of the sources used to compile this document.

While I have attempted to cover all 3 versions of Wolfenstein 3DŞ, the obvious route to take for level development is tending to lean towards 3rd Encounter Episode 
files, as these are the easiest way to produce levels for the game that don't require writing changes to the game itself.  Therefore, most of the discussion concerning 
the creation of levels will be written toward that end.  Note that to use the same data for 1st or 2nd Encounters, you need only to save the level(s) as WolfEdit 
files, and follow WolfEdit's instructions for installing into Wolfenstein 3DŞ.  Of course, there are certain restrictions to the use of enemies, weapons and objects 
in a given level when installing into 1st or 2nd Encounters.  I have attempted to cover this as thoroughly as possible.

Wolfenstein 3D 3rd Encounter includes the following resources also found in the external episode files:

 Rsrc
  ID  Item Name
 135  Sound effect list
 137  WallList
 145  GamePal
 147  Music List

Of these, 147 (Music List) is the only one that would be required in an episode file, as the list differs according to the number of levels in that episode.  Wolfenstein 
3DŞ 3rd Encounter has the Music List resource of 2nd Encounter, making that resource not required if you are placing the 2nd Encounter levels into an Episode file 
for 3rd Encounter.

I don't yet understand exactly what GamePal (145) is, or what it contains.  I do know that all 3 versions of Wolfenstein 3DŞ contain the resource, as well as each 
of the external Episode files of 3rd Encounter.  I also know that all of the versions of Wolfenstein 3DŞ and all of the Episode files use the same GamePal.  It is 
always the same item ID, the same size, and as far as I can tell the exact same data.

Other than the above resources (and each levels map resource), episode files also include the following resources:

 Rsrc
  ID  Item Name
   1  Signature
 146  Map list

Signature only has 7 text characters, which spell Wolf 3D.  The Map list resource is unique to each episode.

To be safe, I suggest creating a ŇblankÓ episode file that includes all of the resources found in the original episode files, and using a copy of it for adding the 
unique Map list, Music List, and Map Level resources with WolfEdit.

The purpose of this document is to bring together in one place the bulk of the knowledge so far obtained about the inner workings of Wolfenstein 3DŞ, data concerning 
the extensions available for Wolfenstein 3DŞ, and knowledge about the level editor WolfEdit (and it's complement, the WolfMaker auto-level maker).

I hope that this will allow those who are creating levels for Wolfenstein to create better levels, as well as to allow the authors of WolfEdit, WolfMaker, and (yes) 
even Wolfenstein 3DŞ to produce programs that are even better than the current versions.

I downloaded a file called ÔWolfenstein 3D 1.0.3.sitŐ from LAMG out of the Vault ŐO Files archive (a CD-ROM that they receive periodically with the latest shareware 
stuff on it).  The sit contained a Stuffit Installer file named Wolfenstein 3DŞ Installer.  The installer created a folder named Wolfenstein 3DŞ folder.  The folder 
contained 3 files; Read Me, Wolfenstein 3DŞ Set, and Wolfenstein 3DŞ First Encounter.  A Get Info call showed that the version number of the 1.0.3 file is 1.0.1. 
 The file size and creation date, however, didn't jive with what I already have.  As an aside, the Read Me included with 1.0.3 is identical to the Read Me included 
with the 1.0 -> 1.0.1 patch file, and the archive also included the same set file (for the Gravis gamepad) that the 1.0 archive originally included.

Note that throughout this discussion, the following definitions apply:

   1.0 = the original game
1.0.1 = the patched version I already have
1.0.3 = the new one I downloaded
The patch file is a ResCompare patch file that I downloaded when I first got Wolfenstein 3D 1st Encounter 1.0

Using a copy of the Wolfenstein 3DŞ 1st Encounter 1.0.1 file I already had, I used ResCompare to see what differences it could detect.  For those unfamiliar with 
ResCompare's output, the blue line represents the data that is changed between the Master file (left side) and the Update file (right side).  The following 3 Alert 
resources were different:

Each of these shows that the values of the patched version were changed in the 1.0.3 version all in the same places (From the range of 00 to 0D, 01-07 were changed 
in each resource).
 
Using ResEdit, I did furthur investigating to find out the reason for the 20011 byte difference in file size.  I found the following.

                      1.0        1.0.1       1.0.3
                    -------    ---------   ---------

     Creation Date: 9/23/94     9/23/94     10/6/94
          FileSize: 1609710     1609042     1629053  bytes

Patch File Creation Date: 10/10/94
    Patch File File Size: 60072 bytes

Differences:        1.0 <-- 1.0.1   1.0.1 <-- 1.0.3   1.0 <-- 1.0.3
                    -------------   ---------------   -------------
    Resource Fork:  -668            0                 -668          bytes
        Data Fork:  0               20011             20011         bytes
    Creation Date:  0               -14               -14           days
         FileSize:  -668            20011             19343         bytes

The patch file seems to be 4 days newer than the 1.0.3 version of the game.

I cannot explain the 20011 byte difference between the 1.0/1.0.1 and 1.0.3 versions data forks, except to say that it is the same size as the 2nd Encounter game's 
data fork.  3rd Encounter has 105754 bytes in its data fork.  I used HexEdit 1.0.4 to read the data forks of both 1.0.1 and 1.0.3, and copied the data into 2 separate 
resource files in ResEdit, and then used ResCompare to see what the differences were.  The result was over 1 meg of data showing insertions, changes and deletions 
(as well as identical data) that was too much to deal with.  I did the same with 2nd Encounter, and compared its data fork to the 1.0.3 version's data fork.  While 
the sizes of the data forks (2nd Encounter and the 1.0.3 version) are the same, the contents are not identical.  Since the size is prohibitive towards duplicating 
the entire ResCompare output, I have elected to include only the differences:

=======================================================================================

ResCompare doesn't compare data forks, and this would explain the difference between the 1.0.1 and 1.0.3 versions, but it doesn't explain the differences in the 
Alert resources.  Also, a comparison of the 2nd Encounter resources shows that the Screen Size resource (130) is identical to the 1.0.3 Screen Size resource, but 
the 2 Shareware alert resources are different.  Now, this makes sense, considering that the shareware notices in 2nd Encounter are different from the shareware notices 
in 1st Encounter, but brings up the question of why are the shareware resources in 1.0.1 and 1.0.3 different from each other when they are supposed to be the same 
notices?

I took a virgin copy of Wolf 3D 1.0, and a virgin copy of the 1.0 -> 1.0.1 patch and (after restarting with all extensions off) created a new patched version.  The 
new patched version turned out exactly the same as the patched version I used to compare to the 1.0.3 version I downloaded.

Before doing any of the above work, I called MacPlay's order line to see what the current versions of Wolfenstein 3DŞ are.  A followup call to customer support verified 
the order line's response.  The current versions are:

1st Encounter:  1.0.1
2nd Encounter:  1.0.1
3rd Encounter:  1.0.2

The questions are:

1) Is the 1.0.3 version supposed to be smaller than the 1.0/1.0.1 version, and (if so) by how much?
2) Is the data fork of the 1.0.3 version supposed to be the same size as the 1.0/1.0.1 version, or is it supposed to be 20011 bytes larger?
3) Are the 3 Alert resources supposed to be different between 1.0/1.0.1 and 1.0.3?
4) Why are the shareware alert resources in 1.0/1.0.1 and 1.0.3 different from each other when they are supposed to be the same notices?
5) Is the 1.0 -> 1.0.1 patch file an official patch, or did someone just make a patch and distribute it?
6) Are there supposed to be any differences between the 1.0.3 and 2nd Encounter data forks?

Based on a return phone call from MacPlay Tech Support, the programmers stated that the 1.0.3 file doesn't sound like the 1.0.1 version that MacPlay released (they 
believe that it is a hacked version).  I have uploaded a copy of the archive to the Interplay BBS so that the programmers can get a first-hand look at it and determine 
it legitimacy.  Chris (tech support) has agreed to inform me of the programmers determination when they have reached a conclusion.

As of 12/30/95, Interplay has not verified anything to me.  I can only assume that their original hypothesis that the 1.0.3 version is a hack is true. 


Map List Resource

The Map List is in BRGR resource 146.  It begins with a 2-word header:

 Offset	Size	Description
	0	     word	Number of levels
	2	     word	Resource ID of the first level

Following this is a 5-word entry for each level:

Each of the values in hex represents a separate entry in the resource, for a total of 64 entries.  The entries 013A-013D represent the Daytime Landscape, Nighttime 
Landscape, Lift Wall and Lift Control Panel sprites, respectively.  Since each of these sprites represents only one aspect of a wall block (east-west or north-south 
view), there is only a single entry for each.  The 414B-414E entries represent the plain, gold-key, silver-key doors and door jamb sprites.  With these also, since 
they represent one aspect of a wall block (or object), there is only a single entry for each.  I don't yet know why these have bit 7 set.  The last entry is the 
lift door.  I still don't know why it doesn't have bit 7 set when the other doors and door jamb do.

With all of the other walls, the 2nd entry for each is the same value as the Res ID plus bit 8 is set.  At first, I thought that this had something to do with the 
walls that had alternate codes for display in the map section of the level resource.  However, there are 4 walls that have no alternate code.  Every wall type is 
represented in this resource, so it had to be something else.  Then it dawned on me.  The items with the second value were the walls that had 2 views (east-west 
and north-south view).  It was from this, and the codes in the wall code list that enabled me to determine which walls were the landscape, lift and control panel 
walls, and which were the doors and door jamb.
 
Sound Effect List Resource

The Sound Effect List is in BRGR resource 135.

This is what the Sound Effect List Resource looks like:

 0080 0081 0082 0083
 0084 0085 0086 0087
 0088 0089 008A 008B
 008C 008D 008E 008F
 0090 0091 0092 0093
 0094 0095 0096 0097
 0098 0099 009A 009B
 009C 009D 009E 009F
 00A0 00A1 00A2 00A3
 00A4 00A5 00A6 00A7
 00A8 00A9 FFFF

It appears that there are 42 sound effects in the game, with each sound having a call code in the range of 64 to 105.  I assume that $FFFF is the end of sound effects 
marker.  It may be possible that there are other sound effects, but these are the only ones identified. 


Level Map Resource

Originally by: Greg Ewing

ACGW: I believe that the discrepancies in the descriptions of segments in Greg Ewing's BSP Tree format may well be a contributor to the various problems encountered 
in levels created with WolfEdit, if these descriptions have been followed to the letter by Greg in WolfEdit.  My observations have shown me that the descriptions, 
if followed to the letter in building the BSP Tree, will create a segment map that is sideways and flipped over from what the map actually looks like.  The following 
is a detailed synopsys of the format of the level resources in the BRGR resource, using Greg Ewing's level format description, and adding notes where they were applicable. 
 For the test level, I chose Level 1-9 from the 3rd Encounter episode Escape From Wolfenstein.  That level has the benefit being relatively smaller in the area used 
than most other levels in the game, and has the fewest objects.  This made the resource smaller, and enabled me to compile the following in it's entirety instead 
of having to chop parts out because of length.  Even so, all of the related material spans the next 4 chapters as well as this one because of the length.  As an 
aside, all of the ÔgraphicsŐ included here are in 7-point Monaco text (Monaco for the mono-spaced font, and 7-point to fit the screen width), except for the Object 
List ÔgraphicŐ (which was small enough to fit without shrinking it).  Address locations are for the test level.

Map Section

The map section is 4096 bytes long, organized as a 64 by 64 grid.  Each byte in the map represents either a solid block, a door or an empty space.  If bit 7 of the 
byte is 1, then it represents a solid block or door, and the rest of the bits determine what kind of wall or door it is.

If bit 7 is 0, the byte contains a room number.  A room is a contiguous space which is completely divided off from other rooms by walls or doors.  There may be up 
to 64 rooms, numbered 0 to 63.  Each byte in the map representing an empty space contains the room number to which the space belongs.
 
Start of Map: 0000

Sound Area Table

Start of Sound Area Table: 1000

This is a 64-byte table containing a sound area number for each room.  When you fire your gun, guards in rooms belonging to the same sound area can hear you.  If 
they're not "shoot only on sight" guards, they will seek you out.

ACGW: Wolfenstein normally has all unused rooms set to null (0). 

WolfEdit 1.1 does not provide any way of setting sound areas; each room is placed in a separate sound area. (Note, however, that an area separated from a room by 
a secret door is considered part of the same room.)

Header of Variable-Length Part

Start of Variable-Length Header: 1040

The variable-length part begins with a 4-word header.  Entries marked with * are stored in little-endian byte order (least significant byte first).

ACGW: Greg originally didn't have these 4 items designated as little-endian (*), though they are stored this way.

	0	word*	Number of objects
	2	word*	Offset from start of resource to object table
	4	word*	Number of entries in BSP tree
	6	word*	Offset from start of resource to BSP tree

Object Table

Start of Object Table: 1048

The object table contains an entry for each object appearing on the level.  Each entry is either 3 or 4 bytes long, depending on the object type.

	0	byte	 x-coordinate of map cell (0 to 63)
	1	byte	 y-coordinate of map cell (0 to 63)
	2	byte	 Object type

ACGW: If the object type is 64 or 65, then the object represents an exit control panel.  64 is the code for the normal exit from the level (next level), and 65 is 
the code for exit to a secret level (alternate next level).  The map location associated with this object is usually a lift wall/control panel ($8F).

If the object type is $62, then the object is a secret door.  In the map, a secret door appears as an empty space, and there is an extra byte in the object table 
entry containing the wall type:

	3	byte	 Wall type of secret door (object type $62 only)

BSP Tree

Start of BSP Tree: 113D

About the BSP Tree

A Binary Space Partitioning or BSP tree is used to divide the map space up into portions in such a way that the rendering engine can efficiently determine which 
parts are visible.

The BSP tree consists of two types of nodes, terminal and non-terminal.  Each node corresponds to some rectangular portion of the map.  A non-terminal node is further 
subdivided into two child nodes.  A terminal node is not subdivided any further and has no children; it is a "leaf" of the tree.

A terminal node consists of a collection of segments.  A segment represents part of a wall - a boundary between an empty and a filled-in region of the map.

The coordinate system used to describe segments has twice the resolution of the map cell coordinate system used in the object table.  Furthermore, instead of referring 
to cells, segment coordinates refer to the dividing lines between cells.  So, whereas cell coordinates range from 0 to 63, segment coordinates range from 0 to 128(*). 
 Even segment coordinates correspond to the lines running between map cells- odd segment coordinates refer to lines which pass through the middle of map cells.  
(The reason for this will become clear later.)

ACGW: * Greg states 128, but the range is 0 to 127, or 128 possible positions.

Each segment is described by three coordinates.  For segments running east-west these are its position in the y direction and the x-coordinates of its two endpoints. 
 For segments running north-south, the roles of x and y are reversed.

Each segment also faces in a particular direction.  An east-west segment can face either north or south, and a north-south segment can face either east or west. 
 The direction a segment faces determines from which side it will be visible; the rendering engine doesn't bother drawing segments which are facing away from you.


A terminal node of the tree contains a collection of segments such that no segment can obscure part of any other segment from any viewing position.
 
Format of the BSP Tree

The BSP tree consists of a sequence of 6-byte entries, numbered from 0.  The root node of the tree begins at entry 0.

Each non-terminal node takes up one entry structured as follows:

     Non-Terminal Node
      +----------------  Split Coordinate
      | +--------------  Flags
      | | +------------  First Child
      | | |  +---------  Second Child
      | | |  |
      - - -- --
     |0|1|2 |4 |
      - - -- --

	0	byte	Split coordinate
    For an east-west split, this is the y-coordinate of the splitting line; for north-south, the x-coordinate.
    Byte Values     00-7F  Even = cell border, Odd = cell center

ACGW: There may be a problem with the above description.  Every use of x/y coordinates I've ever seen, as used for display on a screen, the x is the vertical (or 
column) coordinate, and the y is the horizontal (or row) coordinate.  Also, east/west splits and north/south splits are usually described as being east separated 
from west, and north separated from south, respectively.  In light of this, either Greg's use of x and y are reversed from what I know as normal, or his use of east/west 
and north/south splits are reversed from what I know as normal, or he just made a mistake when typing in the description.  Simply, I used his descriptions of east/west 
and north/south and x and y according to what I know as normal, and the BSP map I built from the tree for the level I used for testing turned out sideways and flipped 
over.  What should have been north was east, south was west, west was north, and east was south.  When I switched the x and the y, the BSP map came out correctly. 
 Also, there is an additional note that he didn't include, though someone not familiar would need to know it.  If Entry 0 is a North/South Split then the x coordinate 
is 0, if Entry 0 is an East/West Split then the y coordinate is 0.  I suggest using the following as a guide:

    East/West Splits:  Dividing line runs vertically, use x (column) coordinate
    North/South Splits:  Dividing line runs horizontally, use y (row) coordinate

Here is an example of east/west and north/south splits:

    east/west split (dividing line runs north/south)     north/south split (dividing line runs east/west)
  byte 00         x                         byte 01           x
               +-----+                                     +-----+
               |  |  |                                     |     |
              y|  |  |x                                   y|-----|x
               |  |  |                                     |     |
               +-----+                                     +-----+
                  y                                           y
According to GregŐs description, the above is reversed.

	1	byte	Flags
  	Bit 7 of this byte is 0, indicating a non-terminal node. Bit 0 indicates the direction along which the space
    covered by this node is split to create the subspaces of its child nodes.  0 means the splitting line runs
    east-west, 1 north-south.

ACGW: I believe that Greg has the above description backwards.  Refer to the previous note for the explanation.  0 means north/south and 1 means east/west.  Also, 
the test level I used showed Entry 0 as being value 00 on the flag byte.  If 00 is an east/west dividing line, then Level 1-9 of 3rd encounter episode 1 is displayed 
(in the map section) sideways and flipped over from what it really looks like.  In the game map (see the Map Section), it shows to be a long side running north/south 
(with start in the south and exit in the north and on the east) and a short side running east/west (with the large secret room on the west, and a small secret room 
on the east just south of the exit).  According to Greg's description, this level should be long side east/west (with start in the east and exit in the west and 
on the south), the large secret room on the north, and the small secret room in the south just east of the exit.  That is the way that the BSP map I built originally 
looked.  Switching the x and the y, and counting the value 00 as a north/south dividing line (east-west split) and 01 as an east/west dividing line (north/south 
split) caused the BSP map to look the same way that the map is displayed in the map section.

	2	word*	First child
    Entry number of the first child node.  The subspace covered by this child is the one with coordinates
    *greater* than that of the splitting line.
						
	4	word*	Second child
    Entry number of the other child node.

The coordinates of the region covered by each node are not explicitly stored in the node- rather, they are implicit in the coordinates of the splitting lines at 
each step, and the fact that the root node covers the whole of the map.
 
ACGW: The child node values are the entry number that the node points to.  To find the node, count the entries (beginning with entry 0) and count (in hex) until 
you find the entry with the same number.

Each terminal node takes up one entry for each segment as follows:

	0	byte	Segment position
    For an east-west (or north-south) segment, this is the position of the segment in the y (or x) direction.
    Byte Values
      00-7F  Even = cell border, Odd = cell center

	1	byte	Flags
    Bit 7 of this byte is 1, indicating a terminal node.  Bit 6 is set to 1 if this is the last segment belonging to

	2	byte	Start coordinate
	3	byte	End coordinate
    For east-west (or north-south) segments, these are the x (or y) coordinates of the segment's endpoints.

ACGW: Again, I believe that these are reversed.  east-west segments are y and north-south segments are x.

	4	byte	Map row/column
    For east-west segments, this is the map cell coordinate (0 to 63) of the map row containing the wall block
    immediately behind the segment.  For north-south segments, it is the column number plus 64.  (For
    segments associated with doors, this byte has a different interpretation - see below.)
						
	5	byte	Room number
    This is the room number of the room into which the segment faces.

About Doors

Associated with a door are four special segments, one each side of the door facing inwards, and one along each face of the door itself (the sliding part).  The latter 
two are positioned in the middle of the map cell containing the door.

The side segments have byte 4 of the segment entry set to $80.  The sliding segments have this byte set to $80 plus the door number: each door on a level has a unique 
number from 1 upwards.

ACGW: The level I used for testing showed 6 segments per door.  They are arranged in the following manner (for generic purposes, the sides of the sliding part of 
the door will be referred to as Side A and Side B):

     Side A and Side B both occupy the same placement
     Jamb segments left and right of door, two segments for each jamb

ACGW: See the BSP Tree listing for the test level.

About Lifts

The lift control panel and the side panels with hand railings are represented in the map by the same code ($8F).  If you are looking at the east or west face of 
the block, it appears as a lift control panel; if you are looking at the north or south face, it appears as a hand railing.

However, the lift control panel also has an object with a code of $64 at the same location.  It is the presence of this object which causes the block to behave like 
a lift when you operate it.  If this object is not present, the control panel is just another piece of wall.  Conversely, placing a $64 object on top of some other 
type of wall will make it behave like a lift.  This could allow for some very unfair levels...

ACGW: If the code present in the object list is a $65, then the object is an exit to a secret level.  I have added the following segment to Greg's original treatise.


Exit Lift to Secret Level

In WolfEdit, all exit lift controls are given a code (in the object list portion of the level resource) of $64.  The code for an exit to secret level is $65.  All 
you have to do is replace the $64 for a specified lift control to $65 in the object list to engage this.  However, there is more that you will have to do with the 
Map List resourceÉ
 
In WolfEdit, all levels in the map list are given a next level and an alternate level of $FFFF.  This won't work with secret levels.  For secret levels, you have 
to organize the list, as $FFFF is used to denote the last level of the game.  Use the following as a guide.

In Episode 1 of 3rd Encounter, Level 1-0 (the 10th level) is the secret level.  The map list resource shows the following:

     000A 00C8 0001 0009
     003C 0001 0001 0002
     0002 004B 0001 0002
     0003 0003 003C 0001
     0003 0004 0004 003C
     0001 0004 0005 0005
     0069 0001 0005 0006
     0006 0069 0001 0006
     0007 0007 0069 0001
     0007 0008 0008 005A
     0001 0008 FFFF FFFF
     0096 0001 0009 0001
     0001 00C3 0001 0000

Organized, it looks like this:

     Total Levels  ID of First Level
     000A          00C8

     Next  Alt   Par   Floor  Level
 00  0001  0009  003C  0001   0001
 01  0002  0002  004B  0001   0002
 02  0003  0003  003C  0001   0003
 03  0004  0004  003C  0001   0004
 04  0005  0005  0069  0001   0005
 05  0006  0006  0069  0001   0006
 06  0007  0007  0069  0001   0007
 07  0008  0008  005A  0001   0008
 08  FFFF  FFFF  0096  0001   0009
 09  0001  0001  00C3  0001   0000

If this episode had been created with WolfEdit, all of the Next and Alternate level values would be $FFFF.  Since that wouldn't work, the values would have to be 
changed to agree with the above.

$FFFF is used by Wolfenstein 3D to mark the last level, meaning no next level and no alternate next level.

Notice that all of the Next level values are consecutive through entry #7, with values of 1 through 8.  Entry #8 then shows last level by the value $FFFF.  Entry 
#9 then shows a Next Level of 1.  The Alternate next levels start with 9, then are consecutive fom 2 through 8, then the last level, then 1.

What this all means is that Level 1-1 has 2 exits, one to the next level, and one to Level 1-0 (the secret level).  Level 1-0 returns to the level following Level 
1-1.  This, in combination with a lift control on level 1-1 with a code of $65, will allow the player to go to the secret level using that lift, and to the next 
adjacent level using the regular lift (code $64).

Continued in next Chapter


Continued from last Chapter

Only one exit to secret level may exist on any given level.  However, you may have more than one secret level in your game, provided that the following criteria 
are adhered to:

     1. Each level containing an exit to a secret level must have an alternate level defined that is separate
         from the logical next level.

     2. The secret level pointed to must have a next level and an alternate level that are the same as the
         next level of the level containing the exit to the secret level.  (This may not be true.  I haven't
         tested it yet, but it's possible that the return point may be setable, allowing many ÔjumpŐ points
         in the game.)

     3. Any level that is secret that is not the last level of the game must be skipped by the next previous
         level that continues the game beyond the secret level.

     4. The end game level must have as its next and alternate levels $FFFF.  Any level containing $FFFF as
         the next and alternate levels does not require an exit if Hitler is present.  If Hitler is not present, an
         exit must exist.  If no Hitler is present and an exit exists, then the word 'VICTORY' is displayed upon
         exit, and the level score screen will be displayed following that.  If Hitler is present and no exit exists,
         the word 'VICTORY' is displayed when Hitler is killed (or the FIRST Hitler, in the case of some levels
         created with WolfEdit) and the level score screen is displayed upon pressing the spacebar or
         clicking the mouse.  This means that some collectibles may not be picked up because Hitler was killed
         prior to picking them up.

     5. If you are creating the levels with WolfEdit, you must observe the following.  If you edit the Map List
         resource in the WolfEdit file with ResEdit (or some other resource editor) to reflect the Next and Alt
         levels, when you install the levels, the FFFF Next and Alt level designations will be changed by WolfEdit
         to whatever the next level is.  (Ie, if the last level is a secret level, and would be level 9 in the Next
         level field, WolfEdit will change FFFF FFFF to 0009 0009.)  You will then have to edit the Map List
         resource in the game (or Episode file if installing into one) and change that reference back to FFFF
         FFFF.  It saves a step to install the levels first, then edit the Map List resource to reflect the levels.

If Episode 1 was modified so that level 1-5 became a secret level reached from Level 1-3, the Map List would look like this:

     Total Levels  ID of First Level
     000A          00C8

     Next  Alt   Par   Floor  Level
 00  0001  0009  003C  0001   0001
 01  0002  0002  004B  0001   0002
 02  0003  0004  003C  0001   0003  <-- Notice Alt Level is now 4
 03  0005  0005  003C  0001   0004  <-- Notice that Next and Alt Levels are now 5
 04  0003  0003  0069  0001   0005  <-- Notice that Next and Alt Levels are now 3
 05  0006  0006  0069  0001   0006
 06  0007  0007  0069  0001   0007
 07  0008  0008  005A  0001   0008
 08  FFFF  FFFF  0096  0001   0009
 09  0001  0001  00C3  0001   0000

This, in combination with a lift added to Level 1-3 with a code of $65 in the Object List section of the level map resource, will make Level 1-5 a 2nd secret level.


A note to Greg Ewing (if anyone can forward this to him I'd be grateful):

For adding the secret level access, simply make it where the next and alternate levels default to the next one unless a $65 item is placed.  On the level in which 
the item is placed a dialog will have to be displayed informing the user that a secret level lift has been placed, and prompting for a level number to use for that 
level.  If the level doesn't yet exist, inform the user that the level must be created for it to work correctly, and if the level doesn't exist when saving and/or 
quitting, inform the user that the level doesn't exist.  The user can be allowed to input level according to the floor-level format (ie. 1-5, for example) and WolfEdit 
can then resolve it's location in the map list.

For end game level, include a checkbox in the level's get info for 'make last level'.  If no level has the box checked, the last level in the set is given the $FFFF 
game end token.  Otherwise, the level with the box checked is given the $FFFF game end token.  Of course, there will have to be checking to see if the last level 
is a secret level, and if so, make the previous level the end game level.

To allow for adding secret level lifts, you need only to allow a maximum of 2 lifts per level.  If one lift has been placed, it automatically becomes the normal 
exit.  If a second one gets placed, it automatically becomes the secret level exit.  You could also add code to allow the user to switch the codes if 2 exits exist 
on a level, and the user wishes the first to be secret level and the 2nd to be next level.

About Hidden Passages

The secret blocks which move back when you push on them involve special arrangements in the map, object table and BSP tree.  In the map, the location of the secret 
block is an empty space, and the area to which it leads is part of the same room as the area it leads from.

An object with code $62 is placed at this location: this is the object you operate when you push on the block.  The object table entry for this object has an extra 
byte appended, containing the wall code which would otherwise have been placed in the map at that location.

The secret block has two segments associated with it.  One of them is positioned on the outside of the block in its initial position, facing towards the player as 
he stands in front of the block ready to push it.  The other segment is positioned on the other side of the block, but facing in the same direction - in other words, 
it is in the place the first segment would end up after the block had been pushed one map cell.  Byte 4 of both these segments refer to the block's initial location.


It is also necessary to place an ordinary block of the same type two cells away in the direction of motion, i.e. in the place where the secret block will end up 
after it has been pushed.  If this is not done, not only will the block vanish after opening, but for some strange reason it may not display properly in its initial 
position.

ACGW: The level I used for testing showed 4 segments per secret door, two as described by Greg, and two for the sides of the adjacent walls on either side of the 
secret door facing the cell (facing each other) where the secret door resides originally. 

Also note that the segments associated with doors and secret doors do not always occur consecutively in relation to the door that they are associated with.  In the 
test level the segments were arranged as follows:
 
     Entry #    Segment          Description        Door # (Associated Door#)
     16         Door Jamb        Facing West        (4)

Here is the Segment List from the test level I used.  Pay special attention to the color codes, as they represent the split and face of terminal segments, and the 
split and border of non-terminal segments.  Entries with an * following them are associated with secret doors.  I have also added another version of the list below 
the segment list named Segment List Tree.  This list is the same, except that the entries have been placed in a tree structure so you can see how they relate.

        Blue = non-terminal node east-west split, cell border
   Dark Blue = non-terminal node east-west split, cell center
         Red = non-terminal node north-south split, cell border
    Dark Red = non-terminal node north-south split, cell center
     Magenta = door segments, facing east
Dark Magenta = door segments, facing west
      Violet = door segments, facing south
 Dark Violet = door segments, facing north
      Purple = terminal node column coordinate, facing east
 Dark Purple = terminal node column coordinate, facing west
       Green = terminal node row coordinate, facing south
  Dark Green = terminal node row coordinate, facing north
       Black = entry number
           * = following an entry indictates secret door or adjacent wall segment

This is the Segment List Tree.  It should give you an idea of how the entries point to each other and encompass the entire level.

        Blue = non-terminal node east-west split, cell border
   Dark Blue = non-terminal node east-west split, cell center
         Red = non-terminal node north-south split, cell border
    Dark Red = non-terminal node north-south split, cell center
     Magenta = door segments, facing east
Dark Magenta = door segments, facing west
      Violet = door segments, facing south
 Dark Violet = door segments, facing north
      Purple = terminal node column coordinate, facing east
 Dark Purple = terminal node column coordinate, facing west
       Green = terminal node row coordinate, facing south
  Dark Green = terminal node row coordinate, facing north
       Black = entry number
           * = following an entry indictates secret door or adjacent wall segment

to zeros.  The second picture I made by changing the color-coded zeros in relation to the segment table as I first decoded it.

This is what the map looks like according to the map section:

Map Section Notes
xx means no code, or no alternate code.
9E displays the plain door in east-west orientation only.  North-south orientation is a trash sprite.
40-80,A1,A5-C0,E5-FF display a trash sprite, but don't otherwise affect the game.

A2,A3,A4,E2,E3,E4
These codes can be used in any place in the map section where a door (of any type) occurs in the place of the normal door code as long as the object list section 
is left unchanged as far as the door codes are concerned.

This requires more discussion.  Normally, the code for a door in the map section and its corresponding code in the object list have a difference of $90 (ie, the 
difference between $DA and $5A).  If you were to change the door codes in the object list to correspond accordingly to A2,A3,A4 and/or E2,E3,E4, you would have 22,23,24 
and/or 62,63,64, respectively.

Obviously, this wouldn't work in the case of 62 and 64, as these codes are already used for secret door and exit, respectively.  Placing a 62 in the object list 
would cause the door when pushed to act like a secret door with one exception.  The door wouldn't move, you'd only hear the sound of a secret door opening.  Once 
the Ňsecret doorÓ was open, you could then walk through the closed door as though it weren't there at all, and there would be an invisible wall in the room it leads 
to in the spot where a wall block would be if it were really a secret door.  If the 64 were used, pushing on that door would exit the level, or end the game if there 
were no more levels.  In the case of the 62-64, the door would be displayed as a regular door, in spite of whatever type of door it was originally.  If you use the 
63 (or the 22,23 or 24), the only thing that happens is that the door does nothing when pushed (BJ grunts).

In all of the cases, if you have a lift door of the same orientation (ie north-south or east-west) as the door with the 22-24 and/or 63 codes, the lift door will 
be displayed as a plain door, and when pushed will not open that door, but open the first door that has the irregular code in the object list (and A2-A4 or E3 in 
the map section) of that orientation, while also changing that door (the one that opens) to a lift door, regardless of what type of door it originally was.
 
This description can be confusing, so here's a few examples.  All of the examples could use any type of door (DA-E1), not just the ones specified:

     E2 and 62 codes:

     +---+
     | x <---  Position of invisible wall block after pushing door.
     |   |
     +---+
       |
       +-----  Silver-key door using E2 in map section and 62 in object list.
               Displayed as a plain door, when pushed does nothing, but the sound of a secret door opening is
               heard.  After being pushed, invisible wall block is placed in room in the 2nd cell position.

     E4 and 64 codes:

     +---+
     |   |
     |   |
     +---+
       |
       +-----  Gold-key door using E4 in map section and 64 in object list.
               Displayed as a plain door, when pushed exits level or ends game.

     Lift Door with A2-A4 and 22-24 or E3 and 63:

     +---+---+
     |   |   |
     |   |   |
     +---+---+
       |   |
       |   +---  Plain Door using any of the code combinations.
       +-------  Lift Door using E1 in map section and 61 in object list.
                 Lift door is displayed as plain door.  Pushing opens the plain door.
                 Plain door is displayed as lift door.  Opens when real lift door is pushed.
                 Real lift door remains closed.

Additional Sprite Info

There are 174 total sprites (not including walls and doors) in Wolfenstein 3D.  Of these, 36 are identified as objects, 4 as ghosts, 1 as a dead brown guard, and 
12 as other guards and bosses (including both armored and unaromored Hitler).  This is a total of 53 sprites identified out of the 174 total, leaving a massive 121 
sprites not identified.

It is my belief that each of the outstanding sprites can be broken down into the following groups, weapons related animations and enemy related animations.  Based 
on observation, I have been able to determine that the enemies average 7 sprites each for their entire range of motion (walking, firing, wincing, and dying) and 
that the weapons BJ holds average 3 sprites each for animation of the weapon being used.  This makes an approximate total of 102 sprites used for enemy and weapons 
animations, and leaves an outstanding 19 sprites yet unidentified.  It may be that some of the guards or bosses use more than 7 sprites in their animations, and 
perhaps a couple of weapons use more than 3, but I can't say for sure.  Also, there is the animations of the fired artillery.  I believe that the grenades (launched 
from the bazooka) have at least 1 sprite, and probably 3 or 4 sprites, associated with their movement away from BJ, and possibly the same for the flamethrower's 
fireballs.

        12 Enemies       6 Weapons       84 Sprites
     x   7 Sprites     x 3 Sprites     + 18 Sprites
        84 Sprites      18 Sprites      102 Sprites

       174 Sprites       121 Sprites
     -  53 Sprites     - 102 Sprites
       121 Sprites        19 Sprites

While I'm sure that Wolfenstein uses sprites for each part of the animations, I'm at a loss to explain how the dead enemies sprites are identified.  I assume that 
there is some internal code that allows the engine to identify the location in the map of a dead enemy, and which enemy it is, and display the proper sprite at that 
location.  I only know for sure that there are no map codes (outside the dead brown guard) for placing dead enemies in the initial map. 


Addons

ACGW: The only addons that I've seen are the extensions for installing a cheat-code menu and the screen INIT that allows the use of the 320x200 screen setting and 
having it displayed as a 640x400 screen.

WolfenZoom 1.2

ACGW: Here's the documentation included with WolfenZoom:

Wolfenzoom is freeware; distribute anywhere!
Send any comments, flames, proposals or gifts to:
	Bo Lindbergh
	KŠllvŠgen 2
	S-182 34  DANDERYD
  Sweden
If you're lazy, you can use e-mail:
	d88-bli@nada.kth.se

Wolfenzoom is a small INIT that lets you play Wolfenstein 3D at 320x200 with 2x2 pixel replicationŃjust like on a VGA monitor on a PC!
68k native! PowerPC native!
Hardware requirement: a Mac capable of running Wolfenstein 3D at 640x400 with "Use Quickdraw" turned off.
Software requirements: Wolfenstein 3D (obviously!) and System 7 or later.

Instructions:
1. Install Wolfenzoom on your Mac by copying it to the Extensions folder and restarting the machine.
2. Fire up Wolfenstein 3D.
3. Set the screen size to 320 x 200.
4. Turn on "Use Quickdraw".
5. Play!

Special features:
You can select various modes of operation for Wolfenzoom by pressing different modifier keys on the keyboard while Wolfenstein 3D starts up.
     Ą Press the command key for alternate line mode. In this mode, Wolfenzoom only draws every other line to
        the screen. This speeds the game up but looks darker. To erase any shadow image (of the loading progress
        bar, for example) in the undrawn lines, press the command key briefly while playing.
     Ą Press the shift key for interlaced mode. Like alternate line mode except that every other frame is offset
        vertically by one line. This removes the darkening effect but causes motion blur. Povl H. Pedersen
        (pope@imv.aau.dk) suggested this, so blame him if it makes you sick.
     Ą Press the option key to flip the screen horizontally.
     Ą Press the control key to flip the screen vertically.

Horizontal and vertical flipping work independently of each other and of alternate line or interlaced mode.
 
Version history:
  1.0   Initial release.
  1.1   Added the different modes of operation.
  1.1.1 Added blanking to the alternate line mode.
  1.1.2 Fixed a bug with vertical flipping.
  1.1.3 Rewrote the PowerPC code to run better on 603 and 604 chips.
  1.2   Saw the obvious and rewrote the PowerPC code for a major performance boost.

Wolfenstein Cheater 1.1 and WolfenCheat 2.0.1

ACGW: Both of these are essentially the same INIT.  The name was changed on v2.0.1, along with a few alterations, but it is essentially the same as v1.1.  Here's 
the documentation (modified to remove duplication) that was included in each:

You can access all of these without Wolfenstein Cheater (or WolfenCheat 2.0) just by typing in the words.  The list of cheats supported has been taken from a post 
by David Christoffersen on comp.sys.mac.games.  Please let me know if you know of any other cheats and I will add them to the list.  And finally, please send any 
bug reports or reports of incompatibilities.  Thanks to Patrick Gray for rewriting the menu strings (in WolfenCheat 2.0) to make them a little easier to understand.

This system extension has been released as freeware, but I reserve all copyrights to the software and its source code. Please feel free to spread it far and wide.


NOTE: MACPLAY AND ID HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THIS, BLAME ME, NOT THEM, FOR ANY PROBLEMS.

Wolfenstein Cheater 1.1
Wolfenstein Cheater is a system extension which adds an extra menu to Wolfenstein 3D and lets you access all the cheats that I know about.  To work, put the extension 
in the 'Extensions' folder and restart your mac. The extension requires system seven or later to run.

WolfenCheat 2.0

WolfenCheat 2.0 is a system extension which adds an extra menu to Wolfenstein 3D and lets you access all the cheats that I know about. Note that version 2.0 does 
not add any new cheats to the menu (as far as I know there are no new ones).  WolfenCheat 2.0 adds the ability to better locate hidden doors by changing the way 
they are displayed so that they better stand out against the adjoining walls.  To work, put the extension in the 'Extensions' folder and restart your mac. The extension 
requires system seven or later to run.

DISPLAYING HIDDEN DOORS
WolfenCheat 2.0 modifies the maps as they are read into memory so that hidden doors are more visible. Hidden doors are changed to a brick wall . (If the door was 
originally a brick wall it is changed to a blue wall).

Sometimes the door is displayed as garbage (a bunch of jumbled colored squares). This is because the level does not contain any walls of that type and thus has not 
rendered the drawing. This is ok and won't hurt anything and in fact makes it easier to spot the hidden walls.

Here are the currently supported cheats:
burger      = full weapons, yes there is more than the chain gun, full ammo based on how much you can carry.
wowzers     = increase bullet capacity to 999 for bullets, and 99 for others. No better weapons than you already
              have.
ledoux      = no damage to you, and no loss of ammo
iddqd       = same as ledoux, needed to turn it off.
seger       = gives you the keys, not important in demo, but may come in handy later
appleiigs   = tells you where all the secret doors are.  On the map, a secret door is labeled with a picture of your
              head
mccall      = allows you to swtich to the beginning of any of the 3 levels
xuscnielppa = no damage, and refills weapons to current capacity

You should have expected someone would tell these sooner or later, well, I vote for sooner.  True, this does take some (or all) of the challenge out of the game, 
but if you want to just play around these can help.  Enjoy.

p.s if you are wondering how I found these, well I have played the Dos version and Doom so I knew cheat keys were around.  Just opened Wolf 3D with Retreive IT and 
it's great "peek in any file" feature, and went to the end of the file and there was a list of several words etc.  

<Disclaimer> I may not have these exactly right as to what they do, I  tried them a little bit, so this is pretty close, but the keys are right:

burger = full weapons, yes there is more than the chain gun, full ammo based on how much you can carry.
wowzers = increase bullet capacity to 999 for bullets, and 99 for others.  No better weapons than you already have.
ledoux = no damage to you, and no loss of ammo
iddqd = same as ledoux, needed to turn it off.
seger = gives you the keys, not important in demo, but may come in handy later
appleiigs = tells you where all the secret doors are.  On the map, a  secret door is labeled with a picture of your head
mccall = allows you to swtich to the beginning of any of the 3 levels
xuscnielppa = no damage, and refills weapons to current capacity

Hope you enjoy these, If you don't fine.  I like the game, only one thing I would like to have.   Marks on the wall as the bullets bounce off, like in Doom, adds 
a good effect.  Overall good, fast and detailed.

Extras

While I have heard of various hacks to the WolfEdit level editor program, I only have one of them.  If you know of any of the other hacks, and especially if you 
have or can get one of them in their original form, please contact me so that I may include them in this document.

WolfEdit 1.0 and 1.1

ACGW: WolfEdit is the first level editor to come out for Wolfenstein 3D.  It is by Greg Ewing.  While 1.0 had virtually no documentation for use (except the ÔAbout 
WolfEditÉŐ splash screen), two users by the names of Sean Howard and Doug Ingram each have contributed to the documentation on their own.  Their contributions are 
in the chapter named ŇA Little Guide to Making Wolf3D Level FilesÓ (named for the document being made and updated by Sean Howard).

ACGW: WolfEdit 1.1 included documentation in the form of 3 screens of information accessed by choosing ÔAbout WolfEditÉŐ from the Apple menu.

ACGW: Greg has supplied other information through the Usenet News group devoted to Wolfenstein 3D.  Below are encapsulations of his additions to the bulk of Wolfenstein 
knowledge, and WolfEdit.

Several people have reported problems when using a large number of objects or enemies in one level.  Burger Bill has kindly supplied the following information about 
limits in Wolf 3D which may help to clear up these problems.

You can have no more than:

        64 objects or enemies in one room
        64 doors in one level
        64 secret walls in one level
        64 rooms in one level
        200 objects in one level
        127 enemies in one level

If you exceed these limits, you can expect weird things to happen. The next version of WolfEdit will check these limits and warn you if you exceed them.

|> BTW, WolfEdit brings out some funny limitations/bugs in Wolf too!  Ever tried placing a wall or something
|> right behind a door? You don't see it!  Instead, you get to see what's behind it!

That's not actually a Wolf limitation, it's an oversight on WolfEdit's part. If there isn't an empty space next to a wall block, it doesn't bother putting a wall 
segment there, which is sensible, except that I forgot about the case where the thing next to it is a door.

I hope to fix this in a later version.
 
|> Ever been able to look at a secret wall from behind?  It's invisible, but still there.  Or seen it from the side?
|> It doesn't have a side, only a front!

That is a Wolf limitation, it seems. I tried to overcome it by putting segments on the back of secret walls, but that just exchanges one strange behaviour for another: 
you end up with what looks like a wall, but you can walk through it! I.e. if you push the wall, go through, turn around and look back, it looks like the wall is 
still there, but it's not. I decided that was worse...

|> Ever put a secret door that has to move more then two squares backwards?

Secret walls always move exactly two squares - there's no way to alter that.

ACGW: The following are inclusions by me according to observations that I've made.

3rd Encounter Ghosts

3rd Encounter includes 4 extra sprites for, what I call, the pac man ghosts.  The reason I call them this is because that's what they look likeÉ huge versions of 
the 4 ghosts you see in Pac-Man¨!  I have included the codes for these in the revised list below.  2nd Encounter Users:  Don't try to just add the 4 sprites to 2nd 
Encounter!  I don't know what is involved, but I can say that just adding the sprites to 2nd Encounter causes the program to crash when it tries to load the map 
data.  If someone knows the mechanics involved, maybe they can come up with a patch of some kind that will allow adding the ghosts sprites to 2nd Encounter.

Other 3rd Encounter Stuff

2nd Encounter and 3rd Encounter saved games are not compatible.  I've attempted to open a 2nd Encounter saved game with 3rd Encounter and the game reports an incompatibility 
error.  I assume the same to be true of the reverse.  I believe that this is because of what has to be saved in each, as well as the fact that 3rd Encounter uses 
external files for each game's levels, where 1st & 2nd Encounter have that information stored within the game's resources.

WARNING:  WolfEdit DOES NOT create 3rd Encounter external files, nor any of the resources required for them.  Perhaps a future version of WolfEdit may do this, but 
I can't say.  (The hack described below makes this possible, but it is a far cry from being able to select bewteen installation in 1st, 2nd or 3rd Encounters,  plus 
it doesn't allow WolfEdit to CREATE Episode files.)

WolfMaker 1.0 and 2.0

Directions for use
WolfMaker 1.0 generates random levels for Wolfenstein 3D First Encounter.
WolfMaker 2.0 generates random levels for Wolfenstein 3D First and Second Encounters.

System requirements
WolfMaker requires WolfEdit and system 7.0.0 or later.

Quick start
First choose the number of rooms and the difficulty of the level.
Press the button "Create level", the random level is now in the WolfEdit scrap.
Open WolfEdit, create a new level and paste.
After pasting the random map, you have to click with the pen on the new map so that WolfEdit saves change.
To play the random level, use the Install command of WolfEdit.

Parameters adjustement
I do not have Wolf3D Second Encounter.

The adjustement of WolfMaker parameters is very simple.
									- First make a copy of WolfMaker 2.0
									- Open the resource fork of this copy with ResEdit
									- WolfMaker contains 2 resources: "Levl" numbered 129 and "Enem" numbered 128.
 								    The resource "Levl" numbered 128 is used for the First Encounter.
									- The resource "Levl" 129 fixes for every level the number of SS, brown uniforms, Boss...
									   You can modify these parameters. 
									- The resource "Enem" contains for every guard the code and ammunitions you need to kill him. 

Example:"Code of the enemy: 				 						$7170	" ( This is the code of the Blue Boss )
							 "Code of the first ammo needed:	 $2A70 " ( Code of ammunition box )
							 "Nb of first ammo:   											2        " ( You need at least 2 ammunition box to kill the Blue Boss)
							 "Code of the second ammo needed:$2F70	" ( Code of gatling gun )
							 "Nb of second ammo:											1				" ( You need at least 1 gatling gun to kill the Blue Boss)

All item codes you need is written at the bottom of this document.
The total number of guards is limited to 127 and the number of objects is limited to 200.
Warning: WolfEdit1.1 has a bug, 2nd Encounter guards are not guards but objects. So the total number of Second Encounter guards and objects is limited to 200.
Thanks to send me these two resources "Levl" 129  and "Enem" 128.  These resources will be incorporated in the next version of WolfMaker.

Wolf 3D Saved Game Editor will let you change around the information on your saved games. You can give your games extra guns, lives, ammo, whatever. There's loads 
of neat stuff.

Ą Instructions
Double click on the WolfEdit Icon. Use the dialog box to choose what saved game file you want to edit. Edit it. Finish. Press Return. Now play the game, and you'll 
have loads of new stuff.

Ą Problems
This is the first release so there might be some problems.  Mail me.

Ą Mail me
If you have problems, questions, suggestions, ideas for improvements, or just want to thank me... mail me at aschein@vertex.ucls.uchicago.edu. If you feel bad since 
you got this software and didn't pay a thing... monetary donations are welcome. Just send 5 bucks (in my name?) to your local PBS station.

Ą Distribution
This is free. If you use it, send me a mail at aschein@vertex.ucls.uchicago.edu. Maybe make some suggestions. You can give it to whoever you want... just don't modify 
it and then distribute it. Also, don't charge for it (you got to be a sucker to pay). Ask me about anything else. If you want the source code... ask me too. I can

ACGW: The documentation and application don't contain any way to contact the author in case of problems.  Wolfenstein 3D Saved Game Editor v0.4 Release 1 is not 
compatible with 3rd Encounter saved games.  I don't know if it will work with both 1st and 2nd Encounter saved games.

Continued in next Chapter 


Continued from last Chapter

Hacks

ACGW: The following hacks are intended to be used with WolfEdit 1.1.  The ŇLiftsÓ hack can be implemented in 1st, 2nd and 3rd Encounters, whereas the ŇMoreÓ hack 
is a 2nd Encounter only hack  Both hacks are by ÔEFlanery@aol.comŐ.  The ŇMusicÓ hack is for use with 2nd and 3rd Encounters, and is by Lazaro Rojas.

ACGW: These ŇhacksÓ are not really hacks at all; they are merely manipulations of WolfEdit using cicns and map section/object list editing to achieve the result, 
or in the case of the Music hack, just adding more items to the menu and modifying the MUS# resource to match.  The only real hack I've seen is the one that changes 
a portion of the code in the main code resource.  This hack changes the Install and Install InÉ items in the File menu to use 3rd Encounter Episode files instead 
of 1st or 2nd Encounter.  I don't know who came up with this hack originally.  It was included in a copy of Lazaro's Music hack that I found in a 3rd Encounter levels 
file archive by him.

I take no responsibility for any harm you may cause with these files.
I would welcome e-mail at "EFlanery@aol.com"

Make other walls into lifts

Requirements:
  Wolf 3d Ist or 2nd enc.
  Wolfedit 1.1
  ResEdit (be careful and work on copys)

Installation:
  put the file "lift control" into the same folder as "wolfedit"

How to use:
  Create your levels as usual
  Place the funny little red double arrow directly above the block that you want to be the lift
    (you can place it to either side or on top, but I will let you figure out what to do next)
  Save, but DO NOT INSTALL
  Open your file using resedit
  Open the BRGR Picker
    -Open res# 200
    -do a hex search for "50"
    -when it hilites "50" change it to "64"
    -select the byte directly before it and add one to it
  Repeat the -ed steps for each res with an id between 200 and 299
  Close picker, select the BRGR reses and choose copy from the edit menu
  Open the copy of wolfenstein that you want to install into with resedit
  Choose paste from the edit menu and answer yes to the question
  Quit resedit saving the copy of wolfenstein, but not your level file
  Enjoy!!
 
ACGW: As an additional note, if you wish to place the object to the right or left of the block, you must change the 1st byte of the 3-byte object in the object list 
to value+1 (if the object is to the left) or value-1 (if the object is to the right).  By the same token, you can place it below the block, but the changes will 
be a little different.  You will still change the 2nd byte of the 3-byte object code to value-1, but this changes the row in which the object is found.  Since the 
object list is arranged in rows, you'll have to select the 3-byte code (all 3 bytes), cut them from their current location, and find the position in the previous 
row to paste them in.  They MUST be placed in the correct position.  I don't know what would happen if the object list was out of order, but I daresay that Wolfenstein 
would crash, or at the very least, some wierd behavior would be experienced.

notes:
Ą NOT COMPATABILE with wolf 3d first or wolfedit 1.0
Ą That green/gray X is a wall that looks like the outside(day from top/bottom, night from side), however it WILL NOT work with the secret passage (wolfedit will 
let you place an arrow on the wall, but wolfenstein will crash.
Ą Certain combinations of sleeping bosses and walls will cause unusual graphics on the walls (it's harmless)
 
ACGW: There is a reason why the above items have to be dealt with in this manner.  Primarily, it is because of the way in which WolfEdit places walls and objects. 
 Internally, WolfEdit places all objects that translate into $80 or higher into the map section (even though there is no wall for the code $80), and all objects 
that translate into $7F or lower into the object list.  Since the enemies listed above translate to $80-$89, WolfEdit places the code in the map section, making 
a wall out of them.  (Also, the codes $81-$89 are valid wall codes, and so cicns already exists in the positions (IDs) that the enemies would require.)  In the case 
of the Landscape, the Lift Controls object is placed in the position that the Landscape would normally occupy, and any other item placed here will still result in 
an $8F being placed in the map section and a $64 in the object list.  Essentially, WolfEdit will have to be revised to incorporate checking for items that can either 
be walls or objects according to their code before this can be resolved.

Greg actually uses a simple manner of identifying the codes.  The cicn ID is the value of the code + 5000.  5144, for example, is 144 ($90) + 5000.  $90 is the code 
used in WolfEdit to identify the Lift Control.  $90 is also the code used in Wolfenstein to identify the Landscape.  What Greg could do is to identify a Ônext orderŐ 
cicn for things that have multiple roles.  For example, 6143 could be used for the Lift Control (corresponding to 5143 for the Lift Side Wall), freeing up 5144 for 
the Landscape.  The same could be done for the walls that conflict with the enemies.  6129 through 6137 could be used for the walls that have the code of $81 through 
$89, leaving 5128 through 5137 for the enemies that have the codes $80 through $89.  Other solutions could also be found.

The solution I favor is as follows:

Essentially, the problem is this.  When WolfEdit sees that an item has an object code of $80 or higher, it places the object in the map section of the resource as 
a wall type.  If the object has a code of $7F or less, it is placed in the object list section.  The problem occurs when you have an object that is not a wall, but 
has a code value of $80 or higher.  In the case of the ambush (or sleeping) versions of the enemies and bosses, the code is in the range of $80 to $89.  Without 
an alternative ordering scheme, it might be impossible to overcome this obstacle.  Fortunately, Wolfenstein 3D has just such a scheme for the all codes in the range 
of $81 through $99.  The alternate codes are $C1 through $D9 (respectively).

This leaves 4 other wall types in the range of $9A through $9D.  There are also 3 other wall codes that allow placement of the doors and the door jamb as walls that 
range from $9E through $A0.  With this configuration in mind, it would be possible to have the objects and walls identified separately by simply changing the value 
of the borderline from $80 to $8A.  In other words, all values of $89 and less are object list codes, and all values of $8A and above are map section wall codes.


Wolfenstein 3D will recognize the $C1 through $D9 codes in the map section correctly, and as such the map section could be built using those codes.  Or, the codes 
could be altered to their $81 through $99 counterparts prior to being placed in the map section.  This would enable all of the objects and walls to be used in WolfEdit, 
and allow the user to place them without having to alter the BRGR resources later to correct wrong codes.

The exit control objects can also be dealt with properly in this regard.  These two objects could be separate from any wall association, thereby allowing them to 
have their unique codes (and proper placement in the list of objects), and also allowing users to designate what wall object they wish to use for an exit control. 
 For a normal exit, the object representing the normal exit could be placed on top of a wall object in the same manner that hidden doors are now dealt with.  The 
secret level exit object would be used similarly.  The wall object with the exit object on it would have the wall placed in the map section, and the exit object 
placed in the object list section.
 
The only caveats that need to be heeded are that there are a maximum of 2 exits per level; one normal and the other secret, and that the Map List resource needs 
to be built differently.  These caveats are already covered in The (Almost) Complete Guide to Wolfenstein 3DŞ under the heading ÔExit Lift to Secret LevelŐ in the 
ÔLevel Resource Description, Part 1Ő chapter.

Music Menu

ACGW: by Lazaro Rojas.  Lazaro didn't include any documentation on the hack, as it was supplied with various WolfEdit 2nd Encounter levels files.  However, installation 
and use are easy to understand.

Use:
This hack is a ResEdit resource file that adds the other music entries to the Level Music popup menu in the level Get Info dialog in WolfEdit 1.1.  It enables you 
to select music for your level other than the ones built-in to WolfEdit.

Installation:
Ą Using ResEdit (or another resource editor), open the resource file and WolfEdit 1.1
Ą Copy the MENU and MUS# resources from the resource file to WolfEdit (overwriting the existing
   resources)
Ą Close both files, saving WolfEdit, and quit the resource editor

Other Hacks

ACGW: Lazaro mentioned to me in email about other hacks.  He includes with his 3rd Encounter levels a ResEdit resource file that includes his Music hack, as well 
as some other hacks that add additional items to WolfEdit.  Here is the email that we exchanged where he describes the various hacks:

  To:             Wayne Campbell
I'm sorry I haven't replied earlier, but I haven't signed on to LAMG in over a week.

The hack with cicn resources I included with my levels does replace the "Some 2nd Encounter Items".  I didn't write it myself, but made it by putting together "Some 
2nd Encounter Items" and a couple of other hacks which included the 3rd Encounter items such as the ghosts and the false doors.  The only hack I wrote is the music 
one.

Cicn #5059 is a dead brownshirt.  I think the only place it appears is right at the beginning of "Escape from Wolfenstein".  That game starts just after you've killed 
a guard in your jail cell, and you can see the dead guard lying on the floor in front of you.  I didn't find this sprite; it was one of the cicn's in one of the 
hacks I mentioned above.
 
I recently came across a hack on AOL for adding additional items to Wolfenstein levels, including sleeping dogs, blueshirts, bosses, mutants, Schabbs, and Hitler, 
as well as the daytime/nighttime landscapes.  The only way to use them, though, is to change some of the values in the actual BRGR resource for each level, a tedious 
process.  And the hack was created for 2nd Encounter, not 3rd.  I tried using it with 3rd, but it didn't work, and the game crashed every time.  However, I did find 
a way to use the daytime/nighttime landscapes, and informed the author of the hack.  The cicn's you uploaded don't correspond to the ones that came with this hack. 
 For instance, the ID# of your sleeping blueshirt is 5124, but the one in the hack is 5065, and 5124 is used for the red ghost.  Your sleeping mutant is 5125, but 
the one in the hack is 5067.  And your landscape is 5128, while the one in the hack is 5158.  I made a copy of WolfEdit 1.1 and pasted your cicn's in it, then made 
a small test level using those sprites, but it didn't work.  The landscape showed up as the type of pixel garbage secret doors show up as, and instead of the sleeping 
blueshirt, the red ghost appeared.  How did you find the ID numbers for your cicn's?  

As for displaying the sprites and walls directly from the BRGR resource, I wish I knew of a way to do this, but unfortunately I don't.  I'd be very interested in 
creating my own wall textures and objects, in addition to creating textures for the floor and ceiling (I hate all that featureless grey!).  On top of that, I'd love 
to alter the characters as well.  Hopefully, someone might come up with a program to do all this, like the ones for Marathon.

I figured this out after writing to you.  I had always wondered about these sprites.  I assume that there must also be sprites for dead versions of the other guards 
and bosses as well.  I'd like to get those some day too.

Really?  I've been waiting for those to come along.  I well know about the process of changing values.  That was how I determined the values of the items in the 
3rd cicn resource file.

Well, I thought I clarified in the upload, but maybe I didn't.  I didn't determine WHERE the cicn's went in WolfEdit 1.1.  I used item IDs that weren't in current 
use in the version of WolfEdit that I have.  I was hoping that someone could forward my observations to the author of WolfEdit so that he could make the proper determinations 
of placement of the cicn's in WolfEdit, as well as possibly determining some of the other problems, such as the yet unidentified mutant and blueshirt guards showing 
up as other things instead of question marks.  I used the original 30 levels of Wold 3D 2nd encounter to determine the values of the characters in the BRGR resource. 
 I also compared these with 3rd encounter and found that they were the same values as 2nd encounter.  I also determined the values for the 4 ghosts in 3rd encounter. 
 However, I don't remember if I included these in my upload, as I believe that I determined them after originally creating the cicn's and uploading them elsewhere. 
 I just uploaded a copy of the same archive to LAMG.  I need to go back and see what needs updating now, since I have more information (including revising the cicn 
item IDs for the new items that you have provided).

To reiterate, of the 3 resource files in my upload, the first is replacement cicns for WolfEdit 1.1.  The 2nd file is replacement cicns for Some 2nd encounter items. 
 The 3rd file is the other items I identified in the BRGR resources that were as yet unidentified as far as WolfEdit is concerned.  These cicn's were NOT intended 
to be pasted into the current version of WolfEdit, but rather forwarded to the author of WolfEdit so that he could figure out where to place them, and how to identify 
them in the BRGR level resources.

There should also be a text file in the archive,  unless I forgot to include it.  It should state the values (in hex) of all of the items that I identified in the 
BRGR resources, as well as the problems with display of these items in WolfEdit.  (Example, the 'sleeping' mutant shows up as a gray stone wall with embossed eagle 
in WolfEdit.)  If it's not there, I will reupload the archive with all information updated.

  To:             Wayne Campbell
I no longer have the original copies of all the Wolfenstein hacks I've found (except for the one I sent you earlier today) because I've incorporated all of them 
permanently into a copy of WolfEdit 1.1.  

As for saving the levels, the only way to save them into 2nd Encounter is with an unmodified copy of WolfEdit.  The code resource of the unmodified version contains 
the string APPL, allowing it to install levels into the game application.  The hack just changes the APPL to MAPS so it can install into 3rd Encounter level files. 
 As far as I know, levels created with the modified WolfEdit will install in both 2nd and 3rd Encounter, but they have to be installed in 2nd with an unmodified 
version.  So you can create levels for either 2nd or 3rd with the modified WolfEdit, and owners of 2nd Encounter can install them into their games with an unmodified 
WolfEdit.

I'm not sure what the actual size of the 3rd Encounter mission pictures is in pixels. I simply copied one of the originals, pasted it into my paint program and erased 
everything but the black outline, and I use this outline for every new picture I make.  As far as I know, you can't make a larger or smaller picture, because it 
won't show up properly.  In fact, I found that pasting in a new one doesn't work unless you include a 1-pixel perimeter of white space around the black outline. 
 The first time I tried it, I tried pasting in the new picture and the outline, and it didn't work properly.  So I pasted an original picture into my paint program 
again, and while it was still selected, I realized the selection area included this white space around it instead of being right on the black outline.

-- L

P.S. I just checked, and the size of the picture is 96x64.  

ACGW: The APPL to MAPS hack, as I understand it, will change the CODE resource in WolfEdit 1.1 to install the levels into a 3rd Encounter Episode file instead of 
into 1st or 2nd Encounter.  (I have installed this hack, and it works, but you can't install into 1st or 2nd Encounters with it, so you'll have to keep a copy of 
the original without this hack to install into 1st or 2nd Encounters with.)

The other hacks simply add the cicns from More 2nd Encounter items file to WolfEdit (thereby making it unneccessary to say ÔYESŐ to the load them prompt), and also 
add the objects from 3rd Encounter (ghosts) and the sleeping guards, dog, and bosses.  Also, once these cicns are all copied into WolfEdit, you can remove the More 
2nd Enc items file from the WolfEdit folder, and WolfEdit won't prompt you anymore.

WolfEdit cicns

This is a series of 3 ResEdit resource files that include replacement cicns for WolfEdit.  I created them when I made the 1st and 2nd Encounter level map PICTs that 
I have made available on InterPlay BBS, LAMG BBS, MVOL BBS, Digital Warehouse BBS, and (soon) Channel Z BBS.

They are 16x16 pixel cicns in 256 colors.  They were made by taking screenshots of the various items in the game, and reducing them to the 16x16 pixel size.  (Of 
course, a few of them required slight modification to get the effect.)  The wall and plain door cicns were taken from the map that is displayed in the game.  (All 
screenshots were taken in 640x480 mode to get the greatest resolution.)

The only items not included in the above description are the guards, bosses (except the blue boss on Level 1-3 of 1st and 2nd Encounter), and ghosts.  There are 
3 files:  WolfEdit cicns (for the cicns in WolfEdit), Some 2nd Enc Items cicns (for the external file), and Other cicns (sleeping guards and bosses, and ghosts, 
and landscape).

Since I created these files, I found out about the other hacks, and have updated them to include the correct cicn ID #Ős to correspond with the hacks.  The archives 
I have already released don't reflect this change.  Channel Z will be the first BBS to receive the updated archive.  Also, I have now created cicns for all of the 
dogs, guards and bosses.  This means that all of the objects shown in WolfEdit now have a 256 color representation derived from screenshots of the objects in the 
game.

I have decided, since all of the ÔhacksŐ I found out about are so easy to install and use, to include all of the cicns in one file, with the appropriate ID numbers, 
and include a separate text file documenting the installation and use of all of the objects.  I'm even including the modified code resource to allow installation 
of levels into 3rd Encounter Episode files.  This way, all of the hacks (and my versions of the cicns) will be together in one place for those who don't have the 
resources to look all over to find different hacks.

I have called the file WolfEdit Hacks.  It has it's own accompanying document (a SimpleText file) that explains everything about it.  I'm including the doc file 
here so that this document is up-to-date.
 
WolfEdit Hacks
WolfEdit Hacks.rsrc is a ResEdit resource file that includes the following:

     Ą  Replacement CICN resources for all objects and walls, including the objects for start position,
         and the hack object for making other objects (walls) into lift controls.

     Ą  Replacement MENU and MBAR resources for the walls, doors and objects.

     Ą  Replacement Music MENU and MUS# resource for the Level Music popup menu.

     Ą  Replacement CODE resource for installing levels into 3rd Encounter Episode files.

     Ą  RMAP and TMPL resources for viewing some of the BRGR resources.

CICN Resources
These cicns are 256 color and represent all of the objects, walls, and enemies in Wolfenstein 3D.  There are also four cicns included as replacements for the Ôman 
holding a gunŐ cicns that represent start position, as well as a replacement cicn for the Ômake other objects lift controlsŐ cicn that is one of the ÔhacksŐ for 
WolfEdit.  The cicn IDs for the Ambush versions of the dog, guards (except Brown SS and White SS Officer), and bosses were derived from another ÔhackŐ.  All of the 
cicns pictures were derived from screenshots of the various objects in the game.  The plain door and all other walls (except the lift control panel) were taken from 
screenshots of the maps of various levels in the game.  The rest (except the cicn for making other objects lift controls) were made by taking a screenshot of the 
object in the game, creating a black background around it that was (for the most part) square, and then selecting the area and reducing the selection until I achieved 
a 16x16 pixel picture.  The Suit of Armor had a little work done to it, as the reduction seemed to make it look like garbage instead of a suit of armor.  The Ômake 
other objects lift controlsŐ cicn was made by redoing the original cicn.  ClarisWorksŐ Paint application was used to do the work, and ResEdit was used to store the 
resulting pictures into cicn resources.  I've heard of another ÔhackŐ that adds the doors as walls, but haven't seen it.  I made my own, and it works.  I've included 
the cicn's for these walls.

Note about the Ambush version enemies and doors as walls hacks.  The cicn's for the Ambush enemies (except the Brown SS and White SS Officer) used cicn id's that 
made it where you had to change the value of the object in the object list from $41, $42, $43, $44, $45, $46, $47, $49, $4A and $4B to $80, $81, $82, $83, $84, $85, 
$86, $88, $89 and $87 (respectively).  This order doesn't concur with the order of the enemies, and is also more difficult to remember.  I determined that an order 
of $4x -> $8x would be easier to understand, and easier to remember.  Since the floor codes are $00-$3F, this was easy to accomplish.  The cicn's I've included use 
IDs that will make the objects occur in the following order: From: $40, $41, $42, $43, $44, $45, $46, $47, $48 and $49 To: $80, $81, $82, $83, $84, $85, $86, $87, 
$88 and $89.  I've also included a cicn for what I believe to be an Ambush version of the Green Pac Man ghost.  It's code will show up in the object list as $4B. 
 It should be changed to $8B.  There are no Ambush versions of the Red, Yellow or Blue ghosts, or cicns of the dead versions of any of the other enemies (besides 
the Brown SS guard) as there are no codes for them.

The doors as walls cicns use id's that produce the codes $9F, $A0 and $A1 in the map section of the resource.  The codes actually are $9E, $9F and $A0, respectively. 
 The doors show up as follows:

     From    To      Door Description
     $9F  -> $9E     East/West facing Plain Door
     $A0  -> $9F     East/West facing Silver Key Door & North/South facing Gold Key Door
     $A1  -> $A0     East/West facing Door Jamb & North/South facing Lift Door

I would've liked to make it where all of the cicns produced the correct code (without needing to edit the resource), but the code to WolfEdit will have to be revised 
for this to happen.

Using the ÔMake other objects liftsŐ object.  The original hack included the instructions for use, placing the object to the right of the wall.  Note that Ôother 
objectsŐ means walls, not any other objects.  I experimented and found that to place the object on any of the other 3 sides requires different changes.  Below is 
how to use the object to make a lift on any of the 4 sides of a wall object.

Note:  In the object list, the 3-byte entry is designated Row, Column, Object.  In the examples below ÔyyŐ refers to row coordinate, ÔxxŐ refers to the column coordinate, 
and $50 refers to the code used with the ÔMake other objects liftsŐ cicn.  If you don't know how to add a secret level to your levels, DON'T use the $65 code!  Also, 
the use of this code produces an extra room in each level where it occurs when the object is originally placed in a solid wall (surrounded by other wall cells). 
 If placed in a wall that is viewable from another room, it will add an extra floor cell in that room.

1. Wall is on the North:  Place the object in the adjacent cell above the wall cell.  Change the object list entry as follows:  Change the ÔyyŐ coordinate to current 
value + 1 to place the object on the wall cell.  Change the $50 to $64 (or $65 if you want to include an exit to secret level).

2. Wall is on the South:  Place the object in the adjacent cell below the wall cell.  Change the object list entry as follows:  Change the ÔyyŐ coordinate to current 
value - 1 to place the object on the wall cell.  Change the $50 to $64 (or $65 if you want to include an exit to secret level).

3. Wall is on the East:  Place the object in the adjacent cell to the left of the wall cell.  Change the object list entry as follows:  Change the ÔxxŐ coordinate 
to current value + 1 to place the object on the wall cell.  Change the $50 to $64 (or $65 if you want to include an exit to secret level).

4. Wall is on the West:  Place the object in the adjacent cell to the right of the wall cell.  Change the object list entry as follows:  Change the ÔxxŐ coordinate 
to current value - 1 to place the object on the wall cell.  Change the $50 to $64 (or $65 if you want to include an exit to secret level).

MENU, MBAR and MUS# Resources
The MENU resources are the replacement menus for the objects, walls and enemies in the game.  In addition to making the ÔLift ControlsŐ item in the Walls menu active, 
I have added an item for the ÔMaking Other Objects Lift ControlsŐ object.  It occurs in the Walls menu right after the ÔLift ControlsŐ item.  I have reorganized 
the menus, and even renamed one.  The menu titles are:  Walls,  Doors,  Items,  Treasures,  Weapons,  and Enemies.  The Treasures menu, besides containing the four 
treasure items, also contains the keys and health items.  The MBAR resource sets the order of the menus (the way they are placed in the menubar) so that the order 
matches the way I've listed them here.

The Music menu and associated MUS# resource are also included.  This menu will allow you to select from all of the level music resources in Wolfenstein for your 
levels.

CODE Resource
The CODE resource that makes it possible to install levels into 3rd Encounter Episode files is also included.  This resource is the ÔMainŐ resource from WolfEdit 
1.1 that has 4 bytes patched to look for the file type MAPS instead of APPL.  If you install this resource, you won't be able to install levels into 1st or 2nd Encounters, 
so if you still want to be able to do that, save a copy of WolfEdit with the original ÔMainŐ CODE resource intact.
 
RMAP and TMPL Resources
These resources allow you to look at two of the resources in WolfEdit and four of the resources in the BRGR resource with a resource editor instead of the default 
Hex editor in ResEdit.  The first two were made by Lazaro Rojas.  They are the ÔPIC#Ő and ÔMUS#Ő TMPLs.  They are used to look at the PIC# and MUS# resources in 
WolfEdit.  Two of the TMPLs (and the associated entries in the RMAP resource) were created by someone else (I'm not quite sure who), and I got them from Lazaro Rojas. 
 They are the ÔĹĹĹĹŐ TMPL and the ÔÖÖÖÖŐ TMPL.  These templates are linked to the Map List (ÔĹĹĹĹŐ) and Music List (ÔÖÖÖÖŐ) BRGRs.  The last two (and their associated 
entries in the RMAP resource) I made.  They are the ÔWalLŐ and ÔSefLŐ TMPLs, and are linked to the Wall List (ÔWalLŐ) and Sound Effects List (ÔSefLŐ) BRGRs.

Continued in next Chapter 


Continued from last Chapter

Installing the Resources
To install the resources you want, use ResEdit (or another resource editor) to open a copy of WolfEdit 1.1 and WolfEdit Hacks.  If you want everything, simply select 
all of the resources in WolfEdit Hacks, copy them (from the EDIT menu), and paste them into WolfEdit 1.1.  When you are prompted to either use unique IDs, replace 
same IDs, or stop, choose replace same IDs.  Save WolfEdit 1.1 and quit.  You're now ready to use the updated WolfEdit 1.1.  If you are using the CODE resource, 
but still want to use the unmodified version (of that resource) for installing into 1st or 2nd Encounter, simply install all of the resources except the CODE resource 
into another copy of WolfEdit.  You might want to consider a naming convention so that you can remember which one is 3rd Encounter and which one is 1st and 2nd Encounter. 
 I used WolfEdit 1.1 (1st & 2nd Encs) and WolfEdit 1.1a (3rd Enc).  You can now also remove the More 2nd Enc Items file from the WolfEdit folder, since it's no longer 
necessary (and the prompt for it will go away).  Also, double-clicking a WolfEdit levels file seems to always run 1.1a on my system (the 3rd Enc installer), so I 
have to run WolfEdit 1.1 (1st & 2nd) and load the levels file from the File menu if I want to install the levels into 1st or 2nd Encounter.  You may see similar 
results.

Cicn IDs 1 to 7 are NOT to be copied to WolfEdit.  If you copy all resources, be sure to delete these from WolfEdit before you save and close.  These cicns are included 
as alternatives to the cicns I have used for those items.  The items are the daytime/nighttime landscape (5158) and the lift wall/control panel (5143).  Since each 
of these will produce a different wall in east/west orientation than the wall produced in north/south orientation, I decided it was best to use a split picture (half 
is one wall, the other half is the other wall).  I placed the day/night split cicn in the active cicn (5158) used in WolfEdit, but left the lift wall (5143) as the 
lift wall.  I thought that some of you may not like the way I had them, so I give you alternatives.  For the day/night, I give you night/day (3), just day (1), and 
just night (2) to choose from.  For the lift wall, I give you four options, lift wall/control panel (4), control panel/lift wall (5), lift wall (top)/control panel 
(bottom) (6), and control panel (top)/lift wall (bottom) (7). 


                                           WolfEdit 1.0 FAQ - Version 3

There are some questions that several people have asked about WolfEdit 1.0, so it looks like it's time for a small FAQ.

Contents:
0 Where is the flamethrower, etc?
1 How do I set the starting position?
2 How do I create a lift?
3 Why does Wolfenstein run out of memory when I complete a level?
4 How do I work around number 3?
5 Why are the icons in the Apple and Application menus half size?
6 Why do some of my guards and objects become invisible?
7 Why can I sometimes see objects through walls?
8 Why does WolfEdit crash when I fill a large area?
9 Why does WolfEdit crash when I try to save or install?


0 Where is the flamethrower, etc?
In the Second Encounter, which WolfEdit doesn't support yet.


1 How do I set the starting position?
Use one of the four "man pointing a gun" icons in the top left corner of the palette. Due to an oversight, there are no menu items for these.  The metal plate has 
no connection with the start position other than by convention.


2 How do I create a lift?
Use the Lift Control Panel item. You can only have a control panel which faces east or west - the north or south face will appear as a lift side panel, although 
it will work as a control panel. Similarly, a lift side panel viewed from the east or west will appear as a control panel, but won't work as one.


3 Why does Wolfenstein run out of memory when I complete a level?
Because you used the Get Info... box. Yes, this is a bug: changing anything with the Get Info box messes up the information telling Wolfenstein which level to play 
next.  This will be fixed in the next release.


4 How do I work around number 3?
(a) Don't use the Get Info... command.

(b) If you know how to use ResEdit, you can repair a level which has been damaged by Get Info as follows: Open the level file and find the BRGR resource named "Map 
List". It consists of a 2-word header followed by a 5-word entry for each level.  The first 2 words of each entry should be FFFF FFFF. If they're not, make them 
that way. Then use WolfEdit to re-install the file and all should be well.


5 Why are the icons in the Apple and Application menus half their usual size?
Because I was foolish enough to include a 16x16 cicn resource with and ID of 256 :-( This is Apple's fault, not mine. As far as I know it's a harmless oddity - don't 
worry about it.


6 Why do some of my guards and objects become invisible?
You may have too many rooms, objects or guards in your level. Wolf 3D imposes the following limits:

        64 objects or enemies in one room
        64 doors in one level
        64 secret walls in one level
        64 rooms in one level
        200 objects in one level
        127 enemies in one level

If you exceed these, you can expect weird things to happen.  The next version will check these for you, but in the meantime you'll have to watch them yourself.


7 Why can I sometimes see objects through walls?
This is a bug in Wolf 3D. If an object is close to a wall and you view the wall from a long distance away, it can get confused about which is in front. Moving the 
offending object further away from the wall may
help.


8 Why does WolfEdit crash when I fill a large area?
Because its stack size is too small. Workaround: Don't fill more than about 1/4 of a level at a time.


9 Why does WolfEdit crash when I try to save or install?
Maybe because you have a room that is too big. WolfEdit can also run out of stack space in this situation when you close, save or install a level. Workaround: Don't 
create such big rooms.  According to Burger Bill, this is fixed in the 3rd Encounter.

1. BUGS
    A lot of people on the net have complained about disappearing bad guys, or see-through walls. Well, I've come into contact with a couple of these, and have solutions, 
and never come onto others but have theories.

    According to the level stats, there can be no more than 64 rooms.  You may not think that you'd use up these many, but remember that each room is a space completely 
enclosed on all sides.  That means, that those little one block hallways count as a room.  Might even mean that one square surrounded by blocks is a room, don't 
know.  At any rate, 64 rooms is a lot, and should be all means satisfy most people's needs.  I once tried to make a level which was a bunch of square rooms, and 
went over the 64 room limit.  What happens in that case is the doors that separate the rooms get stuck half open, making the two rooms only one.  You can't walk 
through the broken door, nor open it, but you can shoot through it.

    The invisible wall problem is a very simple one in most cases.  Any secret door can be viewed only on the side that can be pushed.  Well, actually, all sides 
can be pushed, but only the wall is drawn on one side.  So make sure that the secret doors always point away from you, and that you can't get to the other side without 
using the door.

    I have no idea what the problem is with the disappearing bad guys is, but I'm sure it has something to do with the number of objects (not just bad guys, but 
tables, ammo, and flags, etc..) on screen at one time.  It might help if you turn the music off, or use a smaller screen.  On my IIsi, smallest screen, no music, 
I've never seen any bad guys
disappear.

 
2. FUN WITH SECRET DOORS
    Secret doors have got to be the spiffiest thing about Wolf3D.  However, they are also easy to screw up.  I've seen several level files where there is a secret 
door, but no block behind it.  This makes the door move back two spaces, and disappear, but still act as a block.

+--+--=--=--=--=--=--=--+--+  Let's say this is a simple map section.  The -> block is the secret
|->|   XX    [] [] [] []|%%|  door. The XX is where the door disappears and becomes a block. The []
+--+--=--=--=--=--=--=--+--+  is ammo. Because of the funny way secret doors are, the ammo will be
                              able to be seen through the door, but not be able to be gotten. Sucks.

    So try, and put a block 2 blocks behind the door so that the door has something to disappear into.  This also helps level makers make sure that all items are 
gettable, and saves some stupid mistakes.  I once made a level where a door went back into empty space, and it was like a giant invisible wall was there.  This can 
be used for some spiffy effects tho, like putting a secret door over empty space, makes an invisible barrier that can be pushed.

    Also in the fun world of secret doors: Did you know that secret doors can be nested? Really,

+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+  This works!  The player pushes the wall, and can push the one behind
|->|  |->|  |->|  |->|  |%%|  it, and so on.  This is great for tricking the player into thinking
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+  that they've found a secret area, but there are sever other secret
                              areas out beyond it.

    NEVER PUT TWO SECRET DOORS RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. Results are not fun for the game, but create a
    neat effect.

    DON'T PUT SECRET DOORS ON TOP OF OBJECTS, BADGUYS, OR OTHER DOORS.  WolfEdit only saves the door,
    and not the object underneith, so results suck there too.


3. MEAN TRICKS
      A really great trick to really piss off the player is to make the lift a secret door.  After going through a long and grueling battle on the level, and finally 
getting to the lift, and finding out that there is more music to be faced.  Or you can make a fake lift, without the control panels, so it just doesn't work.

    MORE LATER


4. SOME SPIFFY IDEAS
    Split the level into different parts.  There are two different keys, so make the players find one key, then go back and go through a previously locked door, 
and find the other key.  A good obstacle in the way of the yellow key is always the Big Blue Guy(tm).

    MORE LATER

 
5. OTHER MISC TIPS
    Always make the elevators face in an E/W Left/Right direction.  The wall has the controls on the left and right sides, and the elevator gray wall thing on the 
top and bottom sides. So the controls should face the player sideways.

    Don't skimp on ammo. Most players are gonna play to shoot bad guys.  Unless you really want the player to run around with a knife, place lots of ammo, or bad 
guys.  Too much ammo is better than too little.

    Dogs don't give ammo, so put a lot of them on a level short on ammo.  If the player is smart, he/she will use a knife to kill them, or else be out of ammo.  
Plus, they make a cool sound when they die.

From: Sean Howard
Subject: Guide to Making Wolf3D levels
========================================================================================
Getting back to the documentation, I can probably save new users a little time by giving them the following tips:

- Entire games are saved as a single file...you should always start with 1-1 since the game crashes otherwise
  in some cases.  You can't just install a single level into a Wolf application and then still have the rest...when
  you're installing levels, you're installing an entire SET at a time.  As soon as you finish the last level in your
  file, the game ends.

- The first four icons after the blank in the icon list are the four possible "starting positions".  I didn't
  recognize these at first and thought the metal plate was enough to specify a starting position.  The game
  requires starting positions to be designated in all levels.

- When opening a saved file, you can edit your levels by clicking on the level name in the little text window.
  Highlighting one of these enables you to choose options from the Level menu (Open, New Level and Get Info).
  The Get Info option allows you to specify level number (default level num is the next in the sequence...I
  imagine bad things happen if you skip but I haven't tried this) and par time.

ACGW: WolfEdit 1.1 Usage Notes

About WolfEdit
The splash screen in WolfEdit 1.1 has 3 screens of information, as a means of including some rudimentary usage notes.  While it doesn't cover everything (Greg assumes 
you'll be able to understand most things intuitively), it does cover some of the less understood aspects of level creation.

File Menu
The File menu is basically the same as most other File menus.  However, there are two items that need a little explanation.  The splash screen mentions this, but 
doesn't (in my opinion) make it clear without re-reading it a couple of times.  So, for clarity, I include the item descriptions here.

     Install         This item allows you to install all of the levels in the current file into 1st or 2nd
                           Encounters.

     Install InÉ  This item allows you to install one level in the current file into 1st or 2nd Encounters.

Edit Menu
The Edit menu includes the standard items:  Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear.

Levels Menu
The Levels menu includes two sets of items.  The first set is for creating a new level, opening the currently selected level, and setting attributes of a level. 
 The second set is for placement of the starting position in the current level.

     New Level   is always active.  When no level is currently being edited, this item creates a new level and
                           opens it for editing.

     Open Level  is only active whan no level is open for editing, and a level is selected.  If no level is
                           selected, or a level is already open for editing, this item is disabled.

     Get Info       is used to set certain attributes of the selected level.  It is active when a level is either
                          selected or open for editing.  If no level is selected or open for editing, this item is disabled.
                          The attributes settable from Get Info are:

                          1) Level Number (ie 1-5)
                          This item allows you to renumber a level that you have either duplicated or moved (in
                          relationship to the other levels).

                          2) Par Time (in seconds)
                          This item allows you to set the par time of the level (average time it takes to complete the
                          level).  Most people seem to leave this value set to the 60 seconds (1 minute) default valueÉ
                          even the programmers at MacPlay did this with the original levels!  However, Wolfenstein
                          offers a bonus point value for beating par time.  The amount of the value is determined by
                          how much faster than par you completed the level.  Most of the time, this bonus is ignored,
                          because of the fact that the par time set for the level is absurdedly low for that level.  As a
                          matter of fact, in some of the levels in the original game, even knowing exactly where the
                          exit is (and exactly how to get there), I couldn't complete the level in less than 3 or 4
                          minutes.  This gets expounded when you have to go out of your way to find gold and/or silver
                          keys that are required to reach the exit.

                          I suggest playing a created level a few times to see what the average time it takes you to
                          complete it is (ie, 3 times, average 5 minutes rounded).  Once you have an average,
                          determine (as realistically as possible) where you stand on an ability scale of 1 to 10.  This
                          scale is essentially your ability to navigate the game.  A Ô1Ő is a poor player (lack of
                          coordination, etc.).  A Ô10Ő is lightning fast reflexes, ability to sail around corners, kill the
                          offenders with as few shots as possible, etc.  If you fall in the catagory of 1 to 5 on the scale,
                          (and your time to complete the level will probably be at least 3 minutes on a simple level),
                          subtract the scale number from the par time (in minutes).  If the remainder is less than 1,
                          leave the par time set to the default, otherwise calculate the number of seconds equal to the
                          remainder (as minutes) and set the par time to that number (ie  par time = 5 minutes,  scale
                          = 3, 5 minutes - 3 = 2 minutes, 2 minutes * 60 seconds = 120 seconds).
 
                          3) Level Music     (in a popup menu)
                          This popup menu allows you to select which music the selected level will use.  An unmodified
                          version of WolfEdit shows the following items available:

                                                     Title
                                                     Between Levels
                                                     Level 1
                                                     Level 3

                          2nd and 3rd Encounters gave some interesting names to the level music items.  All told, there
                          are eight music items.  Besides the above, there are Level 2, Level 7, Level 8, and Level 9.
                          The unique names given to the Level x items are:

                                                     Level 1     Plodding
                                                     Level 2     Grunge
                                                     Level 3     Unleashed
                                                     Level 7     Rocked
                                                     Level 8     Original
                                                     Level 9     Doom

                          There are modified menus (and associated MUS# resources) available that will add these
                          other music items to the popup menu.

Walls, Furniture, Items, Treasures, Enemies and Doors Menus
These menus contain most of the items in the cicn list (top of the window).  They are linked to the cicn list, in that when you select a cicn the associated item 
in one of the menus is checked, and when you select an item from one of the menus the associated cicn is selected.  However, the original menus are incomplete, and 
the Lift Controls item in the Walls menu is inactive.  There is no menu item for the floor space (the ÔblankŐ cicn in the upper left corner of the window).

In the replacement cicns (and hacks) file I have compiled, I have included replacements for these menus.  The main differences are the organization.  The menus I 
include are:  Walls, Doors, Items, Treasures, Weapons and Enemies.

     The Walls menu includes all of the walls, as well as the Lift Controls (active), and the Other Lifts object.
     The Doors menu includes all of the doors, including secret doors.
     The Items menu includes all of the objects that don't fit the catagories as established by the other menus.
     The Treasures menu is somewhat misleading.  While it includes all 4 treasures and the Extra Life object,
      this menu also includes the keys, and all of the health-related items:  Water Puddle (yes, this is
      health-relatedÉ if your health drops below a certain point, you can ÔdrinkŐ the water by walking over the
      puddle), Dog Food, Chicken Dinner and First Aid Kit.
     The Weapons menu includes all of the weapons, ammunition types and the Ammunition Back Pack.
     The Enemies menu includes all of the enemies, including all bosses, guards and dogs and ambush (sleeper)
      enemies, plus the dead guard. 
	  
	  
Foreward
When I registered the 1st Encounter game and received the 2nd Encounter game, I already knew that I wanted the 3rd Encounter game.  When I finally received the 3rd 
Encounter game, I had already found out about the commercial 90-level game.  In checking it out, I found out that the commercial game was essentially 2nd and 3rd 
Encounters in one game.  I had ResEdit, so I decided to see how difficult it would be to add the 2nd Encounter levels to the 3rd Encounter game.  It turned out to 
be even easier than I thought it would be.

Ę












Adding Wolfenstein 3DŞ 2nd Encounter Levels to Wolfenstein 3DŞ 3rd Encounter
So, you've gotten 2nd Encounter and 3rd Encounter, and you want to add the levels from 2nd Encounter to 3rd Encounter so that you don't have to keep 2 huge games 
on your hard drive at the same time!

Have no fear, the answer is here!  Wolfenstein 3DŞ 3rd Encounter uses external files (known as Episode Files) to store the data for the levels so that each episode 
is usable separately (avoiding having to have so many levels in memory at once).  These episode files have a creator code of WOLF and a file type of MAPS.

Ę
















If you don't have a resource editor such as ResEdit, you won't be able to do this, but for those of you who do, here's what to do to add the 2nd Encounter levels 
to 3rd Encounter.

NOTE:  The following assumes you are using ResEdit.  You'll have to adapt if you're using another resource editor.

Create an Episode File
First, create a new resource file in the Levels folder in the Wolfenstein 3DŞ folder (or whatever you've named the folder that 3rd Encounter lives in).

Ę









Before doing anything else, Get File Info on the new untitled file you just created and change the file type to MAPS (case specific) and the creator code to WOLF 
(case specific).  While you are there, name the file something unique (I named mine 7 Castle Wolfenstein, using the file naming convention used by Wolfenstein). 
 Set the No INITs  checkbox so that it is marked.  NOTE: The Inited  checkbox will be handled by the Finder, so don't worry about setting it.  Now close the info 
window and save the changes.

Ę























 
Create Some Resources
Next, it is time to create some resources.  The levels files used by Wolfenstein 3DŞ contain 2 resource types; BRGR and PICT.

Ę







The PICT Resource
We'll deal with the PICT resource first.  The PICT resource contains one item: the picture that will be displayed in the episode selection window in Wolfenstein 
3DŞ when you hilite the selection.  I'm no artist, so I just used the same PICT resource that is contained in the file 1 Escape from Wolfenstein.  You may do this 
also, or you can create a PICT to use yourself.  The size of the picture rectangle is 96x64.  The rectangle area includes a 1-pixel white space around it instead 
of being right on the black outline.  (Thanks to Lazaro Rojas for this information.)

Ę















One thing, though.  The PICT in the resource item must have an ID of 1, and must contain a name.  The name is used to add the entry to the list of available games 
in the episode selection window of Wolfenstein 3DŞ.  I gave mine the same name as the file I created (again following the naming convention used by Wolfenstein 3DŞ); 
7 Castle Wolfenstein.

Ę








The BRGR Resource
Next, we need to create the BRGR resource.  First, copy the resource item Signature from one of the other levels files, or create one yourself.  The resource item 
has an ID of 1, and a name of Signature (case specific), and contains the following text string (case specific): Wolf 3D (don't forget the space between Wolf and 
3D).  If you create this resource item, you'll have to create the resource itself, so specify a resource type of BRGR.  Copying the Signature item from one of the 
other levels files will create the resource type for you.

Ę























Next, open the resource fork to Wolfenstein 3DŞ 2nd Encounter, and open the BRGR resource.  You'll need to copy the following resource items from here to the new 
file:

 ID    Name
-----  ---------------------
 135   Sound effect list
 137   WallList
 145   GamePal
 146   Map list
 147   Music List
 200   Map0
  .
  .
  .
 229   (Map29, though not named in the resource)

The Sound effect list (135), WallList (137),  GamePal (145), and Music List (147) resource items don't HAVE  to be copied.  Wolfenstein 3D 3rd Encounter already 
includes these resource items.  I state them here, and advise copying all relevant resources, to maintain convention with the design of the original episode files.

 
Ę

















































Once you've copied these resource items to the new file, close the 2nd Encounter file, and close and save the new file.

You're Done

You're done.  Try it out!  You'll see a 7th game added to the episode selection window, and if you select it, you'll see the PICT that you placed in the PICT resource. 
 And when you play, you'll think you're playing the 2nd Encounter game (because you are!).
