1939!!!	It's 1939 the start of WWII.  You are sent into a German Fortress, to take out the fortress leader, who happens to be a high ranking official in Hitler's Gestapo.  You have to fight through ten floors of packed emenies then succesfully take out the leader.  He has never lost a battle and so haven't you.  You can defeat him by finding the secrets throuhout the fortress and load up to take him out.Good Luck!
