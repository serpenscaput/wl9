A fairly interesting entry in the Mac modding family tree, 1939 brings you on a mission deep inside the German heartland, apparently years before the United States and Third Reich officially crossed paths in the war. There are ten maps, and while the designs can get repetitive (no doubt due to the overall short build time), the game is worth checking out.
