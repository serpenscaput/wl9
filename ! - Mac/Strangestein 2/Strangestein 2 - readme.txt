The Strangestein mods are an interesting entry in the Mac history of modding. As is often the case, little is known about them. Made by George Rodriguez (a fairly active modder at the time, responsible for such massive hits as Bin Ladenstein), they don't come with much in terms of documentation or storyline. One is certain though: you find yourself a stranger in a strange land, facing an eclectic ensemble of enemies among curious environments with reversed Nazi swastikas and wa-a-acky sounds.

While the first Strangestein is rather odd, having only one map that doesn't even feature all of the new content, Strangestein 2 is the proper mod here, bringing fourteen new maps and a bunch of new sounds alongside even more graphic changes and new interface elements. Enjoy.
