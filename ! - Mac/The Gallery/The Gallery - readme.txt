The Gallery, a 10-level Third Encounter scenario by Mike Hunter. The storyline is the tried and true "the war is coming to an end so go kill Hitler". Nothing impressive here. So why is this mod notable?

Well, there are two ways. First of all, notice the title? Where did it come from? It refers to the final level: it's a kind of an art gallery with real paintings made by uncle Adolf on the walls. I don't think I've seen anyting like that in any other mods. And the other way, much smaller but still interesting: this is one of those rare scenarios that make use of secret elevators. There are four secret maps in total (yes, 4 out of 10) and you better find them all. Other than that, mapping is strongly reminiscent of Laz Rojas with perfect symmetry all over the place and lots of guards (in the secret maps especially some rooms are filled to the brim with enemies). But it's a fair challenge: there's always some resources to help you survive.
