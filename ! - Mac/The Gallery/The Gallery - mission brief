There is rumor that the war is near its end.  Hitler has retreated to the fortress which holds the treasures that he has accumulated during his march across Europe.  Your mission is to infiltrate Hilter's well guarded "Gallery" and destroy the artist turned madman.

This 10-level set has secret floors.  You may finish the game with only having gone through 6 levels or it may take all 10.  When you finally get to the gallery, look around.  The paintings on the walls are actual paintings by Adolf Hitler himself before he decided that world conquest was a more prudent endevour.

Good Luck!
