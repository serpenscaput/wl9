Well, here it is. I've been anticipating reactions from this third and final installment ever since I decided to publish these scenarios. I'm still in the midst of fussing over a small detail in Chapter 2, but Chapter 1 is certainly ready. If you liked the other scenarios, I'm sure you'll love it, and it's the one I'm the most proud of. Thank you, as always, for taking the time to play through it! Here are some hints:1. Be sure to read the story before playing. The first map will especially make much more sense that way.2. Look all around for visual clues. There are a handful of wall textures in Chapter 1 whose symbolic meanings will make Chapter 2 much easier!3. You'll need to play at at least 640x400 in order to be able to read important story text.4. Both Chapters have 2 paths through them. However, the paths are only able to intersect in Chapter 2.5. This scenario, like the others, was meant to be played on the easiest setting.I'll do my best to ensure that Chapter 2 is available soon. All I ask is that you have fun!-compyislife
