Relatively early on, still in 2020, we have ported A Madman's Redemption by compyislife, a quirky mod that delves into BJ's mind. Many month have passed, and in the meantime I learned that Redemption is only one part of a series, the remaining instalments being A Madman's Revenge and A Madman's Reprise, both of which come in two Chapters. That's what you're getting here. The whole release thus amounts to four mods for the Third Encounter, 30 maps total.

I said Redemption was quirky and these mods continue the trend. As Mac Wolfenstein does not include any textual intermission screens, compy's scenarios convey their storyline via text placed on wall textures. I won't spoil much of anything, but... have you noticed how Hitler keeps coming back no matter how many times you kill him? How *you* keep coming back no matter how many missions you've already taken? In fact, who's the madman here?

Regarding mapping, your mileage may vary, but they're certainly extensive and tricksy. The author suggest they be played on the lowest difficulty level, and for good reason: sometimes you will find entire rooms chock full of enemies. Usually there are also two paths that you can take, which is of course achieved via secret elevators... and be careful which elevator you take, or you might end up on an infinite loop. Just a fair warning.
