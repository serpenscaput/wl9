Blitzkrieg. There's actually two PC mods by that name, Blitzkrieg by Barry (again!) and The Blitzkrieg, an unreleased mod by Zach Haggis. Well, our Mac Blitzkrieg is just a 6-level mapset for the First Encounter. Said maps are mostly small and quickly beaten. There's more than enough resources to get rid of all the opposition (although that map 3...) It's not brilliant, but it'll do just fine if you have to feed your MacenWolf addiction.
