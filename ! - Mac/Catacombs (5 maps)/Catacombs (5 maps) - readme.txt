And then we have a five-map First Encounter mod called Catacombs (yes), once again by an unknown author. These maps are mostly rectangular, tightly designed, with lots of secret pushwalls that sometimes lead to side areas of significant size. No readme or anything, just some Nazis to kill. Don't miss it.
