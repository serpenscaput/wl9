Roberstein, originally distributed as two separate scenarios (called RobertStein - Finest and Robertstein - Tricky), gives us a total of 21 new maps for the First Encounter. As usual, our lord and savior Clubey only knows the name of the author, nothing more. There's apparently no storyline or theme beyond a showcase of Robert's skills. To be frank, the maps themselves are rather small and simplistic, but the number somewhat compensates for it. "Tricks" generally involve pushwalls and bosses.
