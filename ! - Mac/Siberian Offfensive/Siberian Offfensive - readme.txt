The year is 1944 and Hitler has decided that chemical warfare is his best bet for both defeating Allied armies and exterminating Jews. Intelligence reports indicate that a dangerous gas (Zyklon B?) is being developed in a secret facility in Siberia. You are to infiltrate the compound and retrieve a vial of this chemical agent, of course leaving a trail of blood in your wake. Don't freeze to death, soldier. Dismissed!

Welcome to Siberian Offensive, a 20-level scenario for the Third Encounter made by Ian Brown. One of the few total conversions still left to be ported for this project, Siberian Offensive brings almost all new wall textures and sprites. It has a well developed, cohesive visual style: shades of grey, brown and red dominate this unfriendly environment. Fortunately you'll be fighting largely indoors, so there's no real chance of catching frostbite. In the mapping department, things are as good as you can expect from Ian Brown: interesting, varied map layouts with simple but fun combat scenarios all around the place. Floors aren't overpopulated and bosses are used sensibly; as early as map 3 you can encounter big guards, tough grenade throwers, and even a tank. Exploration is rewarded by treasure, although Ian sometimes teases you with items that can never be reached. Ian also makes excellent use of transparent wall quarters. If I had to look for a weak side, I'd have to point out that a few places could use to be less symmetrical. Otherwise it's all solid stuff.
