Your mission: go deep behind enemy lines and rescue downed Allied pilots from German clutches. To this end, you and your army buddy John are airdropped right in the middle of Berlin and promptly apprehended by the SS (big surprise). You're taken to castle Ubers(c)hwemmung and incarcerated, but by sheer coincidence, you find out that Hitler's personal quarters are found on the top floor of this castle. You escape with the greatest of ease and massacre everyone in the castle, only to find that Hitler isn't there. Now, where did he go? Uh, oh...

Wolfver2601 is responsible for two Mac scenarios for the Third Encounter: Ubershwemmung (sic) Burg and Kastriren Burg. Both have ten maps, though in the former one, the tenth level is inaccessible without using cheats. Both are pure mapsets, there are no new graphics here. So how do the maps hold up to scrutiny? Well, there's quite a few claustrophobic passages mixed with some larger rooms (Kastriren Burg, the chronologically later set, veers somewhat towards openness). Lots of guards, but that's to be expected; at least you get the necessary resources to fight them with: sometimes you're going to find massive caches of health and ammo, especially when bosses are near. Maps are generally rather small, spanning just several rooms, though there are exceptions. Mutants show up, but they're limited to Ubershwemmung Burg (for storyline purposes; you'll see, it's a bit clever). Overall these sets are not the best thing in the world, but they do their job just fine.
