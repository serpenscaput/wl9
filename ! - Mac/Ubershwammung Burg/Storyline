With your war buddy, Jon, you parachute into the middle of Berlin.  There you are ambushed by a team of Schutz Staffel led by a freak with spikes coming out of his shoulders.  You and Jon are split up, you are taken to a castle called Uberschwemmung.  You were drugged before you were brought in but you vaguely remember seeing dead bodies in green barrels and live bodies coming out of them (maybe you were hallucinating).  Since you've been in your cell you have heard that Hitler's personal living quarters are on the top floor of this castle.  You now realize that these nazis aren't very smart since there is only one man gaurding you. You kill the sissy gaurd and make way to find where Jon is, rescue him, and maybe even kill the scum, Hitler.																	Read Before Playing Kastriren Burg	Where is Hitler?

A lot of my rooms require you to not rush in and shoot every thing that moves but to open the door and wait for things to happen, Some times you might want to fire off a single shot into the room and draw out whatever is there.  Almost none of my secrets are marked, finding them will be difficult but if you just keep on dying try typing in "appleiigs" this should help tremendously 	So how did you like my little scenario?
