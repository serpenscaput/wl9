Escape from Hell by an unknown modder: one map for the First Encounter. There's no storyline attached this time - the author only put Wolf cheat codes in the readme. The only map is very small and full of cells, skeletons and treasure. I don't think it looks much like hell, to be honest, but what can you do?
