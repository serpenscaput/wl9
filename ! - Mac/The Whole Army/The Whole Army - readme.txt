The Whole Army (single map, unknown author) is a slightly different concept. Once again you have a horde of enemies in front of you, but you will have to face them piecemeal, one type of enemy per room, including bosses eventually. Survive this gauntlet and you, er, win the war, I suppose, since you killed the whole army...
