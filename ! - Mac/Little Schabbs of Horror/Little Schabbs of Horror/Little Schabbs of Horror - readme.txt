This time I bring you the demo (unfortunately, so far I were unable to locate the full version) of what promised to be a major and pretty interesting mod. Called Little Schabbs of Horror and made by Jon Wigand with assistance from (among others) Laz Rojas, in its current form it has five maps for the Third Encounter, plenty new graphics and some sounds. The story is a slightly odd deal. Germany is losing the war, but doctor Schabbs' Mutants are growing in numbers and pulling off unexpected victories. Having shut down the Oświęcim camp and ransacked Hitler's private quarters (what was he doing there?), you find top secret documents outlining the existence of clandestine targets where the Mutant experiment is being continued and perfected. Fast forward a bit and you're airdropped next a black hole fortress that emits no light. Go inside, destroy a force of Mutants, and throw a wrench in Schabbs' experiments.

According to the attached documentation, John Wigand used to be associated with the famous Wolfaddict Software, Laz Rojas' modding industry powerhouse. Presumably he split off at some point and created Wizbang Software for his own mods. The distribution method (public demo, pay $12 for the full thing) is similar, as is the ordering form. If someone still has the full version lying around, I'd appreciate if you sent it to me.
