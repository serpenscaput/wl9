What's next? Well, in the words of an extremely overrated Polish singer: it's a Weird World. A seven-floor Weird World, although the exact number of maps depends on release, because what we have here is again a mod with three different variants available. There's the Third Encounter one called Weird World with seven maps, and there's two First Encounter ones: version 1.0 with only 4 levels and version 1.5 with 7 again, although in the end, they all seem to keep to First Encounter limitations, and any differences between the most recent variant and version 1.5 are exceedingly small. Mapping itself is surprisingly varied, differint greatly in size and style, and while some of it is standard fare, you'll also have to go through set pieces like a long passage full of dogs, a crossfire by dozens of bosses, or a pushwall-oriented floor. All in all, worth a go.

The mapsets were made by Sean Howard who did not provide them with any documentation, but in this case, I have decided to break away from the norm a little and include a Wolf3D mapping guide written by the author himself and posted on comp.sys.mac.games late in 1994. He explains some bugs that may occur in gameplay, gives hints regarding pushwalls and a few miscellaneous hints, while the remaining sections remain incomplete, but it's still a neat example of an early Mac Wolf mapping guide. Enjoy.
