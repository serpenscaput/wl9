Boss Levels : 1-6by Doug Bancroft (1 level for the 2nd Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 1st-2nd Encounter, and was made by Doug Bancroft, a Wolfenstein add-on creator of the past. It is very difficult to find scenarios by these first generation authors these days because all the veterans have long but left the scene. Doug Bancroft's scenarios are also very hard to find.I hardly know anything about this author besides that he created "Boss Levels". If you know any other scenario by Doug Bancroft, please drop me a line at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpOther StuffThough the author gives all 6 of his "Boss Levels" levels out individually, some of them seem to be impossible to beat without cheating or possible only by running past the Bosses! Levels 2 & 5 are such levels.CopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
