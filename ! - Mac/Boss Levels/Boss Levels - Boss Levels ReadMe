Wolfenstein 3-D levels by Doug BancroftI got tired of seeing Hans (that's what I call that big blue bugger), so I did a bunch ofreally fast hacks and put in all of the bosses. By the end of the week (December 9) I should have a hack to put in some of the cool weapons. These were created using WolfEdit. If there are any problems with my levels, let me know at S15173MB@UMASSD.EDUEnjoy!P.S. Due to the fact that the levels are small and have NO weapons in them, I would strongly recommend getting WolfenCheat.P.P.S. I also recommend WolfenZoom.AMEN.
