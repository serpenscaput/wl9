Hey-ho, let's go!

I guess I should have ported today's scenario alongside with Gargoyle, but I wasn't aware of the similarities before. No matter. Hitler's Demise Comiplatio copy is a First Encounter scenario by Cyan 23, containing 16 maps. Out of this sixteen, several were already featured in Gargoyle (or the other way around - I don't know the chronology). To learn a little bit about these maps, refer to the readme of Gargolye. Meanwhile, the new maps... Well, they're mazes. And I don't mean the mild variety like what can be found a in a few maps in Wolfenstein 3D or the Spear mission packs. I mean murder mazes that will destroy your pathetic soul. You have been warned.
