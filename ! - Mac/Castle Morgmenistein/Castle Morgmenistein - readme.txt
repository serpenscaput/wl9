Castle Morgmenistein by Joel Brown. 17 maps for the Third Encounter. The year is 1943 and doctor Schabbs has teamed up with professor Quarkblitz to create a robotic army for the Third Reich, threatening their eventual decisive victory over the Allies. Heck, prototypes are already in existence. You are sent to Castle Morgmenistein on a one-man mission (now that's unheard of). Your goal is to destroy the prototypes, steal blueprints, and eliminate the daring duo (and presumably a bunch of other scientists along the way).

Castle Morgmenistein comes with almost all new graphics. Every enemy save Schabbs and a few ghosts is replaced, almost every wall as well. Some graphics were custom made for the scenario, while quite a few others come from outside sources. The result is visually consistent and pleasant to look at. The 17 included maps share are mostly medium-sized and share some elements of their design; especially, you will rarely find areas wider than three tiles as everything is kept in a compact, narrow series of passages, with slightly more open areas in scant numbers (mostly in later maps). Enemies are numerous, but not overwhelmingly so. You will also find "teases" along the way - areas with a lot of resources that cannot be reached in any way, mocking you mercilessly. All in all, this is a good set for fans of the classic Mac experience. Do enjoy.
