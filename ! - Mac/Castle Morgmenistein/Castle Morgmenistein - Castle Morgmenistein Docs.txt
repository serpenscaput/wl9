STORYLINE


It's the year 1943, and Dr Schabbs and his minions are crammed into a castle just outside Berlin ... Morgmenistein Castle.

Schabbs and his right-hand man, Professor Quarkblitz, are working on a project that would definitely hand the Second World War over to Adolf Hitler's Nazis.  

This project is said to involve some kind of 'killer robot.'


Your mission, Captain B.J. Blazkowicz, is to:

1) penetrate the Nazi defences, 
2) make your way through Castle Morgmenistein, 
3) grab hold of the blueprints for the Schabbs project,
4) destroy the robot prototypes,
5) and - finally - eliminate the evil Doctor himself!

The very best of good fortune to you, B.J..  Reports indicate you're going to need to!! 

Distribution & Use

Castle Morgmenistein is FREEWARE ... i.e. you don't have to pay a penny for these levels. 

What I do ask is that if you edit Castle Morgmenistein and choose to upload it, please tell me about it and change its name to something else.

Graphics
I've no problem with you 'borrowing' any graphics I have made (though it should be remembered that I did borrow some material from various well known Wolf scenarios ... thanks to all the original authors!).

Special thanks must go to Clubey for his excellent work on the Professor Quarkblitz frames, to Iceman for various wall and object designs, to Laz for his basic design of both the Schabb's wagon and the orange robot suit ... and ... apologies for leaving anyone out!
 
Circulating
Please send Castle Morgmenistein in its entirety to every corner of the internet. Put this scenario on DVDs, CDs, Zips, or the plain old floppies - whatever. Just keep the original documentation with it
