So. Today's scenario is called ok, it's extremely tiny (yet still manages to have Hitler in it) and it can and probably will crash because there's no walls on the northern and western borders of the map. Still, if I want this project to be complete, scenarios like these will have to be ported too. Might as well do it now.
