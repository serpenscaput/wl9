Machine Gun World is an early First Encounter mapset made by Yan Choon Ee. The name sounds Korean, though I can't tell if it's South Korea or Best Korea. Four maps again, the game appears to start you off in a familiar place, but you'll soon find yourself battling through a variety of new rooms full of secrets and densely populated by First Encounter enemies. I suppose the mapset's name refers to the high number of SS grunts found around the place, as most maps don't even have a machine gun otherwise.
