Kampfhenne de Fuhrer is something of a mystery, being a 2002 scenario that came with no documentation whatsoever. I have been told that the title translates roughly as Fuhrer's Battle Hen, but it's just a mapset (no new graphics included), so there's no chicken to be found in the game, battle or otherwise. Instead you'll find four maps with generally tight architecture and plenty of narrow passages.
