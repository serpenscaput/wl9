Dungeons of Death! An ancient, 1993 shareware mapset by an unknown author, it displays many of the charming features and trappings of early Wolfenstein mapping. Somewhat all over the place, happy-go-lucky stuff with quite a bit of creativity and passion behind it, complex and involved maps, always high difficulty and a layout that's hard to learn. The Mac mod, Dungeon of Death (singular; 10 maps for the First Encounter), somewhat reminds me of that with its large, freeform maps packed with enemies and, well, stuff. I don't think there's a story to either of those releases. You just kill people. Are we even sure they're Nazis? Maybe you're assaulting the local historical reconstructionist group? Wouldn't that be funny, with all the innocent people dying. Hah, hah.

Dungeon of Death was made by Mike Gerenser and looking at the readme, he asked people to give him an $2 shareware fee for his trouble, so he could go on making more mods. Looking at Dermuda's invaluable list of mods and authors, I can't find his name anywhere else, so I guess it didn't take. Too bad.
