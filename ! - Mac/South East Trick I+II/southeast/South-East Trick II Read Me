South East Trick II(4 levels for the 3rd Encounter)NOTE : The South East Trick is usable only in the 3rd Encounter!!Some StuffThis scenario was made recently to inform newcoming level designers of the South East Corner Trick and its possibilities. Not so many people, not even seasoned level creators, seem to utilise this trick in their scenarios. That's why I made this, just for referential purposes. So don't give me mail telling me its too short or that you can't find some stuff needed to proceed. It's supposed to be short and the missing things are hidden in the corners!CopyrightsIf you do something with this scenario, just give me credit, and everything else is yours!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
