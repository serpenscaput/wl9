This is a duo of small mapsets called South/East Trick I and II. Putting them together was the logical thing to do. All in all, there's seven Third Encounter maps here. The scenarios were created by Clubey for one specific purpose: to teach aspiring mappers about the eponymous South-East Trick. That is to say, in Third Encounter you can grab items from otherwise inaccessible tiles as long as the tile you're currently on is adjacent to the south-eastern corner of the target tile. It's actually a very simple thing. These maps have numerous objects hidden that way and you can't complete them without exploiting the trick. Although, like RobertStein, these maps are rather compact and simple, there's still some meat here.

Word of warning: South/East Trick II has the same three maps as South/East Trick I, but the difficulty is ramped way up and the fourth map is brand new.
