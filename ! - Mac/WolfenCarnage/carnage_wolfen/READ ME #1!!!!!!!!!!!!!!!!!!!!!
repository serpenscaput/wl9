Here are ten Wolfenstien 3D levels.  To run them you have to have Wolfenstien 3d and WolfEdit.  These levels are harder than others, so the codes are advised as well.

			    Story:
		       You decided to attack Germany once agian, even though the war is over.
		       Even though Hitler is dead, Germany is still powering up, and preparing to attack.
       They got too strong, and while you were heading into the enemy camp, you where caught.
       The Germans put you deep in the dungeon, and posted tons of guards.

The codes are highly recommended for these levels, although help is available.
