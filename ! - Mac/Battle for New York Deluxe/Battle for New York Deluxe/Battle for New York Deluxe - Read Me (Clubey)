Battle for New York DeluxeAuthor Unknown(6 levels for the 3rd Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 3rd Encounter, but unfortunately, I could not find out who was responsible for its creation.If you know anything about this author or of any other scenario of his, please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpWARNING!The author of this scenario left an inaccessible secret room in the north-west corner of the map in level 1-6, so I revised it a bit to make it accessible. The change has not altered any vital aspect of the game architecture. CopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author is unknown, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you do not claim it to be your creation, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
