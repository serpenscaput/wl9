And as for our port, it's... Spear of Destiny. I know, some of you probably already thought me mad for porting a port of Operation Overkill, so what on Earth am I doing porting a port of an official game? Well, I don't care what you think uh I mean think about it this way, you'll find out how Laz chose to deal with Mac features and restrictions limiting his options, what enemies are placed like, how he solved the issue of the floor 18 to Hell transition after collecting the Spear... And of course experience the game in 128x128 glory. Well, most of the time.

Nothing else to say. It's Spear, duh. 21 familiar maps for the Third Encounter, enjoy.

Laz Rojas for porting, some buncha weirdos for the original game
