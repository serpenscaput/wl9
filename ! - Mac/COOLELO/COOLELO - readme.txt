And then there's COOLELO (authorship unknown), the only scenario (only today, that is) to make use of Third Encounter. It's a single map that pits you against a horde of enemies and no ammo, weapons or health (except for some 1ups later on) to handle then with... and when you do get some nice armaments, they're no longer really useful unless you want to go for a bonus fight of sorts. Generally speaking, the map is made of linear one- or two-tile wide passages, not the most thrilling stuff I've seen to be honest.
