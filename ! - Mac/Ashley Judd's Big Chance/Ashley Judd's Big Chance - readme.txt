Ashley Judd Day (5 maps) and Ashley Judd's Big Chance (16 maps) are two scenarios for the Second Encounter made by Richard Peck (RDP). If you enjoy Peck's maps, you will like these two as well. There's a lot of variety involved in map design here; architecture ranges from fairly tight and compact (like the final map of Ashley Judd Day) to large and open (see some late levels of Big Chance). Ashley Judd Day in particular beings with very large levels and slowly transitions into much smaller designs like the aforementioned final, fifth map). Combat is often pretty intense, but the maps aren't ridiculously crowded. Architecture and static objects are often employed in ways to make the player's task harder. All in all, interesting reading material, and if you want to read something more about it, refer to the ReadMe file (do not confusion with readme.txt) included with Big Chance to see Dermuda showering the sets with praise. Is it deserved? You be the judge.
