1st Encounter Hell by an unknown author is a 6-level mapset for the First Encounter (duh). This is the largest of today's scenarios, both in the number of maps and their overall size (especially map 4 is a giant, spanning nearly the entire grid). As for the mapping style, initially we only have some square rooms (well decorated and populated), but over time the author develops more flair.
