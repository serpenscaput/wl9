Halten Sie is a mapset made by Laz Rojas, it's not nearly as ambitious as some of his other projects, but features his trademark mapping if that's what you're after. The storyline is admittedly rather generic: while spying on Jerries, you find out they're preparing for an unexpected counteroffensive (since the readme talks about the liberation of Paris, I assume this means the Ardennes offensive). But before you can go back and inform your higher-ups, the entire squad is captured and imprisoned. Two months later, everyone else has been killed in interrogation and now it's your turn. Last chance to escape and throw a wrench in their gears. 11 maps for the Second Encounter, a custom episode thumbnail and not much else.
