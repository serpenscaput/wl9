This is part of a four-mod release of Bin Laden-themed mods. This fourth mod is an entirely different beast, completely unrelated to the Bin Ladenstein family. Five maps. Without any documentation, all I can tell you that it's set mostly in a desert environment (although with some houses and other entrenched interious here and there). You're going to fight a *lot* of enemies clad in all white, all decorated with a dazzling new gameplay palette for a rather unique aesthetic experience. It's a must see.
