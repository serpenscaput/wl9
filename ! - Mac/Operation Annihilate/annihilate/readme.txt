Operation: Annihilate, 10 maps for the Third Encounter, is a similar deal to BJ's Revenge. You attack a Nazi fortress, aiming to kill everyone inside, but find the place to be very well prepared defensively (well, duh, it's a fortress). Thus you'll frequently end up in combat scenarios where enemies outflank you, hide behind objects or otherwise have some sort of advantage over you. There's a little fewer enemies but also much less amo than in BJ's Revenge, all in all the release feels a bit more fine-tuned.
