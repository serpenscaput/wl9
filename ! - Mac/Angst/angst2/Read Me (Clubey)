Angst!Kirk Clyne (2 levels for the 2nd Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 2nd Encounter, and was made by Kirk Clyne.I know nothing about this author besides the fact that he made two "Angst!" scenarios, and sometimes referred to them as "KOIKENSTEIN".  I also know he made a 6 level scenario called  "Castle Gasundheit", but I haven't managed to find it yet. There was a READ ME file with this 2nd Encounter remake of "Angst!" which talked about how this scenario came to being.If you know anything about this author or of any other scenario of his, please contact me at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpWARNING!!In the level 2-2 of this scenarioo there is an opening where the level design is not concealed from the rim of the level format. Poking around such openings will most likely freeze your computer. Don't go near the place!CopyrightsJudging from what the author writes in his READ ME, this scenario probably was Mailware. But, I doubt you could catch the author today by his old email address, which is KOIK@AOL. If you intend to use anything from this scenario, just give the author due credit.Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
