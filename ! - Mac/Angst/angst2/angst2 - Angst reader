Hey there!So a few weeks ago I had a really bad night at work. And when I got home, I popped together a Wolfensein version of the restaurant where I work. HA ha! What satisfaction! Who cares if I'm dysfunctional--it felt great. And it turned out to be one heckuvva level to get through. Inspired, I created a level the next day based on the park the restaurant sits on. Since I couldn't actually line all the sidewalks with trees--too many objects--I put up walls instead. And this level, too, turned out to be loads o' fun and NOT very easy to get through, either. So...Level 1- THE COMPOUND (the park). It's a popular place. Lotsa Nazis to kill. And there's one secret worth checking out.  My advice: Never Relax.Level 2- HEADQUARTERS. The only advice I have would be to discourage you from just barging on in without reservations. But you'll figure that out. And it may help to do things in a certain order, but you'll figure that out, too. No big secrets here, just 2 little ones. Kinda funny to play this level thinking it's a restaurant. When you walk in the door, just tell them you're with the "Nazi" party. Haha!AND--if you like these levels, check out my other upload "Castle Gasundheit"--it's 6 levels made in the more classic Wolf way. Debugged and edited for weeks. I'm almost happy with it now, happy enough to upload it--in a couple days. Look for it...AND--please send E-mail to KOIK@AOL and tell me what you think. For the effort that went in to them, I only ask for a little feedback from someone like you. Have fun! Kirk ClyneKOIKPS: I never cheat and can vouch that these levels are challenging but never impossible, making cheating unnecessary and un-fun. But, you know, if you can't Handle it...
