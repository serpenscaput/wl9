Supplementing Meginstein is a single-floor Second Encounter scenario scenario by Giuseppe Levi called Gamma. It comes with no documentation. The map was originally made in WolfMaker (all the hallmarks are plainly visible), but heavily edited afterwards, so it retains some merit. You will fight many officers and brown guards, and push numerous secrets, before the floor can be completed.
