WolfenFart 1 for the Second Encounter by Taya consists of three scenarios. First comes Hot Stuff. Six rather small maps with an overabundance of ammo, but if you don't pick up the rocket launcher on the second floor, you're quite screwed. The Cloning factory only has one map, which is a massive slugfest between you and hordes of bosses. The saga of stuff also has only one map and it's a pretty big one, but full of single tile-wide passages and enemies waiting in ambush.WolfenFart 2 for the Second Encounter consists of four scenarios. Assault on Fortress xan is the biggest of the four, clocking in at a hefty 8 maps. As was the case with Hot Stuff, they're mostly smaller than average, but this time you get less ammo (or none at all, like in map 6). Combat still mostly comprises enemies trying to ambush you in narrow passages. All other scenarios here only have one map: Childs Play is a pretty large one, with several bosses and a bunch of ambushing enemies waiting to get you. The same description more or less applies to Danger Gardens. Lastly, Santa's Surpise does not actually feature Santa (no custom graphics), but you will end up figthing Adolf in the end. Maybe he's got a gift for you.===CREDITS===Taya.
