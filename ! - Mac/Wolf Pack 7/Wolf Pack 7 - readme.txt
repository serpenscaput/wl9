Wolf Pack 7 by Andres Vialpando has four scenarios. They are:
* A death level has one map. It's a highly symmetrical design, but also fairly clever. Not the easiest thing in the world either.
* The Game brings three maps and a Saw reverie. The three maps are very small and easily beaten.
* The little blood stained house has one map. It's largely a big brown weave maze with a bunch of optional content.
* The Mailmans payday has two maps. The first one is relatively interesting, the second one is just an afterthought as the eponymous mailman exacts his revenge for all the dogs that bit his legs in the past.

Wolf Pack 8 has three scenarios. They are:
* Nazi HQ is by far the largest offering in today's package, with a total of nine maps. The levels are frankly all over the place regarding size and diffculty progression. Some nice floors in here, but you end the set on a rather sour note.
* Xell has two maps, one smaller than the other. Very little content in here, but hey, it's free.
* Lastly, Yonkers has one map. Follow a trail of chainguns and dispose of multiple bosses on your way to Hitler and his big bodyguard.

Wow, just one more update and we'll be done with Wolfenstein Blowout. Time sure flies fast over here.
