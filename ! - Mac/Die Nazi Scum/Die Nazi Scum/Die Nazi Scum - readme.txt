And here we have Die Nazi Scum. Hmmm, that's a different type of die. Anyway, these three First Encounter maps by Jacob Welch (probably) all feature different design themes, so there's some variety involved as every map has its own quirk, but don't expect miracles. It's an OK Mac offering, nothing more, nothing less.

Jacob Welch. Maybe. Not even Clubey is sure about authorship here.
