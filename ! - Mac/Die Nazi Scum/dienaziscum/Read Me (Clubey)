Die Nazi Scum!by Jacob Welch ? (3 levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThese levels are designed for use with the 2nd Encounter, and was presumably made by Jacob Welch. I presumed so because the level was submitted to an old Wolfestein page long ago by a Jacob Welch. I hardly know anything about this author besides that he might have also created "Dog Pound". If you know any other scenario by Jacob Welch, please drop me a line at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpCopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
