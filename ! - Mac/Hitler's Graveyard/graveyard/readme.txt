Like the first Astrostein or Munchkinstein, Hitler's Graveyard is packing 30 new maps for the Third Encounter. The storyline is actually somewhat bare-bones; the war is over and now the game is on for all the treasures the Third Reich stole during their conquests. You, one of the bounty hunters after Hitler's riches, have located a graveyard somewhere in some Polish sinkhole. Below is a vast system of catacombs, no doubt full of valuable prizes. But as you descend and examine your surroundings, you come to realize the unthinkable - the place is haunted!

And how. The mod mixes some custom, ghastly graphics and sounds with a bunch of resouces from Spear of Destiny, Doom and Heretic to create a brooding and gritty atmosphere. The place is grey. Grey like sorrow. Grey like death. With some red for all the blood you spill.
