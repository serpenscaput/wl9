Hitler's Graveyard 

For years, the Nazis have been amassing a large collection of treasure and religious artifacts stolen from conquered countries all across Europe. Now that the war is over, the hunt is on to track down this ill-gotten booty. Some of it has been hidden away in the strangest and most inaccessible of places. One of these places is the cemetary known only as Hitler's Graveyard, a huge network of underground catacombs somewhere in Poland. It is here that you begin your search, shrugging aside ridiculous rumors that the place is haunted. But as you begin your descent into the dark, narrow tunnels, you realize some of these rumors just might be true... and even worse, that the Nazis assigned to guard the treasure have no idea the Allies have won and don't intend to give up without a fight.
