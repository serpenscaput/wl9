On to Operation Overkill. So this one is actually a port (by Laz Rojas) of a PC mapset of the same name, released by Randall Penn in mid-1994. Yeah, I'm porting a port. That's because 1) I want to be thorough and 2) it's still a bit of a different experience on Mac. Speaking of, let's briefly discuss Laz' porting conduct based on this example. First of all, there's a few new walls added to better represent the original output, as well as Gretel Grosse (sadly not upscaled to Mac native sprite resolution). The maps themselves are meticulous re-creations of the originals, and while some concessions have to be made to fit the thing within Mac limitations (some guards were removed because of the 127 max limit, some objects replaced because they have no direct counterpart on Mac), in general this is a port of commendable accuracy...

That's what I thought, until I realized that the secret map is inaccessible! I donnow, perhaps I'm doing something wrong, or I have an old version of the set (but it was downloaded directly from Laz' website...), but fact is, the alternate exit is set up properly, but the alternate elevator object itself is not where it should be (or anywhere else). Faced with a bug this critical, I have decided to do what I do extremely rarely and intervene, fixing the issue. The secret exit is thus somewhere in floor 1 and you'd do good to seek it, as well as play all the other floors, because it's not a symptom of PC master race arrogance when I say this mod features some of the best mapping you can find on the Mac scene.
