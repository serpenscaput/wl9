Thank you for downloading the Dragon Cavern Lite! This is the sequel to The Castle of Lost Souls!Requires:Wolfenstein 3D 2nd, 3rd, or Commercial EncountersThe All New Mondo Wolfenstein Sounds (Optional)CourageThis is a Beta version of the Dragon Cavern, but it's cool! The full version will have custom graphics (I hope), sounds (I've already got them), and 40 more levels of misery! The Dragon Cavern Lite is small, but AWESOME!Just put this into the Levels folder and GO!E-mail me at horace@mail1.erinet.com for details, because I am a very busy man and I couldn't spend much time making this.Ciao!
