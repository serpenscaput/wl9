BREAKTHROUGH ENHANCED-----THE STORYWhen you were first imprisoned by this bunch of Nazis and thrown into their prison you thought that escape was the only objective.Guess what?  You were wrong.You finally passed the 32nd level of their fortress and found only a note.TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:Oh, no, you think.  Not again, not them...WE ARE A SMALL ORGANIZATION.. OH, FORGET IT!  YOU PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT US ALREADY.  NOW FIGHT US OR DIE!!THE PARTY OF FIVEADOLF HITLER, CEO.We are not affiliated with 20th Century Fox Television or any of their shows.As you continue your exhausting journey, your only thought is: "Here we go again."-----Thanks for registering Breakthrough!  I really appreciate your support.  It makes me happy that I was able to make something that someone, somewhere thought good enough to pay for.In the future, I plan to sit down and make a few levels for Marathon... but if YOU'VE ever tried it, you KNOW how time-consuming THAT is.  I also want to write a SPAM, but I don't yet have an idea for a plot.But for now, here's Breakthrough Enhanced!You may have asked, "Just HOW is Breakthrough enhanced?"  HERE'S how!- Second Encounter graphics.  The same walls can get repetitive, so now you can look at some other ones.  Not EVERY First Encounter wall has been replaced, but SOME have.- Second Encounter music.  If you turned the music off in Breakthrough because of the repeating four songs, you can turn it back on now!- Second Encounter weapons.  Finally, you can use the flamethrower and bazooka against those nasty Nazis.- Second Encounter enemies.  They're not gonna let you have the only advantage!  Just when you thought you had it with your two new weapons, the Elite Guards and the Zombies had to step in.  Watch out!- Eight new levels, including some of my best ever.  And a new objective- to destroy the Party Of Five... again!Breakthrough Enhanced has 40 levels.  Think you were good in Breakthrough?  THINK AGAIN!  These new enhancements will prove either that you AREN'T, or that it WASN'T LUCK!Now, stop reading and START SHOOTING!  Oh, yeah, and Have Fun!AJT
