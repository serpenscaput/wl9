The Third Reich
======================================================================
In the year 1949, the nefarious Dr. Schabbs 2 has been amassing an army of mutants.  It is rumored that Adolf Hitler himself is overseeing the production of the undead army.   The mutants are enough to overthrow the Allied Army unless you can stop them single handedly.  There's only one problem, you were caught by the Nazi's and thrown in a bunker's prison miles under Berlin.  While kicking your annoying cellmate's ass, you  throw him into the cell door.  The impact causes the door to break from its rusty hinges and smashes into the guard.  You pick up the knife and gun and face the door that leads to your escape, or a violent and needlesly bloody death.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Third Reich is freeware
It requires 3rd encounter or commercial version.
I tried to make this scenario as serious as possible, but of course, 
things to a tern for
the worse.
