Wolf Pack 3 is a compilation of four First Encounter scenarios by Andres Vialpando.
* Escape from Bunker Ruth has one map. Yes, you're breaking out of a dungeon, but the map isn't very E1M1-like otherwise. A decent effort.
* Growl Keep has two maps. They're small and short levels that end with a simple boss fight.
* Nazi Temple has three maps. Some of them are pretty large in terms of editor space, but rather basic otherwise. There are two boss fights this time! Be careful on map 3.
* SS HQ is one of the two scenarios ported today that include new graphics (in this case, a custom thumbnail). You also get three rather nice maps. Challenging and red.

Wolf Pack 4 is a compilation of four First Encounter scenarios by Andres Vialpando, too.
* Castlelope has one map. It's medium in size and full of challenging fights, to the point where I'm not sure if it can be completed without cheats. Very difficult at any rate.
* DeathMatch has one map. A very simplistic showdown with multiple bosses.
* NEEE! has one map. There are no knights here, just a lot of brown guards and dogs in a rather extensive map.
* Lastly, There's the sign up ahead! has one map. It's a tiny floor with just two fights in total.
