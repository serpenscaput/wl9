Brobst's CC and Brobst's Marathon are both 2-floor First Encounter mapsets by John Brobst. I only know his first name thanks to Clubey's readme attached to Marathon, but otherwise nothing is known about these sets. Marathon is probably the more interesting of the two, featuring Mac-style tight mapping with a number of bosses and some small tricks to keep you on your toes. Brobst's CC manages to be even more cramped and throws in a huge maze for good measure, all populated extremely densely by SS.
