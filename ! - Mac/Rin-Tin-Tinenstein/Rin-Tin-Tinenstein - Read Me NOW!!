THIS IS RIN-TIN-TINENSTEIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!							(and no, I do not think it's stupid)The required stuff:Game Type         :Wolf 3DVersoins Supported:Commercial Version, 3rd encounter, and maybe 2nd encounter?Episode, level#   :What?Single Player     :Duh!Difficulty Setting:I don't think soNew sounds        :NopeNew graphics      :NottaNew music         :ya, right*Construction*Base              :New level from scratch Editer used       :WolfEdit v1.1cBuild time        :around 1 weekBugs              :None that I know ofThe StoryRin-Tin-Tin got sick of being a "K-9 cop."So one day he turned on his trainer and ran all the way to Germany (you know how these T.V. dogs are.) A few years later, he showed up with a superfortress and an entire army! Right now he has stolen the world's supply of DOG FOOD! Your mission is to infiltrate his fortress and stop him! Don't do it for me, do it for dogs everywhere!These are my first levels (ALLLLL 12 of them) for Wolf3D, so don't blame me if they stink (that would hurt my feelings now wouldn't it!)
