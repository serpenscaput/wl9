Battle Arena 2001by scooter_31210(1 level for the 3rd Encounter)Some StuffThis level is designed for use with the 2nd Encounter, and was made by scooter_31210.He is also the author of the scenario "Battle Arena 2000", "Deathmatch", "Deathmatch Revisited", "Dungeon", "East Tower", "Gang Fight" and "Teletubbystein". As of I know, he is one of the few active scenario creators of Mac Wolf. His scenarios are quite solid and good. He usually distributes his scenarios through the "infomac hyperarchives", but recently I happened to ask for and receive two of his scenarios directly through email (Thank you scooter! It was so kind!). I so dearly hope everyone who plays this scenario or any other of his to send feedback to the author (scooter_31210@yahoo.com). Please remember, your mail could be the one to persuade and encourage the author to go on releasing new scenarios in the future!!CopyrightsSince this scenario was sent to me directly from scooter_31210, distributing this scenario without the prior permission of the author is not allowed. Using the level as a basis to a new creation should be first consulted to the author, too. In any case, you should contact the author for any specific instructions. Do anything at your own risk!!AcknowledgementsMy deepest thank you to the author sccoter_31210 for kindly permitting me to distribute this scenario at my website!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
