System crashes have resulted from Wolfenstein not being able to take the heat in levels such as Battle Arena. There are a few things that I have done to keep Wolfenstein running while playing in such a large area:ÑDo not run as much.ÑTry to stay away from running right next to the perimeter wall unless there's no other way out or you need to resupply.ÑSave your game.ÑQuit all other open applications and save any work!
