You didn't think we were done with Doom, did you? We supplement the release of Doomenstein with seven more Doom-related scenarios. Here goes (in no particular ordeR)...

DOOM-MIX by Emptynet is a single-map scenario for the First Encounter. As the name implies, it's a highly symmetrical level with relatively light opposition and an optional boss fight.

Doom (symetrical) is a single-map scenario for the First Encounter by an unknown author. It's basically the same map, but with ceiling lights added as plentiful decoration. I doubt Emptynet would release two versions of his scenario with such minor differences, so I'm guessing someone took his mod and "improved" it. Oh well.

Doom Lair is a three-msp scenario for the Third Encounter by Hacki Sak. You will find rather diverse mapping styles here, along with some very difficult fights. The second map also excels in wasting the player's time.

Doom II level 32 is a single-map scenario for the First Encounter by Jared Pace. It's basically a variant on the vanilla E1M9, except there's five Grosse brothers now and you don't have to fight any of them. Splendid.

Hall of Doom is a five-map First Encounter scenario by CB + JK. The maps range widely in size, from extremely small to pretty extensive. Some of them appear to exhibit WolfMaker traits, but maybe that's just my untrained eye. Lots of combat here (duh), plus many boss encounters that, again, are optional.

Doom Scape 2.0 has a whole friggin 11 maps. It's a Third Encounter scenario by Kevin Brown. The maps are mostly rather long and elaborate, chock full of enemies in tight quarters, although there's a few wide open areas later on in the game (mostly for fighting bosses). Kevin isn't afraid of throwing mutants at the player early on, and bosses follow suit soon. The scenario also throws some curveballs at the player, like the beginning of map (I won't spoil any more, you gotta experience it yourself). Plenty of interesting fights in here, recommended.

DOOMenstein Edit is a First Encounter "scenario" by Jesse Dowdle. It is, in fact, just a graphics test: a map with all walls, sprites and enemies arranged in neat rows. I still ported it because I have to.
