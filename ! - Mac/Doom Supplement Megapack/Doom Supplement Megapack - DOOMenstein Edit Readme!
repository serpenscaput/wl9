                                  DOOMenstein Edit Info 				Doomenstein edit is a version of wolf edit 1.1, but it has been converted to a format for DOOMenstein.				DOOMenstein is a new product from Wolf Addict Software that changes the sprites, sounds, and walls to the DOOM2 format.  You can make your own DOOMenstein levels with this editor, but if you want to play a demo of the real levels (modeled after DOOM2 levels), you need to download the DOOMenstein demo. 				CAUTION!  I have had problems using a copy of WOLF for the real DOOMenstein levels, and ones I have created, so make sure you use a seperate WOLF program for your custom levels, and one for the Professional levels from WOLF addict Software. Finally, since I don't have Wolf 3rd encounter, I have no clue what'll happen when you use it with the 3rd encounter.  I am not responsible for computer crashes, damaged files, or if your pet runs away.				TO save you from insanity, I have put in a converted DOOMenstein version of WOLF.  Believe me, it's worth the download.  You can use this editor with the original 1rst Encounter, but it will not be in the DOOM format.				I have included a map called DOOMenstein setup.  All it is is a map that has at least 1 of everything.  (It's not supposed to be hard or anything.)  You can go through it in DOOMenstein edit, and look at it in the actual game, just to see what the icons in DOOMenstein represent.  I think the Icons are pretty acurate.  There is one that really sucks, though.  It is a little face with crosses for eyes and it says "CORPSE" in the menu.  In the game it is a former human corpse, but I couldn's think of a way to represent it with an icon (sorry!).					NOTE- This is an editor for the demo of DOOMenstein, so if you have the full version of DOOMenstein, You will still only be able to edit the basic demo.  Don't worry!  As soon as I get the full version of DOOMenstein, I plan to make Convert WolfEdit 1.1B into another DOOMenstein editor.					If you find any bugs, or wanna give me any feedback, my Email address is GTR TRIX@AOL.com						Happy Mass Murder!!!!                     																									Jesse Dowdle 4/22/96
