			Remember you people I spent a lot 'o' time on this level so if your stuck don't blame me because here are all the tips I'm gonna give ya! (More if your nice) : )	-always check for secret areas, I may have not put a lot of them but they are there. And to beat one level you have to find it.	-be patient with these levels it took me 3 and a 1/2 hours to make! so it shouldn't really take longer then that to beat the levels but a pretty long time.	-explore every level throughly, if you don't, you could miss something.	-I almost forgot to mention this, since I use codes when I play I didn't put a lot of ammo and life, I do have an answer to the ammo and life problems but I'm only saying the ammo code, it's ,  "burger" 		Remember this level needs Wolfenstein 2nd Encounter so if you don't have it you should register the game if you really would like to play these levels. (It's your choice)             That's all the tips I'm givin' ya!    Good Luck!             Remember if you want to compliment, or complain about these levels feel free                                                         to e-mail me at Hackisak@aol.com.              Or if you already have AOL it's Hacki Sak.             And if you have e World my name is Jerky Boy111.            ***Coming soon to an online service near you, Doom Lair version 2.***
