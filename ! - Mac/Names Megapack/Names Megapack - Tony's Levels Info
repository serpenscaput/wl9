Tony's LevelsThree new Wolfenstein levels by TX Sirron. Now these levels may not have any rooms with 20 bosses or any treasure rooms filled with 20 crowns but hey, thats not what Wolf is all about. I got three levels here that'll challenge all but the best, they got alota bad guys, they got alota secret entrances and they're well put together. They're everything a classic Wolenstein level should be. Send me your comments... send somebody else your complaints. Either way, Have a Blast !!A few hintsThese levels are the most fun when you play 'em without looking at 'em first, except maybe to see where the secret entrances are. They're also best when you play 'em on the hardest level, especially for advanced Wolfers. If you're good you'll be able to beat these levels without any cheats, like I said you won't meet up with 20 bosses in one room in any of my levels so there's no need to have a million bullets. Not to say you shouldn't watch out, you should, you never know where a bad guy'll pop up. One last tip, make sure to get the Gatling Gun on the second level, it helps out alot when you wanna clear out a room full've punks fast.You know your a champ if...If you can beat all three levels without getting shot once you are a champ. If you can beat par on level two with full 100%'s you're pretty damn good and if you can beat par on level three with full 100%'s you are a miracle. One last thing, my record time for par with full 100%'s on level one is 3:07. If you can get under 3 minutes on level one you're a champ (with full 100%'s of course).
