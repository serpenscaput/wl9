The big one is called Operation Ravage (for Third Encounter) and it was made by Alan B. Clem. Over the years, Alan was responsible for at least four mods which tend to introduce very significant modifications to the main game, probably worthy of being called a TC. Tons of new graphics, 10-30 new maps; no new sounds, but those were relatively rare in Mac mods anyway. So why isn't Alan Clem a famous name nowadays, mentioned on one breath with Laz or... Laz? Perhaps because his mods are slightly narrower in scope, or maybe mostly because they're not quite as thematically consistent and deliberate. The selection of new assets on offer here borders between eclectic and haphazard. I'm seeing graphics borrowed from a mish-mash of sources: some Laz Rojas mods, an Afrika Korps Assault guard, PC Wolfenstein sprites, there's an enemy based on Heretic, but also mechanized infantry and outright robots. It's a very diverse bunch to be sure, but makes it hard to guess what's going on, especially considering my copy of the scenario came with no documentation whatsoever. All of that is spread over a massive 28 new maps; these might not be brilliant (a lot of small rooms everywhere), but they at least feel stylistically consistent and there's a few twists and surprises to keep things fresh, like a heavily edited E1M1 reimagining or maps where you begin when you finished the last level and trace your steps back through an already beaten layout until you reach new areas. But I'm not about to spoil everything. Give the mod a go, it might not be a carefully arranged work of art, but it's quite interesting in its own right.
