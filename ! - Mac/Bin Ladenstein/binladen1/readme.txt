This mod is part of a four-mod release of Bin Laden-themed games. Bin Ladenstein (or Bin Wolfenstein; the nomenclature is confusing) is a mod with one map and some pretty creative new graphics as well as some new sound replacements (in fact it comes with an executable with sounds already installed). The readme calls it Bin Ladenstein 3D, the episode selection screen calls it Bin Wolfenstein-3D, and the scenario file itself is named Bin's Hole (In The Ground).
