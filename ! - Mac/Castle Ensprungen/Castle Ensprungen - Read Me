Wolf3D - Castle Ensprungen for First EncounterHere are some really interesting and pretty tough levels for Wolf3D (first encounter).  You need WolfEdit to install them.  There are 8 levels in increasing difficulty.  The first two are relatively easy.  The next two are a little harder.  The next two are even harder.  And the last two are brutal.  They're not just hard because of sheer number of guys, there are a lot of traps and several times you have to beat the big blue dude with just a machine gun.  If you like these levels (or you dislike these levels), e-mail me and tell me what's on your mind.  Oh yeah, and remember to watch your back...Antoni ChanAOL: AntoniC302Internet: antonic302@aol.com
