What you'll need to do is install a new feature into Wolfenstein called the FKEY.  What does the FKEY do?  It adds a feature similiar to Wolfenstein 3D and Wolfenstein 3D-3rd Encounter with which you can LOAD scenarios into Wolfenstein.  In other words, YOU DON'T HAVE TO INSTALL THE SCENARIO.  Be sure to follow the installation and use instructions for the FKEY found in the "WolfFKEY" folder.* The Amnesia Story*"Mr. Blaskowicz!", exclaimed the anxious voice on the videophone.  "You are needed in the CEO's office immediately!"  You jump from your chair, enter the transport module and instantly rematerialize in CEO Yatt's office.  He motions for you to be seated.The look on his face tells you this isn't your average minor conflict he needs you to resolve.  "The planet Frotos is in grave danger," he explains.  "Our routine recon flights to the outer perimeter have uncovered a Nazi base on the moon Pandexium."  "NAZIS!", your eyes get as big as a Frotonian freighter.  "I THOUGHT WE HAD DESTROYED ALL OF THEM!"  "Calm down, B.J.," he says reassuredly.  "Let me explain."Yatt then reveals a disturbing bit of Earth history to you.  Forty days after the apparent surrender of Germany, submarines loaded with nuclear weapons exploded off the coasts of America, Canada, Russia, and England.  The apparent alive and well Hitler and his secret army then declared the Earth as theirs.  However, the nuclear explosions plunged the Earth into a deep nuclear winter except for parts of Europe, South America, and Africa.  After over one hundred Earth years, the Nazis have almost run out of usable atmosphere and resources.  Their apparent solution is to conquer the peaceful planet of Frotos, 25 light years from Earth."That is why we brought you here, Captain.  We foresaw the day when the aggressive Nazis would spread their disease throughout the galaxy.  So, 15 Frotonian years after your disappearance over the Atlantic Ocean, our predictions have unfortunately come true," he stopped, awaiting your reaction.  Visions of fighting the nasty Nazis flashed before you, but without hesitation, you offered, "What can I do?""We need you to go to the Nazi base on a FACT FINDING ONLY mission.  We need you to get as much information about their intentions and weapons and then report back here.  Only then will the council of elders and myself decide our course of action.  Are you up to it?", he asked.  "Of course I will go!," you answer (the adventure side of your being kicking in).So, you are taken to a transport area, given a replicated Nazi uniform, a simple communication module, and a hand held phaser weapon for emergencies.  Yatt explains, "The code name of your mission is AMNESIA, because from this point on, your existence has been erased from our data banks."  You rematerialize in the first dome of the five dome Nazi complex....* What About The New Features?*To access the new features such as the Status Bar, you may have to change screen sizes to load the new Status Bar.  For instance, you play Wolfenstein at the 512 x 384 screen.  You may have to switch to another size and then back to the 512 X 384 size to get the new Status Bar to load.  The new Title Pict will show up if you load the scenario during the first screen if you are using Wolfenstein 3D 2nd Encounter.  For Wolfenstein 3D-3rd Encounter and Wolfenstein 3D users, you'll have to wait until you have finished playing Amnesia to see the new title picture.* Copyright / Permissions *These levels can not be used for a base to construct other levels, neither can any of the custom artwork be used in other scenarios without the expressed written consent of WolfAddict Software. Amnesia(C)1996 WolfAddict Software
