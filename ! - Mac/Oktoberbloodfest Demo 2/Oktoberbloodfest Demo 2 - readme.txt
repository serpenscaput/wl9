JMC has released the second demo of Oktoberbloodfest. Since I already ported the first demo back when it was released, I won't bore you with details you likely already know. Here's the link to the previous release if you still haven't heard about it. As for the second demo, it features five maps instead of just two, new enemy graphics, a rather humorous flamethrower replacement and some improvements to already existing graphics. It's a nice thing.
