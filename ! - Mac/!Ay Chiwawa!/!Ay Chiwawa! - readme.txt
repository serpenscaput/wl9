!Ay Chiwawa! is a single map for the Second Encounter by an unknown author. Truth be told, I don't know anything about this map other than there's something seriously wrong with it. I had to fix the orientation of every single door for things to even begin to make sense, plus many places appear to be simply inaccessible behind improperly placed pushwalls, etc. But otherwise it's theoretically completeable as it is, so you're free to try. Or just zoom around with noclip, I don't care. There's a bunch of bosses hidden around if you do.
