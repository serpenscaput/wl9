After all this, a mapset by Richard Peck somehow manages to feel like an anticlimax. But don't get me wrong, Wolfenstein for Dummies comprises four fine Third Encounter maps. If you're a fan of Richard Peck, you know what's up; if you're not, that's only your fault, but you can certainly expect uncanny rooms where wall placement and deaf enemy positioning work together to spring numerous traps on you, all in sector-like areas connected by very long, narrow passages with more enemies in them. It's classic Peck.
