Cool Wolf is another ancient PC mod, this time by Marty Belphegor. 25 new so-so maps and a new VSWAP, it eventually failed to make its way into people's minds. The Mac mod we're looking at is a much smaller thing, being a vanilla First Encounter scenario with 3 maps. I'm not sure if it goes by the name of Cool Wolf or Cool Wolf Levels, but it's similar enough as far as I'm concerned. Very quick, very small, but maybe that's what you need.
