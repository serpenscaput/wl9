BUGS-------------------------    A lot of people on the net have complained about disappearing bad guys, or see-through walls. Well, I've come into contact with a couple of these, and have solutions, and never come onto others but have theories.    According to the level stats, there can be no more than 64 rooms. You may not think that you'd use up these many, but remember that each room is a space completely enclosed on all sides. That means, that those little one block hallways count as a room. Might even mean that one square surrounded by blocks is a room, don't know. At any rate, 64 rooms is a lot, and should be all means satisfy most people's needs. I once tried to make a level which was a bunch of square rooms, and went over the 64 room limit. What happens in that case is the doors that separate the rooms get stuck half open, making the two rooms only one. You can't walk through the broken door, nor open it, but you can shoot through it.    The invisible wall problem is a very simple one in most cases. Any secret door can be viewed only on the side that can be pushed. Well, actually, all sides can be pushed, but only the wall is drawn on one side. So make sure that the secret doors always point away from you, and that you can't get to the other side without using the door.    I have no idea what the problem is with the disappearing bad guys is, but I'm sure it has something to do with the number of objects (not just bad guys, but tables, ammo, and flags, etc..) on screen at one time. It might help if you turn the music off, or use a smaller screen. On my IIsi, smallest screen, no music, I've never seen any bad guys disappear.        2. FUN WITH SECRET DOORS--------------------------------------    Secret doors have got to be the spiffiest thing about Wolf3D. However, they are also easy to screw up. I've seen several level files where there is a secret door, but no block behind it. This makes the door move back two spaces, and disappear, but still act as a block.+--+--=--=--=--=--=--=--+--+   Let's say this is a simple map section. |->|   XX    [] [] [] []|%%|   The -> block is the secret door. +--+--=--=--=--=--=--=--+--+   The XX is where the door disappears and becomes a block. The [] is ammo. Because of the funny way secretdoors are, the ammo will be able to be seen through the door, but notbe able to be gotten. Sucks.    So try, and put a block 2 blocks behind the door so that the door has something to disappear into. This also helps level makers make sure that all items are gettable, and saves some stupid mistakes. I once made a level where a door went back into empty space, and it was like a giant invisible wall was there. This can be used for some spiffy effects tho, like putting a secret door over empty space, makes an invisible barrier that can be pushed.    Also in the fun world of secret doors: Did you know that secret doors can be nested? Really,+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+    This works! The player pushes the wall, |->|  |->|  |->|  |->|  |%%|    and can push the one behind it, and so on. +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+    This is great for tricking the playerinto thinking that they've found a secret area, but there are several other secret areas out beyond it.    NEVER PUT TWO SECRET DOORS RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. Results are not fun for the game, but create a neat effect.    DON'T PUT SECRET DOORS ON TOP OF OBJECTS, BADGUYS, OR OTHER DOORS. WolfEdit only saves the door, and not the object underneith, so results suck there too.          3. MEAN TRICKS-------------------------------      A really great trick to really piss off the player is to make the lift a secret door. After going through a long and grueling battle on the level, and finally getting to the lift, and finding out that there is more music to be faced. Or you can make a fake lift, without the control panels, so it just doesn't work.    MORE LATER        4. SOME SPIFFY IDEAS--------------------------------------    Split the level into different parts. There are two different keys, so make the players find one key, then go back and go through a previously locked door, and find the other key. A good obstacle in the way of the yellow key is always the Big Blue Guy (tm).    MORE LATER        5. OTHER MISC TIPS-------------------------------------    Always make the elevators face in an E/W Left/Right direction. The wall has the controls on the left and right sides, and the elevator gray wall thing on the top and bottom sides. So the controls should face the player sideways.    Don't skimp on ammo. Most players are gonna play to shoot bad guys. Unless you really want the player to run around with a knife, place lots of ammo, or bad guys. Too much ammo is better than too little.    Dogs don't give ammo, so put a lot of them on a level short on ammo. If the player is smart, he/she will use a knife to kill them, or else be out of ammo. Plus, they make a cool sound when they die.
