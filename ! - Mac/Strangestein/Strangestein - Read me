Strangestein 3D   This third encounter level was done using wolfedit 2.0.4, Stratavision 3d and Photoshop 5.5 . I have change most of the characters, walls and objects. The characters were kept simple because they loose a lot of definition when the image is reduced but i think the results are still interesting. Check it out and let me know what you think.                                                 j58roldan@yahoo.com
