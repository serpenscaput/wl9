The first of our mapsets is called Mutants' Lair and brings 10 Third Encounter maps to the table. In actuality, there's not much I can tell about it. Story is, Hitler is building an invicible army of mutants and you need to infiltrate a top secret installation and kill the evil Dr. Schabbs... So a pretty straightforward retelling of Episode 2, where mutants will be your main (but far from only) obstacle. Tread carefully.
