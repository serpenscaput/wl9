"A Fucking Mapset" 
another steaming pile of shit by AstroCreep
7/6/2021

This is a simple 4-level long mapset designed for use with Macenwolf, built in
about 3 days.  Aside from the 4 new maps, this also features a few new songs
(taken from my Mac-Style PC Wolfenstein remixes) and a quickly put together
title screen (this is honestly probably the most vanilla mapset I've made since
2006 lol)

To run, simply unzip the archive into your Macenwolf folder and run the included BAT file.
