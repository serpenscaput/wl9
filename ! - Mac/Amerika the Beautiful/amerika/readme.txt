Amerika the Beautiful is a major release by a major player on the Mac modding scene - Laz Rojas. A large work with many new graphics and sounds, Amerika the Beautiful is somewhat unorthodox in that it brings you to the modern world, where a neo-Nazi, white supremacist plot is brewing among your former friends from the military. It also introduces limited aspects of realism to the game: instead of a chaingun you get a machine pistol and burly superhuman bosses are replaced with armed vehicles. Intense and difficult combat in well crafted maps await those brave enough to face the challenge.

If you're wondering why there's no music playing, that's because the author didn't set any. Play your own!
