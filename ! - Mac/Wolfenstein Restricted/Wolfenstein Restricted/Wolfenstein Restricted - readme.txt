Our main course is Wolfenstein Restricted by Blake Zuckerman. 31 maps for the Third Encounter, it used to be a WolfAddict release, sold for $8 + $2 as shipping and handling price. As you would expect of a mod sold for actual money, it includes numerous custom graphics. Almost all walls were replaced by vanilla-looking but entirely new textures, but more importantly, new static objects and enemy death frames give the whole thing an extremely gory edge. Expect to see a lot of severed heads. Some of which you can eat. They heal you right back up. Just don't come complaining if you develop kuru a few decades from now. Mapping is interesting but pretty inconsistent. Most levels are mid-sized slaughterfests (we've heard this song before, haven't we?), but there's a few tiny stubs and several obvious throwbacks to vanilla Second Encounter floors. Gameplay progression is intriguing, with many secret exits to find, some of which appear to take you to previously visited places.

I haven't discussed the story yet because I don't know if there is one. That's because there's no proper documentation attached; what docs are there are for the demo, they say very little and contain statements obviously untrue of the full version. For example, the readme says the full version will include many new enemies and weapons, but none of these actually show up. I suppose Zuckerman changed his plans at some point, or maybe the mod was never actually finished. Don't think about it too much, just go kill some Germans and drink their blood years before BloodRayne became a thing.
