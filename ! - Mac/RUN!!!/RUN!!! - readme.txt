RUN!!! is a two-floor mapset for the First Encounter by an unknown mapper. While the first floor simply throws a swarm of enemies at you in four huge rooms, the second level is noticeably better and offers a multitude of fairly interesting combat scenarios. On the flip side, it's rather monotonous in terms of wall textures... But that doesn't make it any less worth trying.
