And in a bit of a supplement to the previous post, we also have Castle Xeen Dungeon, a single map by Josh Mills extricated from one of his Compact Maps set. It just didn't seem right to leave it alone in there, you know? It's an extensive maps with much lower guard density than usual, lots of twisty but spacious corridors, but still plenty of combat for the bloodthirsty. Play it and watch out for red herrings.
