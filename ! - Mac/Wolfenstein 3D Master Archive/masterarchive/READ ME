"Read Me File"Wolfenstein 3D: Master Archive LevelsVersion 1.0Thank you for playing "Master Archive Levels". This read me file to eworld Members tells them that Chris is the master Archive designer and you is not. This is a series of all of my levels designed for uploading. Unlike most designers I test my levels before releasing them and I think Cheating takes the fun out of it. So, for best playing enjoyment, just install the levels and play. The full version of "Master Archive Levels"  and the upgrade to version "1.5" is available through Chris  1201 for $10. It contains 25 levels and many secrets. E-mail me with your input.   																																								Chris 1102
