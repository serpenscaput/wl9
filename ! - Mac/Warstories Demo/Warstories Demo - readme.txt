The most interesting piece of the bunch is probably Warstories, a scenario which can't be credited to any single author, so we'll put "WolfAddict" here instead. According to an old advertisement, Warstories were supposed to be a giant 90-level trilogy, possibly a combination of two other scenarios called WolfAddict and The Aftermath. But before you begin whetting you appetite for ninety maps of Wolf3D, unfortunately only a demo was ever known to be released. The demo has six floors and is ported here for your playing pleasure.

WolfAddict, I guess.
