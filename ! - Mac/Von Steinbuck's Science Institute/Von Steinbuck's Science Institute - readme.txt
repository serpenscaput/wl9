Von Steinbuck's Science Institute is a nine map long Second Encounter mod by Thomas Stys. The storyline is very brief but rather unusual: you are to assault a prestigious science academy in Berlin and murder Doctor F, presumably because he's been involved either in Nazi atrocities or some Wunderwaffe shenanigans, though the readme never specifies what his crimes are. The mapping is extremely tight, nary a tile is wasted; much more compact than Josh Mills' compact maps. Despite the very small size and close quarters, you will face multiple boss encounters among other things.
