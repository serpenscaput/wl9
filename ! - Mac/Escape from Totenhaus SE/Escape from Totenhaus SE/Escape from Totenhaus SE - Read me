You're working as an undercover agent behind enemy lines, passing yourself off as a German in a quaint Bavarian village. One afternoon, you're sitting in a tavern sipping schnapps and flirting with a pretty fraulein when someone identifies you as an Allied spy. Before you can amiably protest and offer to buy the man a drink, somebody else hits you on the back of the head and the lights go out.The next thing you know, you wake up in what appears to be the basement of a large mansion. But this is no ordinary mansion. This is Totenhaus (House of Death), the dreaded location where Allied spies are taken to be interrogated and executed, and overseen by a contingent of cruelly efficient Gestapo and Waffen-SS.Until now, no one has escaped from Totenhaus alive. Will you be the first?* Copyright / Permissions *These levels CANNOT be used for a base to construct other levels, neither can any of the custom artwork be used in other scenarios without the expressed written consent of the author. Escape from Totenhaus: Special Edition(C)1996-2003 Laz Rojasfilmman@earthlink.net; wolfdoom@aol.comhttp://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/3744/
