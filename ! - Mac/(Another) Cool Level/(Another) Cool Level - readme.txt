Let's move on to less expansive, but not necessarily less impressive releases. Cool Level and Another Cool Level don't have any known authors, but they're presumably made by the same person. They're frankly pretty simplistic (especially the latter), but reasonably challenging in their simplicity. You don't get swarmed and overwhelmed by guards at any point, which is not bad.
