The year is 1995 and you really don't want to pay $25 for the Third Encounter. Unfortunately, the Nazis really want to squeeze that money out of you, so of course you're captured and have to fight your way out. Along the way, you'll discover that there's a secret take-over-the-world plan brewing in Weinerschnitzel Tower where the Party of Five, led by Adolf Hitler himself, resides. Eliminate them and claim your victory.Return to Wolfenstein by yyr/Aaron Teplitsky consists of three main episodes and three mini-episodes. 3*8 + 3*3 = 33 maps in total, so pretty neat. They come with extensive documentation containing storylines, gameplay hints, order forms and tons of other, miscellaneous information. Wait, order forms? Yeah, these episodes used to be "maybeware", a term invented by yyr. Basically, once you've played these scenarios and enjoyed them, maybe you'd like to send $5 to the author. If you do, you get various bonuses, most importantly the three mini-episodes.Ah yes, the mini-episodes... They are three maps each and they focus on specific gimmicks. Arena Battle is pretty self-explanatory: you participate in a game show focused on fighting in arena-shaped rooms. In City Carnage, you are a lowlife murderer sent to quash a Nazi uprising, and in Maze Mayhem, you suddenly find yourself in The Backrooms a huge maze and have to find your way out before dinner. Carnage City is probably the hardest part of the entire RTW series.Speaking of difficulty, as usual for a Mac scenario, these sets are fairly difficult, with a lot of enemies all around. It seems like the further on you go, the fewer resources you get to eliminate the considerable opposition, and said resources are generally hidden away in secrets, so good luck hunting them. And then there's the concept of taunts: caches of resources that you can see, but never reach. And as for layouts, I hope you like 1-, 3- or 5-tile passages and square rooms, because you'll be fighting in those a lot. Don't get me wrong though, there's still some variety in these maps, plus some truly brutal mazes. All in all, if you want to experience the predecessor to Breakthrough, by all means have a go.
