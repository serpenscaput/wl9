Hey WolfEdit jockies!If you make your own levels and think yours are as good as (or better than) mine, send me your best and let me take a look!  I'll tell you (from my point of view) what's cool and what might need improvement.  Remember, I've designed over 30 levels already and beaten over 90 original levels designed by id Software.  (PC Wolfenstein, Mac 2nd Encounter)Also, if you noticed, I was able to put 2nd Encounter music in RTW using WolfEdit.  Cool, huh?  If you want to know how I did it, I've got a magic word for you.... ResEdit.  It involved editing some menu resources and IDs.  So now I have something I call 'WolfEdit 1.1a' sitting on my hard drive.  When you open the pop-up menu for music, all of the 2nd Encounter music is listed.  This is CRITICAL if you design 2nd Encounter levels, because having 3 repeating songs just sucks.If you're interested in finding out more about how I did this, or if you want me to e-mail you WolfEdit 1.1a at no cost to you, e-mail me.  My screen name is YYR57695.  If you're not an AOLer you can still mail me for info although I can't actually send you the program. (yyr57695@aol.com)AJT
