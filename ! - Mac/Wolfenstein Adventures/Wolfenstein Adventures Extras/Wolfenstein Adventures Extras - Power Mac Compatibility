Power Mac Compatibility IssuesIn the past, I've received e-mails informing me that Temple of Doom crashes on Power Macs. I tried it out for myself, and I experienced the same problem. Eventually, I fixed the bug that plagued Temple of Doom (the custom graphics weren't formatted correctly), but it's still not totally fixed.It appears that my levels are so complex, they overload the PowerPC code of Wolfenstein 3D. Wolfenstein sometimes crashes in Castle Wolfenstein, especially in levels with a lot of doors.An effective solution would be to use WolfEdit 2.0.3 to take out some of the doors. While this will reduce the probability of crashing, it does take some fun out of the game.Whether my scenarios will ever be fully Power Mac-compatible is a mystery to me.If you can figure out another reason why my scenarios may crash Wolfenstein 3D, e-mail me at copperfield@worldnet.att.net and tell me about it.
