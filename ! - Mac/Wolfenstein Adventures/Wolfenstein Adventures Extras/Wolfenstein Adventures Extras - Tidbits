Only included a limited set of walls and enemies. What most Wolfenstein players have.Second EncounterIf you payed MacPlay 15-20 bucks, you got 30 more levels, with more enemies, walls and objects, but no ghosts.Third EncounterIf you payed MacPlay about 20 more bucks, you got 60 more levels, which were actually 6 scenarios, ported from the PC to the Mac. Ghosts were added to this version.Commercial VersionIncluded Second Encounter as a scenario along with the other 60 levels, for a total of 90 levels. Cost about $40 in 1994. Now you can get it free.How to Install ScenariosDrag the scenario file to the "Levels" folder. Open Wolfenstein 3D. You'll see a menu.
