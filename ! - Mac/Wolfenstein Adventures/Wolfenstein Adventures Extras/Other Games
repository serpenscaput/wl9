Other GamesI've always had a thing for vintage games that were around before the PowerPC Macs made their debut. To this day, I still play old games such as Spectre, Prince of Persia, Monkey Island, Bolo, Crystal Quest, Lemmings, and even Desert Trek.However, I have been unable to get my hands on other games from the pre-PowerPC era. I am currently looking for the following games:Spectre VR (NOT Spectre Supreme)Crystal CrazyMission Thunderbolt II (if it even exists)Jump RavenIndiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures (released by LucasArts around 1996?)Tristan (the predecessor to Eight Ball Deluxe)King's Quest 6And for DOOM II for the MacintoshThe Simpsons WADAlso, I have Virtual PCª on my 266 MHz G3, so I can play PC games. I am also looking for the following PC games:Duke Nukem I and II (NOT Duke Nukem 3D)Doom: The Shareware Version (NOT Ultimate DOOM)Monkey Island 1 or 2Blake StoneQuest For Glory 1-4King's Quest 6If you have ANY of the above games, let me know at copperfield@worldnet.att.net. Before you send it to me, I need to know how big it is, if it has any copy protection, and any serial numbers.-----------I do know that most of these games WERE sold commercially and sending them to someone else is illegal. But look at the above games. Velocity, the company that made Spectre VR, barely exists anymore. I visited their site and did not see one trace of Spectre VR. Duke Nukem I and DOOM I were actually shareware. Nobody will actually care. All of the companies that released these games have released bigger and better games.-----------Once again, e-mail any info on games you have to copperfield@worldnet.att.net
