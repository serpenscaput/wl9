GUIDE TO "WHAT NOT TO DO"-----Keep this guide handy as you browse and play the levels.  I recommend that you look at the map with WolfEdit first and read my commentary, then play the level to see what I'm talking about.  For maximum enjoyment, print this document out and browse it as you play.  Just in case you didn't remember, I would like to remind you that I found the majority of these levels in the file libraries on America Online.  In fact, EVERY level before 2-4 was designed by someone OTHER than myself- someone who didn't bother to learn what NOT to do in level design.  (Some of the levels, though, have been modified slightly to further illustrate certain bugs.)First of all, you'll need cheat codes.  Why?  Because...1) You won't want to play through EVERY level EVERY time; you'll probably just want to look at ONE level.2) Some of these levels are impossible to finish.  Yes, they ARE.  Do NOT argue.Anyway, here are the only ones you'll need.IDDQD - stops health and ammo loss (also known as "god mode")MCCALL - "skip" the current level*BURGER - all weapons***if you "skip" the last level, you'll go back to the first level.  This applies to ANY level set, not just Lost Levels.**if you have First Encounter, you'll get the pistol, machine gun, and chaingun as well as 99 bullets.  If you have Second Encounter, you'll get all of the above as well as a flamethrower with 99 bursts and a bazooka with 99 rockets.I will warn you that in the real game, cheaters are losers.  If you can't beat the game without cheating, you CAN'T BEAT THE GAME!  However, for these levels, cheating's  okay (as well as necessary).Let's proceed with the level descriptions.Floor 1-1: Approximate bug count- 1 major, 0 minorThe first thing you'll notice is the ridiculous amount of enemies.  And then there's something you WON'T notice.  If you play the game you'll find out what: the enemies can actually DISAPPEAR if the room has too many objects in it.  Note that an object is ANYTHING excluding walls.  I once saw one guy boasting that his levels had "special effects like disappearing enemies."  This is not an effect, though: it's a BUG!  Also note: if you finish this level and find all of the secrets and treasures that the designer included, you still won't score 100%.  WHY?  Because this designer made the most common error in Wolf level design.  When you make a new level, WolfEdit places one enemy, secret and treasure at the bottom-right corner of the map.  Failure to remove them results in the inability to score 100%.  You'll find this error in just about every other level here.Floor 1-2: Approximate bug count- 1 major, 1 minorHere again, the ridiculous amount of enemies will cause them to disappear.  But this time you'll note how severe the problem can get.  Begin playing and use the "god mode" code.  Also, get a chaingun and begin to bring down the bosses- but remain in the room that you started in.  After you've brought down a dozen or two, attempt to move forward.  It's more than likely that you won't move at all, and here's why: an invisible boss is blocking your path.  If you care to know, the authors of this level failed to include an exit.  They obviously knew just how bad this level was!Floor 1-3: Approximate bug count- 0 major, 4 minorLocate the jail cells.  They are secret doors.  There are SO many bugs that can come out of secret doors that it's just not funny.  The CORRECT way to make a secret door (or as many call it, push-wall) is to place an arrow onto the wall indicating the direction that it will slide back when pushed.  Then you must: a) place an IDENTICAL wall TWO blocks back from the first wall (in the direction of the arrow, of course), and b) make sure that the player CANNOT see the wall from ANY OTHER DIRECTION except the one behind the arrow.  You'll see why later on.  Anyway, push each of the two cells; they'll slide back like push-walls do, and then... change into another wall or disappear.  This bug occurs because there isn't an identical block two blocks away.  Also, you'll notice that treasure seems to "form" out of one of the sliding walls.  This takes place because the treasure was between the wall's source and its destination.  The wall slides back through the treasure, revealing it.  This is another something that you shouldn't do.  The final bug is at the end of the level.  You will find what appears to be the SIDE of an elevator, but when you push it you will advance to the next level.  This is because you're looking at the control panel VERTICALLY.  If it is viewed HORIZONTALLY or from the side, you will see the real control panel.Floor 1-4: Approximate bug count- 0 major, 2 minorYou may notice some flicker in the objects, but that's minor.  The elevator bug is resident at the end again.  And about halfway through, you'll notice several doors in a row.  Open two adjoining doors and you'll see something weird that you can walk through.  In other words, don't put two doors side to side.  This level is actually pretty good compared to some of the others!Floor 2-1: Approximate bug count- 1 major, 3 minorThe enemies and bosses may disappear again.  Besides that, there are some secret door bugs.  The first secret door, located at the side of your starting position, seems to disappear.  The reason for this is explained above.  After you open the secret, walk all the way to the end of the corridor and observe the wall that looks like another secret.  Guess what?  It is.  Don't push it just yet though.  Go back through the passage that you opened up and go through the door.  Fight off or simply pass the bosses (god mode comes in handy, doesn't it!) and go into the next room.  At the end of the first little hallway on the left, you should notice a hole in the wall.  Try walking through it.  What?  You can't?  You're trying to walk through the secret door.. but from the other side.  THIS is why you don't allow players to view secret doors from any side other than the one it was intended to be viewed from; because they look invisible.  If you push it, you'll hear it slide back and snap into place.  Then walk forward.  You can walk through the hole but then, exactly two spaces forward, you will be stopped by the same wall, now in its new position.  Interesting, huh?  The final bug is once again at the end.  You will now see in further detail how an elevator control panel looks.  You will notice that the control panels are in a square shape.  Look at one of the corners and you'll see the two different faces of the wall.  Remember: the wall will look like a side panel if you look at it from the top or bottom, and it will look like a control panel if you view it from the side- but it's virtually the SAME wall.Floor 2-2: Approximate bug count- 0 major, several minorYou will see many more secret door bugs, primarily caused by the failure to place an identical wall behind the push-wall.  Also notice that the space given to fight the blue boss was pretty small.  This isn't a bug, but it makes survival extremely difficult for the player!Floor 2-3: Approximate bug count- 0 major, several minorOnce again, secret door bugs fill this level.  The main flaw of this level, though, is that the secret concealing the exit is too hard to find.  If you NEED to find a secret door to finish a level, one rule of thumb is to make it obvious.  You can do this either by using an object, such as a water puddle or dog food dish, or a slightly different wall, like a swastika wall in the middle of an area of wall without swastikas.Floor 2-4: Approximate bug count- 1 major, 0 minorThe first thing you'll notice is that this level is wide open.  Soon, however, everything will seem to disappear, including the enemies.  Why?  Because this level is exposed to the outside.  When I say outside, I mean past the edge of the map.  THE EDGE OF THE MAP SHOULD ALWAYS BE OCCUPIED BY A SOLID WALL.  If it isn't, objects inside of that edge could disappear; if the ENTIRE edge is exposed, the total disappearance you observe here will occur.  Do not play around in this level too long or your Mac will crash.  This is because you may have ventured off the edge of the map.  If the player leaves the map, Wolf3d will sometimes, though not always, crash.Floor 3-1: Approximate bug count- 1 major, 2 minorWalk down this hallway and you will soon see Nazis in the distance.  Begin to shoot and CONTINUE SHOOTING down the hall, moving left and right to cover the entire width of the hallway, until you can't hear any more Nazis.  Then move to the end of the hallway and make your way around.  After you pass 2 secret door bugs, you will come upon the discovery that you were able to shoot Nazis through the wall!  How?  Here's how: if there is a distance between the player and an object of about 10-12 spaces within a SINGLE ROOM, the player will be able to see the object regardless of whether or not a wall obstructs the player's path.  When you are designing a level with large rooms, make sure you remember this!Floor 3-2: Approximate bug count- 0 major, several minorTake the treasure and kill the dogs but DON'T move forward (towards where the dogs were).  When they are all dead, attempt to move forward.  Your path should be obstructed by what seems to be an invisible wall.  Now attempt to find a space in the wall.  (Yes, there is one.)  Don't push it, however.  Once you find it, turn around.  You will see something ELSE that can happen if you view secret doors from the wrong side.   In most cases, however, this shouldn't happen... IF you use the secret doors properly, that is.  You will also notice that if you push the secrets from the wrong direction, you'll be able to walk through the whitish mass that appears from the other side.  A final bug: according to the map, there is a push-PLANT right in front of the line of water puddles.  However, you won't see the plant while you're playing the game, since you CAN'T have a push-plant.  Finally, you'll notice the elevator bug at the end.Floor 3-3: Approximate bug count- 0 major, several minorHere you'll not only see something similar to the "push-plant" last level, but you'll also observe what doors look like when viewed from the side.  Open a door, then attempt to walk through what's left.  It works!  Also note that the side you're facing from the outside of the door is invisible.Floor 3-4: Approximate bug count- noneNo bugs here, but you'll find a more creative use of the Wolfenstein game engine.  This level resembles a race course, complete with curves and a little bit of scenery.  Run through it with the Shift key depressed and you'll find out what this 3-D technology COULD have been used for!-----You've just learned what NOT to do in level design.
