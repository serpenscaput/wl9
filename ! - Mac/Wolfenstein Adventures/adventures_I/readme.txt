I give you Wolfenstein Adventures, a compilation of scenarios by Josh Mills. They are described as fast-paced ones for players who want a quick thrill, and indeed, fourteen out of 16 included scenarios only have one fairly brief (which does not mean easily beaten) map. Another one has three maps, and another - a stupefying nine, for a total of 26 maps for the Third Encounter. As implied before, despite their shortness, these scenarios are difficult and will make you grind your teeth and shout in frustration many times, whether you die for the tenth time in a row or... press the wrong elevator switch. Hell, the Supercop scenario isn't even intended to be played and beaten without cheats. You have been warned.

One last word for the road: Wolfenstein Adventures, like many Josh Mills mods, comes with a whole bunch of extras included. I can't reproduce everything, but I have included every single relevant text file I could find, ranging from tidbits about his other scenarios to full mapmaking guides by Josh Mills and Aaron Teplitsky. One of those - "What NOT to do" comes with its own scenario compiling several maps which have different flaws Mac modders should avoid. I have included this scenario too, in a Macbin format. Of course you can't use it on Windows, you'd have to set up an emulator and get the necessary software yourself... But if you care enough to be interested in that, you can do it yourself.
