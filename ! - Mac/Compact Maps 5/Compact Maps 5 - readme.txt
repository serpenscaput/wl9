Today we bring you Compact Maps 5 by Josh Mills. Originally, it's a giant compilation of - count 'em - thirty three scenarios for the Third Encounter. Heck, it was supposed to be even more, but at least one of these scenarios - The Shadow Men - is mysteriously missing from the released folder. On the other hand, the majority of these mods have already been released for the MacenWolf project in various previous ports. After excising these, we're left with a total of 11 mapsets (and a few of them have a minor amount of new graphics). They are: Atlantis, Beavis and Butt-head's Dog, Fresh Prince of Castleview, Ogre/Nazi Blowout, Pinky and the Brain Conquer!, Road Runner Madness, Rumble in the Bronx, The Killer Yodelers, Unofirms, Wild Fat Boars and WolfMade.

By now you're probably wondering why the name is a lie. Well, simply because there's a lot more than just "compact" maps here. If you're familiar with Josh Mills' mapping, you know what can be expected of him. That is, pretty much anything. These floors range from tiny stubs to sprawling giants, with a wide vaerity of interesting layouts. They're always difficult, full of enemies, with a lot of bosses in the mix and many more Pacman ghosts than the average mapper is inclined to use, so watch out. In some cases we have slightly modified vanilla (Third Encounter) maps, and at least one WolfMaker level, but most of this release comprises completely new content. It's worth a go.
