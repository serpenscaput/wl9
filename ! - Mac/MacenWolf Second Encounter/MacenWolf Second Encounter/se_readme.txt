This is simply the untouched 30-level Second Encounter scenario for the original game. It features maps strongly based on the 6-episode version, but standalone creations nonetheless. All credit goes to the vanilla game authors. If you'd like to play these maps in a slightly different form with more of a DOS feel, I suggest the Second Encounter mod by Wolf3DGuy: https://wl6.fandom.com/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D_The_Second_Encounter
