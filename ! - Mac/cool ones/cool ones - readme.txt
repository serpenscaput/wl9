With cool ones we at least know the mapper: it's Xenocide 4. After a very small and brief introductory level, the scenario develops into two other, somewhat more meaty floors. A couple encounters in there might be tricky if you stand your ground instead of retreating and handling enemies at the chokepoint, but overall it's about as direct as a punch to the face.
