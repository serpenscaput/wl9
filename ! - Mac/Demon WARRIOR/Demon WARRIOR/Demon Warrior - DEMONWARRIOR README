Thats it.....Now just click on the DemonWarrior application and select the DEMONWARRIOR Scenario from the Levels listing.  *** Now even better.....Now the Floor is Brown and not that Generic Grey color...This change involved tweaking the artwork etc....plus a few other changes.... the end result is Fantastic.Much more Realistic and colorfully pleasing to the eye....Try it-You'll like it.***The Story :      FIFTEEN BIG FULL AND LOADED Levels...........New Walls...New Bosses...New Object Art and New Sounds make for New Game Play......Wizards, Enchantresses, Witches and Demons have joined forces with the Nazis.
