Thank  You  for  checking  out  DEMON WARRIOR                            About the sound PatchI am sure you will find this to be one of the best scenarios for WOLFENSTEIN you have ever downloaded.  You must use an unaltered WOLFENSTEIN THIRD ENCOUNTER, OR COMMERCIAL VERSION to patch.  The Patch will only work on UNALTERED versions of WOLF so if you have added anything to your WOLF you will have to create a new copy from your floppy to Patch and then you can dispose of it.  After the New Game is created, you can add the Cheat addons if you'd like to DEMON WARRIOR.  The Patch will create a new GAME adding the sounds leaving your original untouched......Put the COPY in the Folder I have provided....There is a Levels Folder here as well with The DEMONWARRIOR scenario inside.  With the Newly created Application in the folder....Just click on it and select DemonWarrior in the LEVEL selection.                                           ABOUT THE GAME                There are FIFTEEN BIG FULL AND LOADED Levels in this Scenario......New Walls...New Bosses...New Object Art and New Sounds make for New Game Play......Bushes you can go through which can hide things from view....Trees you have to go around and can use to shield you from Rocket attacks while still shooting bullets into your enemies....Statues which may come to life and take yours....Secret doors that are sometimes multiclickable and  sometimes may lead to strange or dangerous places....{ in one level...I won't tell you which one...a secret door will lead you to a strange room of sideways opening doors where enemies may seem to freeze in time after you shoot them...only to collapse and die moments later }  And as with the Daydream Warrior Scenario uploaded for Wolfenstein First Encounter, You start each Level in a relatively Safe Area where you can return for Supplies as long as they last....and there are always at least TWO DIFFERENT WAYS to finish each level...depending on the doors you choose or the luck you have.  Happy Gunning.......Here are a few Hints to get you familiar with DEMON WARRIOR.TREES:You CanÕt go through them.You Can shoot bullets throught the branches.You CanÕt shoot Flame throwers or Rockets through them.So, you Can use them as a shield to protect you from Heavy Explosions.BUSHES:You Can go through them.Bullets and Rockets pass through them.They often may hide or obscure enemies as well as Supplies, weapons, keys and doors.The CELL BARS, WELL and STATUES:Like the trees, you CanÕt  go through them but bullets can.Rocket fire and Flamethrowers donÕt pass through so you can use them for sheilding from enemies that use this firepower.SECRET DOORS:A few Secret doors may not be obvious (thats why they're called Secret doors)but most of them are relatively easy to find.....A wall that is different, Lights or objectsnear them...especially in your Safe Zone.  Some Secret Doors, especially the ones found in your starting Safe Zone, may be REPEATABLE.....The Jail Cell Doors in Level 1-2 is an exampleof this.  Some (Safe-Zone) Secret doors may lead to keyed areas......maybe good for youmaybe not....Try anything once.HEARTS:There are Hearts scattered throughout the landscape in DemonWarrior.... some will replenish your health in varying degrees and others will have different effects.  Try to find the Double Hearts.ENEMIES:Some Enemies are almost invisable at times....and many of them, being magical, leave no remnants behind when they die...ie (no bodies cluttering the landscape)  However, ammo and keys are left behind at times as the dematerialized Enemy rematerializes elsewhere.A good way to destroy harder bosses is by finishing them off with the BAZOOKA after pegging them with bullets and flamethrower.  Use the trees and similar objects for protection from some enemy fire.  Sometimes one of the ways to win a level is by destroying the wicked witch of the West........ and sometimes you can  beat a level without finding both keys first........Game Play Demon Warrior was constructed to be challenging at the easiest level as well as tested and planned out for the harder levels also.  A lot of extra testing was done to ensure that you would not be trapped in an area with no way out... If you seem to be trapped look around a little longer... you may find a key or an enemy may open a door... As you have or will notice there is a SILVER KEY......this key is not really needed to pass through the SilverKey doors but can be used in game play as such.........There are different ways to finish each level....some harder than others.......If at first you donÕt succeed........  Remember, there is more than one way to finish each level.  Start out on EASY  until you get a feel for the game and take it from there and if you want it REAL HARD don't use any secret doors in your Safe Zone.  All Levels of difficulty are winnable..... though the hardest is HARD.These are a few Tips that may keep you alive a wee bit longer.Happy HuntingAny questions or comments:  Email---> BeetLman@aol.com
