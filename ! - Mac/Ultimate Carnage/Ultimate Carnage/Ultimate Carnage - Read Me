Use WolfEdit to install Ultimate Carnage into a copy of Wolfenstein 2nd Encounter. I have tried to add a good balance between health and damage. if you find the levels too easy or too difficult you can always add or subtract health with WolfEdit.   One tip;  Don’t spend time searching all walls for secret doors as all secret doors have some sort of marking.                                               Joe695@AOL.COM
