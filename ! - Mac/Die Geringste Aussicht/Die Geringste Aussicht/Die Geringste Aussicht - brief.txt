die geringste Aussicht

You've returned to Castle Wolfenstein to settle some unfinished business with the evil Adolf Hitler.  However, there are some ghosts of past visits lurking in the castle, eagerly awaiting your return.  If you can get past these relentless villians, you can have a bout with the big cheeze himself.  A word to the wise....at times the best way to get away from ghosts is to trap them in rooms in which they can not leave.  Only then will you be free to roam the castle. Use caution, ghosts are not the only things the stand between you and the frustrated artist.

Do you stand a chance against the ghosts of Castle Wolfenstein?  
We'll see.
