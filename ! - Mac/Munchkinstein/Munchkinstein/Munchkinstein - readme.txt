Let's talk munchkins. What is a munchkin? According to one definition, it's a powergaming RPG player, removing the role-playing part from the name, leaving only a simple game of numbers. But munchkins are also silly midgets from the magical Land of Oz. Should be easy enough to guess that Munchkinstein, the mod being discussed here, works off the latter meaning. Over thirty maps for the Third Encounter, you will face hordes of lilliputian enemies with squeaky voices, and as the readme explains, the minuscule twerps are actually German children, captured and genetically modified by Schabbs to become Uberkinder. Kill them all before they become too strong of a force.

Where the hell did you get this idea from, Laz?
