A Madman's Redemption was received even better than I had expected, and I thank you for your very rewarding comments! I'm very proud of this second installment as well, and I hope it's as fun for you as the last one. I think the final installment is the best, but there are little details that need to be ironed out, and of course this one needs to be played beforehand. Here are some helpful hints:1. Like before, this installment is split into 2 paths. However, this time they are divided up by which part of the story they take place in. Also, they intersect in some cases.2. Try to keep track of which exits you have and haven't taken.3. In Chapter 2, be on the lookout for visual clues.4. Once again, read the story text before playing.5. Once again, be sure to play at a high enough resolution, so that important ingame text is readable.Enjoy!-compyislife
