A Madman's RevengeI don't know why I came back here. It's hell, and it was always hell, but I'm just not satisfied. However I got here, everything around me is pure chaos. I guess this all started with the letters. Someone too cowardly to sign their name claims that I murdered his brother. The only person I remember killing is Adolf Hitler, and I have no regrets about that at all. I'm not a killer. This can't be real! Those weren't the only letters I got. As it turns out, the mutant army hasn't been stopped in their tracks by my chaingun yet. It's growing. Intel claims that the operation has been moved to an underground barracks. The sick bastards are slaughtering their own men to turn them into mutants! A mutant army of that size would be unstoppable, but there may be an abort switch in the facility. If there isn't, I'll fucking make one! As if that operation wasn't dispicable enough, the Nazis are also building experimental nukes in this secret underground base. Someone with huge balls had better detonate them before they emerge from the depths and doom all of humankind. Unfortunately, that someone has to be me. How perfect is it that both these projects are hidden in the same secret base? The base is still under construction, so I know I can slip in unnoticed. Hopefully I can get my delusional hide out of there in time, too. This isn't just simple revenge! I have to save the world! I don't care what they did to me! Hitler is gone! Nothing makes sense anymore, but maybe along the way I'll find something coherent within this utter madness. In the meantime, which path should I take?
