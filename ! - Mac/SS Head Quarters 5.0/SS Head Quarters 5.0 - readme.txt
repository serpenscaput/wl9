SS Head Quarters 5.0 is a six-map proof of concept by and unknwon author, for the First Encounter. I say "proof of concept" because, despite the version claiming to be 5.0, there's a lot of stuff clearly left unfinished. Many doors lead to entirely empty rooms and one of the maps can't be finished (there's the elevator wall, but not the object). Curiously, there's also a two-item gap in the floor numbering, jumping from 1-5 straight to 1-8. I have no idea if an other versions of the mod were ever released, and this one feels like there was potential for so much more.
