3 Circles of Hell by an unknown author is a 3-level (appropriately) set for the First Encounter. We have some rooms and narrow corridors and even a bit of a maze here. Map 2 is probably the most difficult of the bunch because of the almost total lack of any pickups; otherwise you are provided with the means necessary to survive.
