Etude 4(10 Levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis scenario was made in my earlier years just for the fun of making levels and brushing up my editing skills. I believe I used someone's entire scenario as the basis of this one. I very much regret the fact that I don't remember whose scenario I used. If anyone thinks he/she should receive credit for this scenario, you've got it! Just email me.CopyrightsIf you do something with this scenario, just give me credit, and everything else is yours!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
