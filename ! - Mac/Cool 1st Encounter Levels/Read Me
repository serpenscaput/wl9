This group of levels for Wolfenstein 3D 1st Encounter can be distrubuted as freely as you wish as long as this document is included and the group of levels is left unaltered and is not sold for profit.  This group of levels has been designed to be played on the hardest level(Death Incarnate).  They are all beatable without using any cheats.  To install the levels you can use Wolf Edit 2.0 or do it the hard way and use ResEdit.  Remeber:  If at first you don't suceed, try again.  Hope these levels are fun and challenging.P.S.- Don't take the par times seriously, most of them are far off from the time it should take to complete the level.  Sorry but there is no music after 1-4(I didn't know how add it).If you really need them here are the codes(just type them in while playing):burger = all the weapons and full ammo based on how much you can carry.wowzer = increases bullet capacityledoux = no damage to you and no loss of ammoiddqd = turns ledoux offseger = gives all the keysappleiigs = shows the secrete doors on the map with your headmccall = moves up one levelxuscnielppa = no damage and refils ammo to capacity
