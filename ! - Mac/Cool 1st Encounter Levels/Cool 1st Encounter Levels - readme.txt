We begin with a twofer by Vikram Raj, an author who had already shown up during our Mac adventures - he made 2keys and Vik's Fun House, both very small releases (single map only if memory serves well). This time it's an entirely bigger fish to fry though, as Cool 1st Encounter levels and Cool 1st Encounter levels 2 clock in at 13 (though one of them is fake) and 12 maps respectively, for a neat total of 25. As the first one is dated December 1996 and the second one - March 1997 (as far as these timestamps can be trusted), I believe we can see a mapper's evolution on display. Starting from some rather unsightly and irregular beginnings, we slowly progress towards more structured designs. While mapping in the first set varies a lot as Vikram is looking for his identity, the second mapset is more consistent, with slightly smaller, tighter floors, with more symmetry, secret passages and somewhat more careful enemy positioning. Both sets are worth exploring, though to me, the second one represents a higher mapping achievement.
