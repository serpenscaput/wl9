Welcome to the factory!  As you can guess,  the evil Dr. Schabbs is at it again.  This time he is hiding away in a mountain fortress (or should I say, factory) preparing for an assalt  to end all allied opposition.  In his private factory, the doctor is busy cloning an army of cyborg assalt weapons.  Should he succeed, the world will be at his mercy.

You have been sent behind ememy lines as a last ditch attemp to save mankind.  Your mission is to locate the Doctor and end his evil plans.  Be careful,  things are not always as they seem.  I almost forgot.  Beware of the doctor's visitors.  They are rather tempermental.



Much appreciation to the fine folks at WolfAddict and to Greg Ewing for a fine editing program.  This is a mere tip of the proverbial iceberg
