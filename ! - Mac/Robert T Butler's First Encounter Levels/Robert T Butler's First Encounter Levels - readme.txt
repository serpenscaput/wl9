These nine sets all used to be distributed in one package; let's call it Robert T. Butler's First Encounter Levels. The aforementioned caveat is that three of them had already been ported and published before: these are 2-24-95 Bob, Eat on Bob's chicken and Eat on Bob's chicken II. However, the remaining scenarios are new to MacenWolf.

Concerning the remaining mapsets, Castle Nanner (4 floors) is probably the simplest of the bunch, featuring mostly square rooms connected with tight one-tile passages. Not a lot of finesse in there. Nazi molestation is only one level long, but it's more interesting and fleshed out than Castle Nanners; expect a lot of secret areas in this floor. NAZI OFFICE POOL comprises five rather extensive maps; they are generally more interesting than Castle Nanners (which I'm using as a comparison point for other sets in this compilation), there's a bunchn of fun combat scenarios as you are sometimes surrounded by enemies, or have to deal with intervening static objects. The final map with its open-ended design is perhaps the highlight. Then comez nazi playpen, a single map, which is not very large or very fascinating, but decent nevertheless. Reaching 100% secrets can be a bit tedious though. NICE NAZI gives us three levels, of which one is reasonably designed, one has a lot of rather odd "outdoor" areas, and one is a useless stub. And finally, nuevo nazi (five floors) is perhaps the most fleshed out set of the whole bunch. Its maps are small- to medium-sized and solidly designed, though there's still the occasional oddity here and there. Generally speaking, these mapsets don't overwhelm you with countless hordes of enemies and provide reasonable challenges with ample resources available, though sometimes you'll be forced to converse your health carefully.
