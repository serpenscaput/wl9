Untitled Page.text These levels were designed to be played on the First Encounter and need to be installed with WolfEdit.  Everyone of them has been played repeatedly, and can be won.  Some of them are indeed quite difficule.  Castle Nanner's 2nd level sports one of the most difficult single rooms that can be secured. If you find them diverting, drop some email at rbutler@tiger.lsu.edu-enjoy!Visit the Existential Ukulele at http://www.tyrell.net/~rbutler
