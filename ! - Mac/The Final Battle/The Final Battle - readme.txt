The Final Battle - finally something with more than one map! This time you get two. Still no author. In this scenario, you fight massive numbers of enemies and get nothing to fight them with, so I'm not sure how is this supposed to work out. Maybe you're just meant to corner stab everything.

Yes, this is God.
