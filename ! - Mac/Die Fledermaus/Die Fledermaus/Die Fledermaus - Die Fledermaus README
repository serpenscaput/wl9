Die FledermaüsA Wolfenstein 3D LevelBy Bruce W. Anderson©1994 Plastic Dashboard Jesus ProductionsDie Fledermaüs is the third of my released MacWolf3D levels. It's ratherdifficult, in some regards the most difficult of any of my levels. (notthat there are many...;) For those of you who may not know German, Ihave it on good authority that "Die Fledermaüs" means "bat". It's pronounced"Dee Flay-der-maus". I suppose a rough translation would be flying mouse.This file is for use with WolfEdit 1.0 or later and any version of MacWolfenstein. If you're feeling especially adventureous you can do the install with ResEdit. Not recommended for the feint of heartor those who don't like messing around with the guts of programmes. 8^)This level is released as NothingWare. If you like it, send me nothing. If you*DON'T* like it, send me your entire life's savings. Simple as that. 8^)Comments? Questions? Marriage proposals?Send 'em to:Bruce W.
