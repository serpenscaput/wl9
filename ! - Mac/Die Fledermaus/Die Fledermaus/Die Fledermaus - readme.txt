Die Fledermaus by Bruce W. Anderson is a single map for the First Encounter. It's about bats or something. Other than the funky title (which does not seem to refer to anything in particular; certainly not to the Spear mission packs) there's not much out of the ordinary here, just a fairly extensive map.
