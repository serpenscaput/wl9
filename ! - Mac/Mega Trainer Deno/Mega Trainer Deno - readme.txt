You thought we're through with Josh Mills? Think again! Mega Trainer Demo comes with no documentation as far as I can tell. A demo of what must have been a large vanilla mapset, it comes with 8 floors, which is still a considerable bite of gameplay. Mapping is focused on tight passages and long hallwas, but there's some open spaces in here too. You're also going to face a lot, and I mean A LOT of enemies.
