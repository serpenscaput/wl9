We also have a freshly ported scenario for you! Jon Wigand is a name familiar for most every Mac Wolfer. His mod called The Eagles Nest is a 15-floor mapset for the Third Encounter. No new graphics or sounds, just a mixture of maps, some of which are compact, with many close quarters fights with numerous enemies, and some... some frankly look like WolfMaker output. I can't be certain, but I have this nagging feeling. Nonetheless, even if some of the content is procedurally generated, some floors are certainly made by hand and from scratch.

Storyline: The Eagles Nest is widely known as Adlerhorst, Adolf Hitler's German headquarters, a bunker complex somewhere in the Taunus mountains. You're sent in to carry out a sneak attack, dish out as much destruction as possible, then escape alive. Fight your way from bottom to top, encountering more and more enemies and bosses along the way. Don't expect an easy victory.
