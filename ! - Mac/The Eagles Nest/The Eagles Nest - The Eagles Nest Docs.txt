The Eagles Nest

A Wolfenstein 3D First Encounter Adventure

The Eagles Nest, high up in the mountains of the Fatherland,is the strategic headquarters of the Third Reich.
Hitler and his most trusted advisors meet here to make plans of conquest for his goosestepping army of Nazis. Your mission: To make a sneak attack on this mountaintop fortress and get out alive.
You stumble upon a secret entrance to the Nest at the bottom of the cliffs. Picking up the ammo of several recently fallen enemies (snicker,snicker), you walk into the elevator and ride it to the lowest level of this never before seen complex. Now is when you really get to work. Fight your way to the top and show no mercy J The Eagles Nest was made with Greg Ewing's WolfEdit 1.1.
