Number one: dog by Ddor4, a First Encounter mapset with 5 maps. Said maps consist mostly of straight passages and rectangular rooms with lots of dog in them, though there are also some other enemies along the way. The fifth floor is the largest of the bunch by a huge margin, but remains similar in overall mapping style and design. No miracles here, just dog slaughter.
