KT Project 2002 is an eight-level scenario for the First Encounter. The readme tells us that Clubey (apparently a teacher at this point in his life) made it to entertain his pupils. Every map was made with one of these kids in mind, so the rooms are shaped either as Japanese characters, or romanization of Japanese names like Yuka or Akiko. There's a lot of enemies in cramped spaces in the first half of the set, but things begin to open up a bit later on.
