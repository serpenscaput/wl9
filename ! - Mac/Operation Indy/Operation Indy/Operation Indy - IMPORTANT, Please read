OPERATION INDY ver. 1.0	algiers, '41(4 more levels to come	Requirements		wolf edit		wolf ver 1.0			Important Memory Requirements												this will eat up a lot of memory, up to 12 mb of ram.  If it is too much for your computer, try changing the levels a bit.  Also, turn extensions, sound and other applications off.  There should be no other problems.				Setting the Scene					YOu are Indiana Jones (hope no copyright violations here.  YOur mission is to rescue the stolen treasure taken by the Nazis.  Set in Algiers, N. Africa, you must face 5 difficult levels.  Each level has one piece of treasure.  If you don't rescue all five, you fail.  The computer won't say so, but we'll know.  good luck.				TRADEWARE						I think it's rediculous to expect anyone to pay me anything for this, but I should get something for my hard/creative work.  Why not give me a copy of some wolfscen/application/extension, etc.  I have a PowerMac 61000 w/ 7.15 sys software.  For the Nice gift, via e-mail, I'll send you the other four levels, via e-mail.  I think that's reasonable. I hope the idea of tradeware takes off. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!! skavin
