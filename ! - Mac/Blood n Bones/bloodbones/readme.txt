Blood n Bones is another First Encounter mapset with a telling name. Say hello to 11 more maps of pure murder. There's piles of bones lying all over the place, and as for blood, you must procure it yourself by taking the lives of oh-so-many hapless Nazis. Almost all maps are very small and compact, but not necessarily short if you're going for 100% completion.
