When the Wolf Cries(39 levels for the 3rd Encounter)Some StuffThis is the one I consider as my first complete, coherent and conclusive scenario. Though I have not yet included any of my own custom graphics, this was the first time I included anyone else's graphics. You see, I didn't have the 2nd or 3rd Encounter till then, so all my scenarios were for the 1st Encounter!I was very much inspired by Laz Rojas' "Escape from Totenhaus", and hence have borrowed much of the graphics I used from it. Thank you very much, Laz!StoryI'll make one some day!CopyrightsThis scenario is free of use, but may not be distributed under any circumstances without prior written consent of the author, Clubey (but if you ask, I surely will say, "Yes"). This restriction will automatically expire when my site, "The Wolfenmania Chronicle", disappears from the web and does not reappear for more than 6 months. After that distribution will be free, but I will still hold authoring rights to this scenario. That means just give me credit!The custom graphics in this scenario were not created by me. They are mostly all borrowed from Laz Rojas. Please give Laz credit, too.Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
