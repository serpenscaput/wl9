The MacenWolf team proudly presents: the Democratic party!

OK, not really. Still, WolfDonkey by Phil Sharkey is is certainly a thing. A four-level set for the Third Encounter (I think), it has some unusual traits that make it stand out from the crowd. Specifically, I mean the completely abstract, wonky selection of new wall textures. You'll find anything from a negative of a sunflower drawing, through old-timey photos, to a mosaic of a child. It's a wild ride. And really, so are the maps, as the author suggest they cannot be beaten without cheating. While the first three floors can be handled, the fourth one may prove to be an insurmountable challenge if you want to go for pistol starts. Just saying.
