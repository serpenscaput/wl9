                                                     HERE IT IS!                      The Greatest Wolf 1st Encounter Challenge Yet!                                    22 levels of fun and gore!!    No if's and's or butt's about it...I've played over 30 scenarios now and this blows them all away!    I thank all of you that made up your own games, or just a level or two here and there. Some were really cool. Some were really lame.    I took some time and effort to put these levels together. And used all the ideas I found in the games I played. Yes, I am a Wolf Addict. Yes, I want Wolf 2nd and an editor!  {;-D  Anyway...    Tired of running into every wall to find secret passages? The walls are marked here. You know, the wall flags...One of them is going to be a secret wall.   (Blue Room is only exception.)    Sick of running out of ammo when you're told..."It can be done!?" I calculated it out. It works. And you don't have to be exactly perfect. Even Arnold misses once in a while. Just don't panic. And don't miss very much!!    Weary of the...Oops, design flaws??  I double checked and triple checked. It's Laid out correctly. There aren't any invisible Boss' you can't hit. Or funky secret doors. Or, or...or...or...    Don't want to use "Wolf Cheat" because the stupid thing is impossible??  You don't have to if you know a lot about the game. For the amateurs out there, go ahead and use cheat if you have to, you're only cheating yourself! You Wolf Pro's shouldn't have any real problem beating this set of 22 levels. It will take a little time. I like it slow and steady! Take Wolf Cheat out of your control panels folder!    Everything can be found, accessed, gotten to. What ever it takes, it is possible. Think a little. There is a twist on the secret doors once in a while. A small twist you haven't seen before!    I called it "WolfenMeister!" You figure it out!    If I recall, there is only one or two "Free Guys" in the entire game. I thought that since you get an extra guy every 20,000 that you would be getting one about every level anyway. Plenty and enough. Not enough?...Cheat Ya' Weasel! Pro's should finish with 9 guys...Every level! Pro's don't die! MUCH!  If you do happen to die, you should still be able to find a machine or gatling gun again soon to help defeat the Big Blue Boys.    The Story:    Hitler is trying to take over the world again from the grave. He controls his zombies from beyond the tomb. The 6th Reich is undead and well. The only hope for civilation is a lone soul, imprisoned by the "Big Blue Bosses." You are the only hope Obie-Wan.    The Reichswehrs' one and only job is to keep you from escaping to warn the rest of the world of Adolfs' plans. Your mission, (and you should accept it) is to kill everything in sight and collect all the treasures you can on your way out of Wolfenstien Castle.    The action begins as you find yourself in a damp, musty, smelly prison cell. You have been working on your escape now for...Oh...2 or 3 seconds when you notice that if you give your cell bars a good shove, it moves! You're out!! Oh Shoot...Dogs!!! Where you got the gun no one knows!!!! God help those poor buggers in your way!!!!! Go get 'em!!!!!! Good luck, you're gonna need it!!!!!!!    Epilogue:    I do hope you like it.
