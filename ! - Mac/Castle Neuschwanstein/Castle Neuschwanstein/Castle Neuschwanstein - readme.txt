First off, there was a mod called Road to Neuschwanstein by Barry Muslim aka the Vaultseeker. Pretty famous for its time, an early example of coding changes via hex editing, and of course 60 maps of peak quality. Well, Castle Neuschwanstein by Gary Mule isn't exactly named the exact same (most of these aren't), but it's still funney how they chose the name Neuschwanstein independently. Even if it's a real place. Anyway, Gary's mod isn't as extensive as Barry's, but clocking in at "only" 36 maps, it's still one of the bulkiest Mac releases in terms of floors. Mapping itself is consistent in quality, but fairly predictable, one distinguishing feature being a lot of 3x3 rooms, many of which are empty, but you have to go through them all anyway because some may contain keys. In terms of new graphics, I think I've seen a number of them elsewhere, but either way they have a vanilla feeling to them and they're mostly what you would expect to see in a castle. Same goes for enemies, though don't be surprised if you see Doomguy's snout somewhere along the way. This is this week's "major" release, be sure to check it out. And all the others too.
