The Dark Fortress is a six-map Firs Encounter mapset by Masahiro Iwakura. It features pretty basic mapping, with one hell of a maze map among other things. The final map is unusual and creative though, I'll give it that. The mod comes with documentaion, but it's all in Japanese, so I don't understsand a word of it. I wonder why Clubey never translated these? Probably didn't have the time. Oh well.

The Dark Fortress 2 features six completely different maps for the First Encounter. The levels seem to be more interesting all in all, though there's still a spot of navigational challenge, what with all the similar grey texure rooms in map 2. Then there is a 2+ version for the Third Encounter, which adds 3rd Enc enemies in places where, er they weren't before. There is also a stub of a seventh map, indicating that the series might have progressed further if Masahiro kept plugging at it. Shame it never happend.
