Etude 3 - 12 Levels for the 1st Encounter. The readme says 13, but it's simply wrong. Clubey developed this one in order to brush up his editing skills (told ya this would come up). Somewhat similarly to Etude 1, he borrowed certain maps from other people, but some others he made himself from scratch. I donnow, with the possible exception of maps 3 and 4 they all seems rather similar and familiar anyway - small, cramped, filled (if not overflowing) with enemies, objects and pickups, you know, the works. You be the judge.
