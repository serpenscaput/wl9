Escape from Berlin by TunaSpot (not OMJ): two maps for the First Encounter. You're in an enemy base and have to escape your cell and kill the enemy general. Standard fare. The build time is 45 minutes and the scenario was meant to be the start of something much bigger, something that sadly never materialized. Maps are rather small but decently done, with solid architecture and a few surprises along the way.
