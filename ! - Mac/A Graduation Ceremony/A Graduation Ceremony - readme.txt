A Graduation Ceremony by Tomohisa Kishihata gives us 7 new maps for the First Encounter. There is a storyline: you're about to finish education in the finest academy for special agents. To give your education a nice finishing touch, you're offered a mission deep within enemy territory. You can refuse... but that wouldn't look well on your resume, now would it? So of course you accept. The maps are fairly simple, of course with heaps of enemies to block your progress and a fair few secret pushwalls too. Enjoy.
