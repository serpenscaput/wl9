7.6 by Munj is yet another of those scenarios that came with no documentation. Five maps for the Second Encounter, the level designs are rather extensive and fairly complex. You will, of course, face some large hordes of enemies as well as multiple bosses; at this point this should come as no surprise. There is, however, rather more space to maneuver in compared to many other Mac sets. Give it a try.
