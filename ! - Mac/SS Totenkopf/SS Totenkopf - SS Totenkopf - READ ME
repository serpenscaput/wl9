           SS   TOTENKOPFHi there good buddy and fellow Wolfenstein fan."SS Totenkopf, Level 1-2," is based on the 1' encounter version of Wolfenstein. Yeah, I know that these first three levels are obsolete, and easy, and that the 2' and 3' encounter have much more high-tech stuff, and bad guys.But when you disregard the new spiffies (like night/day view and such) it all comes down to you, the weapons and the bad guys. Then it's all the same if you nail 10 ordinary guards with a gun or machine-gun, or if you nail 5 bosses (or Hans Grosse as the little cutie sometimes is called) with a flamethrower, grenades etz. IMHO.In "SS Totenkopf, Level 1-2", the sequel to Level1-1, you'll find plenty of guards and SS's. And they will be coming at you from all corners, so watch out and watch your back. The much-used trick of not rushing in, will not work with SS Totenkopf.There are not that many secret doors, but you'll find it very revarding, not to say crucial, to find the few i've put there. But do remember to clear the rooms from Nazis before looking for the secret doors.Another good advice is to concentrate on the guys, that are actually shooting at you, and to not blast all your ammo away at once. You can't be sure to pick ammo up as you go.I also highly recommend that you start SS Totenkopf at "Baby Bonnet" level.  Any higher level, without a good knowledge of the goodies (or rather baddies) I've prepared for your amusement, will for sure result in your premature demise.That is if you play it straight without cheating. I don't really care if you cheat. I tried it myself, and found out that after a few runs at you-know-what-code, where I let the Boss hammer away at me while I, with the speed of a migrating snail, was stabbing him to death (just to see if knives had any effect on him), all the fun had gone. Anyway since the customized levels are distributed the way they are, there's absolutely no reason to cheat, code-wise. Those of you who also figured that out, will agree with me.Oh yeah, by the way. You won't find any dogs to kill in "SS Totenkopf". I could have put some dogs behind, say barrels, just to scare you (duuh), but then you'll had to kill them in order to get the full score, and I absolutely disapprove of killing dogs, being a dog-owner myself. I simply can't stand to hear the whining death rattle they make.             I haf no prublems killen tjermans, but little nize wooffies I vill not kil.I would very much like to hear your comments. If you like "SS Totenkopf, Level 1-2," I just might make another level or two. I can be e-mailed at:para-vin@inet.uni-c.dkThat's in Denmark, Europe, in case you're wondering."SS Totenkopf" is a-ware, so be it, although I would really appreciate some feedback as to how far, geografically, this game has travelled. So be a sport and send me a e-mail.Although "SS Totenkopf" is supplied free of charge, you are not allowed to sell, lease, rent, barter it or in any other way make a gain, financial or otherwise, by distributing it.If you want to include "SS Totenkopf" on or in any compilation, it's fine with me as long as you seek and get my approvel. You'll find that you're more likely to get my approval if you send me a copy of the compilation."SS Totenkopf, Level1-2" must be distributed as a folder containing:1) The game extension. 2) The READ ME file (this text).   3) The Story So Far. (Text File)If U play the game, you agree that no claims what-so-ever (and I mean that) can be made to me regarding what-ever. If you crash your hard-disk, and all info there gets lost, it's your own fault.Finally I must give my sincere thanks to Greg Ewing, creator of WolfEdit.A big and heartfelt "GUTEN TAG" to you Greg, down under in the NZ.Also big thanks to Doug Ingram for giving space on his WEB site to the various customized levels.*****************Creator of "SS Totenkopf, Level 1-2, v.1.00:para-vin@inet.uni-c.dkJan., 1996.
