The story so far.*************You have escape level 1-1 which brought you from your cell, through the prison quarters, through the mess (and what a mess that was), through the guards quarters untill you finally reached the lift.You're now going to level 1-2.You don't know what lies ahead, but you know that there were not many SS's on level 1-1, so be prepared.And remember. You don't wanna be the laughing-stock at SS-Headquarters. It's no use killing a lot of guards, if you don't succeed in escaping.The Kommandant of SS Totenkopf, the infamous Gestapo prison and SS Training Facility, has lots of replacement guards and SS's for the ones you kill. Remember; SS Totenkopf is a SS Training Facility.The Kommandant is also awaiting an interrogating specialist who has come all the way from Berlin with orders from The FŸhrer himself.So if your escape fails again, do forget all you know about "Plan Yellow",  - OK ?************This text applies to SS Totenkopf, Level 1-2, v.1.00.************Creator:para-vin@inet.uni-c.dkJan., 1996.
