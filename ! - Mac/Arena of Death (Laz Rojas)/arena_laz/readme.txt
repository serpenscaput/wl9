The second Arena of Death is by none other than THE GREATEST Laz Rojas. Dating to 1995, I think it's one of Laz's first Wolfenstein mods, and it shows. 11 maps for the Third Encounter, they all pit you agains enemies coming from all directions on a map-wide arena. The overall shape is always very similar, main difference being in side areas and increasingly harder enemy resistance. You will go from dogs all the way to bosses, but is it worth it? You decide.
