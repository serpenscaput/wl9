You find yourself in the middle of a huge arena, armed with only a pistol and a few rounds of ammunition. Behind you is a small blockhouse with an elevator, but as luck would have it, the door is locked. Suddenly, you're surrounded by dozens of crazed, rabid dogs out for blood - YOURS! There's only one way out - find the keys that unlock the door. As you frantically search for them, you hastily pick up any ammo and medicine you happen to stumble upon along the way. And you know you'll need them, because the dogs are relentlessly closing in.

But even if you survive, the danger's just beginning, because the next level pits you against even more, stronger enemies. Worst of all, the search for ammo, medicine and those damned keys gets even harder. And as you take the only seconds you can spare to catch your breath and wipe the sweat off your eyes, you realize with an involuntary shudder there's no doubt about it - you're trapped in the ARENA OF DEATH.
