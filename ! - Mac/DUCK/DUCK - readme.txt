No introductions today, let's get quacking!

Quacking, because today's first scenario is called -DUCK-. Made by tomWin, this five-floor mapset offers some decent gameplay and solid map design. There's enough action not to get bored and more than enough resources to overcome any challenge, including the multiple bosses you'll be forced to face in later levels.
