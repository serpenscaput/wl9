Adrenalin IIby Blake Zuckerman(1 level for the 3rd Encounter)Some StuffThis level is designed for use with the 3rd Encounter, and was made by Blake Zuckerman, a Wolfenstein add-on creator of the past. It is very difficult to find scenarios by these first generation authors these days because all the veterans have long but left the scene. Blake Zuckerman's scenarios are also very hard to find.I hardly know anything about this author besides that he created "Adrenalin", "Adrenalin II", "Hitler's Domain" and "Wolf (Restricted) Demo". I have also seen other scenario names of his like "Adrenaline", but I presume it is the same one as I depicted above. If not, please inform me. There also was a scenario called "Wolfenstein Restricted Demo", but I don't know if these are the same ones or not. Please inform me on this one, too, if anyone has information.If you know any other scenario by Blake Zuckerman, please drop me a line at :clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jpCopyrightsSince this is not my creation, and since the author writes nothing about it, I have no idea whatsoever concerning the rights of this scenario. I presume that if you give proper credit to the author, you're pretty much free to do anything with it. Do anything at your own risk!!Well, hope you enjoy this!Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
