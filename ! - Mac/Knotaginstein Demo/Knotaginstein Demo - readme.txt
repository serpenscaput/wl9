Oh no, no again...

I'll be honest, when I decided to port the Knotaginstein demo, I was expecting something above average. It's a WolfAddict release after all. How about some new graphics, maybe not a total overhaul, but some wall textures and sprites? Nope, we got nothing. Only three maps and an episode thumbnail. What fresh hell is this, I wondered as I imported these maps using the editor I reportedly hate (WDC)? Well, turns out it's not so bad. Two out of three maps are interesting (if a bit short), the author mostly thinks outside of the usual rectangle box, and there's something interesting and unique about each map. Even the second one - which is basically a spiral - has had some thought and effort put into it, so it's not just a featureless slog. Well done.

Oh, and I guess there's a storyline. Your idyllic life is suddenly interrupted as there's a Nazi who needs killing. He's in a castle, of course. That's about it. The set was to include 33 maps, but as we've already established, only 10% of that is available in the demo. The full version was available for $5 a pop. I don't know if a copy actually survived to this day.
