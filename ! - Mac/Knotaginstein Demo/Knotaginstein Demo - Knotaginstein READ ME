                     *****IMPORTANT INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS*****Run the program "Knotaginstein Demo Maker" and it will update "Wolfenstein 3dª 2nd Encounter" v1.0.1 (shareware version) and make a new file called:  "Knotaginstein Demo".  DO NOT USE A COPY OF WOLFENSTEIN 3D, IT MUST BE THE ORIGINAL UNALTERED PROGRAM TO WORK PROPERLY.  The program "Knotaginstein Demo" MUST BE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS WOLFENSTEIN 3D, i.e., DO NOT CHANGE DESTINATION FOLDERS.Now a little bit about the levels:1. Gateway to Castle Von Struedle (Floor 2-4)  Just over the river and through the woods, is the entrance to Castle Von Struedle.2. Dunghiller's Web (Floor 4-2)  Just outside the castle is a building "The Mole" designed based on a spider web.  He used to put his prisoners in here to either break 'em or suck the life out of 'em.3. Temple of the Undead (Floor 5-1)  Among the followers of Korhauski are the mutant zombies created by Hitler's evil doctor.  Deep in the side of the mountain, you'll find their altar.ENJOY!!!The WolfAddict Software Team.
