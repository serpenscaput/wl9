AyapenCreated by Butcha(9 levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis is a scenario made by my friend "Butcha". It's possibly the only long scenario made by the author. It is designed for play with the 1st and 2nd Encounter applications only, so don't play with it on the 3rd Encounter.Some things you'd better know about before playing this scenario is the "magical sweetspot bug" and the "corner-shooting technique". Most of you would think that some of these levels are impossible to clear, unless you knew about these tips. I've written about it in detail in my website. It's in the Ultra-Tips corner, so check it out!CopyrightsIf you do something with this scenario, just give Butcha credit, and everything else is yours!
