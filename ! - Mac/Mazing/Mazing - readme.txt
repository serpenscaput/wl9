Neeext! Mazing, unknown author, three maps for the First Encounter. The first two floors both feature large, adequately confusing mazes, while the third one is the oddball, being a simple boss encounter hidden by a couple pushwalls. Still a nice treat for maze aficionados thanks to the first two maps.
