Scott's Revenge is a Third Encounter map that's left me speechless. I mean, maybe (like suggested to me by the esteemed Thomas) it was meant to be like some outrageous NUTS.WAD-type deal, but it goes so badly over Mac's enemy limits it's not even funny. Launch it and play with the 1994 Limits menu option on or off to see how it looked like on Mac vs how it looks like in full glory.
