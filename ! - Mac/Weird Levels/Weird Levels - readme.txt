And so we're left with - literally - some weird levels. Weird Levels is a compilation of four small First Encounter scenarios of unknown authorship. Called, respectively, Bothersome, Psycho, Shooting Range and Spiral, they add up to 8 (generally pretty tiny) maps. The weirdest thing about them is that you're liable to encounter a group of Hans clones about to rip your face off if you make even the slightest misstep. Basically, good luck and I hope you like the color blue.
