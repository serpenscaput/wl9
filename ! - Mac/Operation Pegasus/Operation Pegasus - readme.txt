Operation Pegasus by Matt Heim & Bill M is a five-map scenario for the Third Encounter (I think) with no accompanying storyline or even a readme. The five maps range from small to very small, but despite their limited dimensions you're going to fight a disproportionate number of bosses, and a bunch of regular enemies of course. A bite-sized Wolf snack for sure.
