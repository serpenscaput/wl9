Prison Break by TX Sirron aka Tony Sirron brings us 10 maps for the Second Encounter and is probably the most interesting of today's releases. The levels are tightly built and sometimes feel sprawling despite only taking a part of the 64x64 grid. The author claims that every map has its own challenges - lots of secrets, dead ends, bosses, ammo and health starvation etc. Enemies are plentiful, but not obscenely so. All in all, a solid piece of Mac mapping.
