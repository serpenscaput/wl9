The war has been dragging on for years.  Rumours have leaked out of Germany that the evil Dr. Schabbs has been experimenting on prisoners of war in an attempt to find a way of making Hitler an invincible man/machine.  You have been dropped within the walls of Hitler's hideaway fortress. Your mission is simple.  You have fourty-eight hours to find and destroy Hitler.  First you must find your way into the fortress then work your way through a series of levels until you find him.  Beware!!  Hilter is very well protected.

	     The levels get progressively harder.  Each level has characteristic day or night scenes so that you can keep track of what day it is and how much time you have left to complete your mission.  The last level has numerous bad guys and ample ammunition, but don't get overzealous....you'll need all of the ammunition you can get yours hands on.  The last level is fairly long, but a lot of fun.  Good luck!!
