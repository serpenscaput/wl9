Temple of Doom 1.5One of my hardest and cruelest scenarios ever created featuring...THE SHADOW MEN!The Shadow Men CRASHED WOLFENSTEIN 3D in Temple of Doom's first release! Here's the fixed version.About 30 levels long. Have fun! If it crashes Wolfenstein, e-mail me at the address posted below and tell me on what level Wolfenstein crashed on and in which section. If it won't even run, give Wolfenstein more memory.How to InstallPut the scenarios you want to play into the "Levels" folder. Open Wolfenstein 3D. You'll see the name of the scenario. Select it and click OK.BugsReport any bugs to copperfield@worldnet.att.netJosh Millscopperfield@worldnet.att.nethttp://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/1634/index.html4/10/99
