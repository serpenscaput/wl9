Etude 1(9 Levels for the 1st Encounter)Some StuffThis scenario was made in my earlier years to test how the WolfEdit 1.1 application works. I believe I used other peoples' levels on experimental basis, but can't recall any of the original names, author or scenario. If anyone thinks he/she should receive credit for any level in this scenario, you've got it! Just email me.CopyrightsIf you want to do something with this scenario, go ahead and do it!There are no restrictions on my side. I'd appreciate some credit, though.Webmaster of "the Wolfenstein Chronicle",Clubeyhttp://www1.linkclub.or.jp/~clubey/clubey@rg7.so-net.ne.jp------------------------------------------------------------------Appendix : Creator / File TypeTo play scenarios with the 1st and 2nd Encounter change the creator/type to:W3dE/W3dLTo play scenarios with Greg Ewing's splendid 4th Encounter (2nd Encounter installed) change creator/type to:W3E2/W3L2To play scenarios with the 3rd Encounter or the Commercial version change creator/type to:WOLF/MAPS
