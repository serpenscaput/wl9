Etude 1 - 9 Levels for the 1st Encounter. It's a very early mapset, basically a test release to see what mapping with WolfEdit 1.1 was like. Clubey says used other people's maps for the purpose of experimenting, which seems likely since certain levels don't seem congruent with others, style-wise. I don't know who made what originally, but if the MacenWolf project is ever completed, I might just find out then...
