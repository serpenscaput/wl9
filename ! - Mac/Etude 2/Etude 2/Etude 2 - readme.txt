Etude 2 - 6 Levels for the 1st Encounter. This one was also a test, this time to see how WolfMaker works, so what we have here is basically a set of six procedurally generated maps, later edited (or "modertaed") to suit Clubey's needs. Everything checks out with the exception of map 5, which really does not look like WolfMaker output. It does have the obligatory brown brick background in the editor, but everything else is inconsistent.
