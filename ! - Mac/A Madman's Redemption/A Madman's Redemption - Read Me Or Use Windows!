I'm overjoyed that, even during these times, there are people interested in 1990s style FPS maps, let alone maps made by myself. I eagerly await feedback of any kind, and I also don't get out much, so please feel free to write to me at compyislife@gmail.com if you have anything to say whatsoever. Here are some important things to note about these maps:1. These maps were originally designed to be played on the easiest difficulty setting. They are playable on higher difficulties, but I refuse to be held liable for what may happen if you play on Death Incarnate.2. This will be a more enjoyable experience if you read the story first, even if you aren't that kind of gamer.3. Whichever of the 2 ways you choose to exit in the early map will matter very much, as there are 2 paths through this scenario. In this first installment, one path is more challenging combatively, while the other one is more challenging intellectually. I won't tell you which is which, but I will say that you'll get a some of both kinds of challenge either way.4. Unfortunately, there are a couple glitches to be ironed out. In one map, door textures behave improperly for me (1-4), and another map will force me into MacsBug on some rare occasions (1-5). Save often.5. In order for important textures to be readable, you'll need to play at at least 640x400 resolution.Thank you once again for playing my levels. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed repeatedly "testing" them.-compyislife
