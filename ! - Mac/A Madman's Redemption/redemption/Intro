A Madman's RedemptionCastle Wolfenstein has always been a nightmare to me. This will be the last time. It has to be. The layout of the place makes no sense, and everyone you meet there is the ultimate incarnation of evil. At least the weather is nice. It seems like it was nighttime just a moment ago, and now I'm sweating all over the place. Maybe I'm just not used to this kind of fear. I sure hope I brought enough ammo, but either way, I'm gonna put plenty of holes in Adolf Hitler once and for all. Even if they lie and say he did it himself, I can't wait. Is he really building an army of flesh-eating mutants? Who else would be in charge of that kind of project? He can't be. It's impossible. Wait a minute! Damn, I'm already lost! What's that behind me?
