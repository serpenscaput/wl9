Here's something unusual. A Madman's Redemption, a mod with nine maps and some changed graphics (you'll know 'em when you see 'em), is not your usual castle romp but rather an exploration of B.J.'s mind. Sort of. And you'll find said mind to be a rather odd, abstract and mildly unsettling place that ends with a bit of a twist. Interesting stuff.
