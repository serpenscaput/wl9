New floors and sound!You wake up in the morning as usual, eat breakfast and go to work. After arriving at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, you notice somethings wrong--You don't see anybody on the way in. Thinking nothing of it, you proceed only to find a gun on the floor in the lobby, not thinking you pick it up. As you walk towards your office, an unknown man approaches you and shoots. Remembering the gun, you return fire, killing him. This is only the beginning.This version has all new sounds and textures! New sprites and items are on the way!!WOLFENSTEIN 3D DescriptionGame Type                 : Wolfenstein 3DVersion(s) Supported      : 3rd Encounter or CommercialEpisode, Level #          :Simpsonstein:Level 1-3Single Player             : Yes Difficulty Settings    :    Yes/tested at "Bring em' On!"New Sounds                : Yes!New Graphics              : Yes!New Music                 : No * Construction *Base                       : New level from scratch Editor(s) used             : WolfEdit 2.0 Demo, ClarisWorks, PhotoshopBuild time                 : 5 DaysKnown Bugs                 : ??The Story:See Above                          * Copyright / Permissions * Authors  MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additionallevels. ERupinski@aol.com
