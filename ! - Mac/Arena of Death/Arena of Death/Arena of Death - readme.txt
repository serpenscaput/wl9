The first Arena of Death was created by an unknown author. It's seven maps for the Second Encounter and they're unusual in that they all resemble (duh) arenas of various types and shapes. There's actually some fairly diverse selection in here. In the readme, Clubey warns potential players of possible technical issues: if you fight or kill too many enemies in one spot, the game could become overwhelmed and crash with a memory error. But that's not an issue in MacenWolf, of course.
