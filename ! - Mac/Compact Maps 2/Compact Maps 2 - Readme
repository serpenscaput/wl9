Hey, I TOLD you there would be another Compact Maps Set, didn't I? Well, here they are:Castle of Lost Souls Dungeon-Where it all starts. Pretty scary, if you'd ask me! Well, good luck in this one! Resembles floore 3-1 of Castle Xeen 2.0.Chamber of Torture- So gory I don't want to tell you about this one. Resembles floor 2-3 of Dragon Cavern Lite.Save the Lone Guard!- Resembles floor 2-7 of Castle Xeen 2.0. 99 mutants, one lone brown guard! Save him for last.Worse than Hell On Earth- You know Doom II? Well, this is 100 times worse, until you find the exit, that is! Resembles floor 3-3 of The Castle of Lost Souls.Ok, to edit these, you need WolfEdit. To just play these, you need Wolfenstein 3D 3rd Encounter or the Commercial Version and ResEdit 2.1.1.To play them:1. Open all of these with ResEdit.2. From the file menu, choose "Get Info for <the file you opened>."3. Change the file type and creator on all four to MAPS (file type) and WOLF (creator).4. Right! Close ResEdit.5. Drag all of the Compact Maps Set 2 to the Levels folder.6. Open Wolfenstein.7. Play on!Also available from horace@mail1.erinet.com (That's where you can e-mail me for questions, comments, problems, or ideas.):Castle Xeen 1.0Castle Xeen 2.0The Castle of Lost Souls 1.0Mega-Trainer DemoCastle Xeen 2.0 DemoDragon Cavern LiteCompact Maps Set 1Good luck!
