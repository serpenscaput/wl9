Jail Break! is a 12-map scenario by an unknown autor. Even though it technically has two maps, the four last ones are pointless stubs - evidence of a planned extended version perhaps. What's there (in terms of floors) is passable, though perhaps suffering from too much symmetry and too many mazes. There's also some new graphics, some borrowed from Doom, others being fairly simple edits.

Jailhouse is a three-map scenario by another unknown author. Short and simplistic levels, though maybe that's the point: to have an easy, quick romp through a few maps. Not my cup of tea, but I'm not one to judge people's preferences either.

The Jailbreak is a single-map scenario by, of course, an unknown author. The sole map is extremely simple, just a quick battle with some brown guards and dogs, then a boss fight. You have more than enough resources for both.

The Jails2 is a single map scenario by an unknown author (duh). If the previous couple mapsets were simple, this one takes the cake: you have a room filled with guns and ammo (but not health) and another room chock full of enemies. But you don't really have to fight them, as the elevator is just to the left and unlocked. You had one job.
