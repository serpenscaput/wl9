                                               Jail Break                                                 by Brandon/BJBB PW520@aol.comIt started in World War ][ and this is how it went.B.J. Blazkowicz was sent into the capital city and was taken hostage right away/that's how our story begins:You were barely thriving being the last of 100 hostages in B1-1 and only living off of dead prisoners bodys, there wasn't much meat left.You knew what you had to do/take the keys from the warden!. You knew from the start that he didn't want to be bugged cause he was mad enough having to live in a dungeon.One had tried before but got pumped with lead by the warden's chain guns. One day while you were devising your plot the warden recieved a package it was a 1856K Beretta the one with a Kasumi dagger attached to the bottom! you had heard about this weapon before in a breifing!. But,he didn't like it so he carelesly threw it out the door without thinking and went back to his buisness,you knew the warden was dumb but this took the cake!.You thought this was your chance knowing the knife wouldn't be much help but the gun would, and just to your luck the gun had some ammo with it!,but not much you knew that you'd have to make every shot count or you might have to run into his quarters and pick up some more ammo but then you'd be trapped!.Hmmmm?But then you rembered what the guy before had said right before he kicked the bucket! "He keeps an extra chain gun somewhere in there and a couple medkits just in case of such of an emergency!" Well today was the day that the deed had to be done! You planned on 1:15PM just after lunch you knew that no one can move on a full belly.It had been 15 minutes since the servant brought the food to the warden.How do you know you ask? Well after 1 year & 8 months you might be able to know time well!. On the way to the door you felt kinda wierd it wasn't the feeling that comes with killing someone no, you were afraid of dying.Everyone must have that feeling when they might be dying soon. You make it to the door you're in luck its not locked!.You slam the door open, boy this musta been a surprise!. {FILL IN WITH PLAY BY PLAY}he walks slow cause of food you were right! you open the yellow door with yellow key cause what else would it fit/what another door :sigh:walk up on a blue door need key /next floor meetings and living space /top floor load in final showdown or out then into next palace(BASE)/elevator in center of floor 2&3 why would they hide it?you walk back find a room with a few soldiers having a meeting  blah blah out of ammo you get the key/ somin temptin u to check the other door just your luck pitbulls and just a dagger/ embarrassed to eat dog food but only chance/ next floor/ ample running room for fight/dont se so search every wall cause you know that blah wouldnt lie and in briefing secret room discussion/ guards outside say what goin on in there! stab wit knife to avoid alerting other nazis/ final blow u think huh ahuh ahuh huh that was cool then u think bout ure friend that died he woulda said that ruled!/ could use clarisor you were a spy you knew his name 'hans'/killing someone you were friends with/you knew he was slow/you knew old palace so sent to knew one where u dont know terrain be killed by hitler him self for such a thing/surprise hitler/you knew hans loved chain guns
