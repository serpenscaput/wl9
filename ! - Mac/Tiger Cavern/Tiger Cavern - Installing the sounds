How to install the sounds:1. Make a copy of your Wolfenstein.2. Open "Tiger Sounds."3. Open your Wolfenstein with ResEdit, too.4. Open the snd resources of Tiger Sounds.5. Each id also has a csnd (in your Wolfenstein) that plays the sound. For example, id 161 in the csnds plays "Halten sie!", one of the guard calls. Look in your Tiger snds. Copy id 161 to Wolfenstein. Then, open the csnds, and delete id 161. Now, instead of playing "Halten sie!", it plays "Look out, there are llamas!" So, the basic steps are:	a. Copy the sound of the same id of the csnd you want to replace from Tiger Sounds to Wolfenstein.	b. Delete the csnd of the same id.6. Save Wolfenstein, put the original copy in a different folder, and play on!
