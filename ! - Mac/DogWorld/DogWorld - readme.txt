Number two: DogWorld by Do(u)g Ingram. DogWorld is a single, medium-sized map for the First Encounter. The vast majority of the map is occupied by a fairly large, open-ended area with lots of gray brick blocks in your way and dogs charging from all directions. Once you repel the canine onslaught, your progress will be blocked by two groups of entirely human enemies and bosses whom you must lure into the same area and kill without getting surrounded. Neat stuff.
