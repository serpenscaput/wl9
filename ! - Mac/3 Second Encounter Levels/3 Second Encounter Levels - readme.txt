We finish with 3 Second encounter levels, which is three levels for the Second Encounter made by GregoryC24. Strange how similar these names look like. The floors are fairly interesting, featuring both rather large, open areas and tight corridors, with German enemies sprinkled liberally throughout. According to the readme, the scenario gradually increases in difficulty and culminates in fighting every boss in the fame on the final map. Sounds scary? Nah, we're Mac wolfers, we fight worse than that almost every day!
