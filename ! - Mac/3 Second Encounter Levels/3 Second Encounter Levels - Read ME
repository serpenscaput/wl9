It seems that everyone is hyping their Wolfenstein 3D levels.  I'm not going to use expressions such as "maximum carnage" or "totally awesome level".  Simply put, these three levels are difficult and culminate in a fight involving Hitler and all of the bosses.  You can finish without cheating, but it will not be easy.  There are a few surprises and even some humor.  Send me some E-mail if you like it or find any bugs.-GregoryC24
