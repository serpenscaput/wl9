NEBOGIPFEL'S BEST OF WOLFENSTEINOK, I'll be brief. These are some of the best, and more interesting levels I have compiled for Wolfenstein. Be warned, some of the levels will require cheats to finish and are for testing out interesting techniques. (Bear in mind that this readme is also rather old!):The Boss Factory - DemoThe story was supposed to go something along the lines that the allies stumble across a German factory as an offshoot of the war effort which was construction mechanised war machines. You mission is to infiltrate the factory and stop production, whatever the cost.MixensteinSomething constucted out of pure interest, I wanted to see what would happen if you jumpled all of wolfenstein's graphics around. This is the somewhat intriguing result.*Cheats RequiredWavy GravyOrigionally intented to be a level in "Escape", this level is much more fun, and interesting, on its own.GoastContaining some of my more interesting graphics. One of the more interesting things to try is to attempt to open the doors at the top of each 'cubicle'. One of them actually opens!*Cheats RequiredEscape - DemoMy second attempt at a full scale scenario which died at level three. The origional readme reads like this (Beware of Language! The scenario is very old!) : CLANG! The door slams shut and you are thrown into darkness. Bleeding and tired you lie on the floor and recal the crash of your fighter. You remember a long walk through a forest, a big blue guy seizing you and a man in a white coat injecting you. Your memories of Wolfenstein blaze into your mind, Dr. Shnabbs! You must hurry to a hospital and quick or your on the MUTANT list. But what about this stupid locked door ...ComplexThis a very interesting scenario based on level 1-3 of wolfenstein, with a variation on the theme at the beginning of each level.HellThis is one of my favourite scenarios and it contains some wonderful home-bred graphics. Warning! It was designed to be especially hard!MeginsteinThis is my first completed scenario with help from my sister for several of the levels. Some of these were stolen for 'Crimson Kahnage', but they work much better as a group. Can you find the hidden machine gun on every level?Thankyou for downloading this set if levels and may you have hours of enjoyment and frustration with them.Nebogipfel'Escape', 'Crimson Kahnage', 'Meginstein', 'Complex' and 'Go Cheese' are copyright 2000 of Hugo Janacek.23845039257204570245830928430924809238430924809238409238409238490328490328409328493284093284309284092384093284903284093284239423000000000000090930493-044309854309587094357809438509348509438509348509438509467049670439657840967340967093467Ha-Ha!093478032759847598735403928403948093284903284092348902384092384902384092384392840932842309849234832948230948290489023840923489023480932480923849023840923840923849230483092840923432432
