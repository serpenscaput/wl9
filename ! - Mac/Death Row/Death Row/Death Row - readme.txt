Death Row is a mapset by an unknown author, with no documentation attached. It implies some sort of very morbid, grim scenario. It's also completely broken. Play at your own risk.

===Changes===
Multiple pushwalls had to be introduced and door orientation fixed for the set to be even remotely completeable. Fun, I know.

===Credits===
Ownership unknown and I'm not sure if anyone would want to own up.
