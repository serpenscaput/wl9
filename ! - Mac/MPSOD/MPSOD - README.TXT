This set of levels is made by MP Entertainment.What the hell is MP Entertainment?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MP Entertainment is a two-man business. Maarten Pinxten is it's chief andhis brother, Roel, owns the computer. We, from MP, make all kinds of graphical stuff: CD-covers, invitations, cards, posters, etc. Our specialty is gamelevels. You have now downloaded one of them (thank you for that). Wemake new levels for Doom, Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior (so far noplayable level finished, but still working on it), Warcraft II, Abuse, C&C Red Alert, Sim City 2000 (maps AND new buildings), Wolfenstein 3D andof course Spear Of Destiny.Well, what can I say? Visit www.fys.ruu.nl/~gerritsn and download some more.(when you enter the page, click on the button "friends" and after that onthe button "maarten").E-Mailing MP.~~~~~~~~~~~~~Of course we are still making new levels, and you will be able to play them.Please send your comments on the set of levels (or other levels, downloadedfrom www.fys.ruu.nl/~gerritsn) to the address below. Do you have hints or remarks for us? Speak, and it will be done.You can also mail if you have a page on internet and you want to put mylevels on it. In most cases, it won't be a problem, but I just want to knowhow and where. If you made levels yourself and you want to spread them, youcan mail these levels to me, and I'll see what I can do.Finally, you can e-mail us if you want to play more levels made by us. (theones on the net are quite old versions and I'm still making new ones. Alsoif you want to make use of our services (like invitations, cards, cd-covers)you can mail me. I'm sorry, but these things will cost you a small amount ofmoney, the levels are for free, because I just want to make a name.E-mail to:   rpinxten@dds.nlOr write to: MP Entertainment             Boshoverbeek 43             6006 LN Weert             The Netherlands(make sure you have put enough stamps on the envelope).

Do not change it and do not put your name in it. Don not spread these levels under a different name (saying you made them) and do not edit them. You may use themfor a start for your levels, but the new level must be very different from the original. You may the new levels you made with my levels, but mention my name and company or (better) include this txt-file with it.Enjoy playing these levels and I hope I will hear from you soon.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(Sorry for my bad english, but my brain is hurting to much already, so I don't want to spend more time on the boring typing job).
