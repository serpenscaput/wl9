There are no dead-ends, no unnecessary doors to push thru,  no lulls in the action anywhere in the entire scenario!!!Here are two unique and highly exciting levels of pulse-pounding, non-stop action for Wolfenstein 2nd Encounter! In both levels, you will be caught in the center of the action from the moment you open the very first door. There's are two whole floors of fire-throwers to pick off. You have a flame-thrower, so it makes you kind of even. There are also plenty of obstacles to hide behind so the fire-throwers can’t hit you. Easy right? There's only one problem: YOU can't hit the fire-throwers either, until you come out into the open!Enjoy!Game Type                 : Wolfenstein 3DVersion(s) Supported      : 2nd EncounterEpisode, Level #          : Fight Fire with FireSingle Player             : Yes Difficulty Settings       : YesNew Sounds                : NoNew Graphics              : 2nd enc.New Music                 : 2nd enc. music* Construction *Base                       : New level from scratchEditor(s) used             : WolfEditBuild time                 : unknown.Known Bugs                 : none                          * Copyright / Permissions * Authors may use this level as a base to build additionallevels. __________________________________________________________________Subj:  WOLF3D: Star Trek Arena          July 5, 1995From:  Cyber 1999AUTHOR:    Cyber 1999EQUIPMENT: MacintoshNEEDS:     Wolf 3D, 2nd Enc., WolfEditKeyword: Wolf 3D, WolfensteinType: Public DomainThis level has a Star Trek theme. You've been put into this strange arena full of enemies by an alien intelligence.
