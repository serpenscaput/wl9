We bring you They Will Hunt You by Cyber1999 for the First and Second Encounter. Wait, what do I mean by "First AND Second"? Well, there's actually five scenarios here, for a total of 15 maps. They are related to each other, for example They Will Hunt You III b is an expanded version of They Will Hunt You III, while They Will Hunt You 2nd Enc. is a version of They Will Hunt You remade to include Second Encounter walls and enemies. It might all sound a tad confusing, but you'll figure it out while playing. The maps themselves vary in quality, design and size, one common point being the high difficulty level and number of bosses. Some of these levels are giants spanning the entire 64x64 grid, but there's also a couple much smaller ones. Maps in They Will Hunt You are made from scratch, while the They Will Hunt You III series clearly have a WolfMaker origin. Lastly, They Will Hunt You III b map 5 is just a flipped over version of map 4 with some changes. That's quite a few caveats to mind, but ultimately, this set of scenarios is good fun for anyone who enjoys fighting Mac bosses a lot.
