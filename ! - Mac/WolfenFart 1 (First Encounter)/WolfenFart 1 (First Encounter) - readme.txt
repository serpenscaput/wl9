Now for another piece of good news: we're finally going to start porting the WolfenFart series! WolfenFart 1 for the First Encounter (by Taya) offers the following scenarios:

-fun with really long halls - this one is just a single really long hall filled with enemies and decorative objects. Not exactly the high point of this compilation.
-klabachutz maze - not really a maze, this single-map scenario subjects you to a really rough opening and slowly takes the foot off the pedal... at least until you reach the final room.
-Weisenheimer prison - five maps here. Taya slowly ramps the difficulty level up, and then map three comes along and you're suddenly surrounded by SS. Even if you survive this horrid gauntlet, the remaining maps don't pull any punches.
-Castle Winfenstein - is the name because this two-map scenarios is made of win? I guess that depends on your mood. If you feel like slaughtering preposterous numbers of SS, it's just for you. The second map seems to ease up at first, then you reach the boss room and all hell breaks loose.
