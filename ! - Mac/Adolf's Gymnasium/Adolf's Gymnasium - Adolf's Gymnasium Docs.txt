Adolf's Gymnasium
A Wolfenstein 3D Third Encounter Adventure
At last, a prememptive strike at the heart of the Fuhrer's military might has become a high priority for Red Riding Hood. They are sending you on what could be the most dangerous mission of all: To infilitrate and shut down Hitler's school where the toughest of the Third Reich learn their trade. Adolf's Gymnasium is the school for his biggest and brightest stars. Well, okay, maybe not the brightest...
Unlike previous missions where you have been utilized as a last resort, this time you will be the first string of offense. No more messing around. Your orders: "Penetrate Hitler's school and leave nothing standing."
Learn the secret of Hitler's fascination with the occult. Meet some of his vilest henchmen and raid the lab of Dr Schapp! Eliminate his plethora of muties before they have a chance to be used against the boys on the front! Last but not least, try your wits against Adolf's elite football team, Der Angriff. Most important of all though, get in there and have fun!
