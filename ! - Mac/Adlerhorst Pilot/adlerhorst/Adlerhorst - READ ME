                                          AdlerhorstHi there good buddy and fellow Wolfenstein fan."Adlerhorst" is based on the 1' encounter version of Wolfenstein. Yeah, I know that these first three levels are obsolete, and easy, and that the 2' and 3' encounter have much more high-tech stuff, and bad guys.But when you disregard the new spiffies (like night/day view and such) it all comes down to you, your weapons and the bad guys. Then it's all the same if you nail 10 ordinary guards with a gun or machine-gun, or if you nail 5 bosses (or Hans Grosse as the little cutie sometimes is called) with a flamethrower, grenades etz. IMHO.In "Adlerhorst" you will find 3 levels. Level 1-1 takes you from the earthen basement floor to the beginning of the concrete bunker system.Level 1-2 takes you through the Gestapo and SS Headquarters.Level 1-3 takes you through the SS living quarters.On level 1-1 you'll find only guards. Level 1-2 quite a few SS's will appear, and on level 1-3 you'll not miss any bosses.On every level they will be coming at you from all corners, so watch out and watch your back. The much-used trick of not rushing in, will not work with Adlerhorst.Remember also that the boss'es carry a golden key, but that the silver key is mostly found behind a secret door.There aren't that many secret doors, but you'll find it revarding to find the few i've put there.In fact, a few of the secret doors are essential for you getting on with the game. Watch out for any irregularities, cause they might indicate a secret door in the vicinity. Use your eyes, and you'll know in which area to look for the unmarked secret doors. And of course, when the sign says "Eintritt verboten", you always obey, right ?You find, that when you at last reached the lift, that there 2 lifts. Both are working, but only one will bring you to the next floor. The other lift sends you on a little detour.I also highly recommend that you start Adlerhorst at "Baby Bonnet" level.  Any higher level, without a good knowledge of the goodies (or rather baddies) I've prepared for your amusement, will for sure result in your premature demise.That is if you play it straight without cheating. I don't really care if you cheat. I tried it myself, and found out that after a few runs at you-know-what-code, where I let the Boss hammer away at me while I, with the speed of a migrating snail, was stabbing him to death (just to see if knives had any effect on him), all the fun had gone. Oh yeah, by the way. You won't find any dogs to kill in "Adlerhorst". I could have put some dogs behind, say barrels, just to scare you (duuh), but then you'll had to kill them in order to get the full score, and I absolutely disapprove of killing dogs, being a dog-owner myself. I simply can't stand to hear the whining death rattle they make.             I haf no prublems killen tjermans, but little nize wooffies I vill not kil."Adlerhorst" must be distributed as a folder containing:1) The game extension. 2) The READ ME file (this text).   3) The Story So Far. (Text File)If U play the game, you agree that no claims what-so-ever (and I mean that) can be made to me regarding what-ever. If you crash your hard-disk, and all info there gets lost, it's your own fault.Finally I must give my sincere thanks to Greg Ewing, creator of WolfEdit.A big and heartfelt "GUTEN TAG" to you Greg, down under in the NZ.Also a big thanks to all the guys behind WOLFADDICT.*****************Creator of "Adlerhorst", ver. 1.01.para-vin@inet.uni-c.dkJan., 1996.
