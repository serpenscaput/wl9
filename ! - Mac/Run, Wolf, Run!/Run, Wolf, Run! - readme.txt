And lastly, Run Wolf, Run! by Cay Boy appears to be simply an earlier version of the first map of Blazkowicz's Run. Cay Boy advertises it as an unique experience, different every time you play it, and it's true that the non-linear layout, coupled with enemies going after you, provide a lot of variety.
