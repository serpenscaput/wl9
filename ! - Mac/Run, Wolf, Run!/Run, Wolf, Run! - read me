Standing in a corridor and mowing the nazies down in one long line? Rooms full of bosses ? Not being able to win without the code words? Then I think that you will injoy this version.Run Wolf, Run contains only one level. There is only one secret door and it is very obvious. What is differnt about this game is that the nazies come after you. You are the hunted. The best way to play this is to RUN!  If you stand and fight,they will get you. Also, this game will play differntly each time you play.You will not need any of the code words to play this game. That would take all of the fun out of it.It is just you and them. Simple and to the point.  See if you can get a 100% kill ratio in under 7 minutes.If you like this game, e-mail me at Cay Boy@aol.com.If you do not like this game, upload something better.Happy hunting.
