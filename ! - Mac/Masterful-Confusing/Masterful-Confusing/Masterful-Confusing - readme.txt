Masterful-Confusing was made in late 2001 and that's the extent of my knowledge. Five maps for the Third Encounter, authorship unknown, no readme, no storyline, no more questions just shut up and play. If the title "Masterful-Confusing" sounds interesting and makes you want to play this set, well, it shouldn't dissapoint. 

===Credits===
The masterful author is, confusingly, unknown.
