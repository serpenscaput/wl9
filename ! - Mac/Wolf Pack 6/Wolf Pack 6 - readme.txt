Wolf Pack 5 by Andres Vialpando has four scenarios. They are:
* 4 easy steps to freedom has four maps. They're not only very easy, but also very small. A rather unusual bunch.
* Assault on Fortress A has one map. It's more meaty than 4 easy steps, but still not an epic adventure.
* Castle Hue (hue hue) has two maps. One is standard fare, the other is fairly interesting conceptually.
* Mixed Nuts has five maps. They're tiny, but in a different way than 4 easy steps. While the latter is very blocky, Mixed Nuts has lots of chaotic, single tile passages. Plenty of SS too.

Wolf Pack 6 has three scenarios. They are:
* Downtown Naziville has one map. A pretty large one too. Set exclusively in cozy wooden rooms, it does not try to challenge the player too much.
* Fort Can opener has two maps. Unusual name, but no unusual mapping. Get ready for a tough fight if you want to get 100% treasures.
* Lastly, Mission Hell has three maps. There's nothing hellish about it, but you can willingly enter an infinite loop, going from map 2 back to map 1, and again, and again. When you're fed up, you can go fight several bosses in the final map and finish the whole thing.
