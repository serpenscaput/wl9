		This is a set of three levels I made for Wolfenstien 3D First Encounter 1.01, that I made with WolfEdit 1.1.  To install this you need WolfEdit 1.0 or better.  I suggest that you use a cheat code or two for some added fun.  The set is A Real Hell.  This uses an abnormal set of requirements (more than 127 enemies total, more than 64 guards/objects a room). for this reason I suggest that you use Wolfencheat 2.0.1 (included).

      If you any questions, comments, or suggjestions, please contact me here on America Online at: THOMAS6413, or on the Internet at: thomas6413@aol.com, or on FidoNet at: Tom Rini@1:142/801 for more info.  

    Feel free to distribute this anywhere you want.
