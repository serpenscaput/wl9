A Real Hell by Thomas Rini is a 3-level scenario for the First Encounter. We have already seen map 3 of this set elsewhere; namely, in Maze by the same author, ported recently. You have to be particularly careful in map 1, as you can lock yourself out of victory if you don't know what you're doing. Otherwise the maps are relatively standard fare.
