Maze

This level is for the 2nd Encounter (Macintosh).  You will need the 2nd Encounter application to play.  The level will look strange in WolfEdit, but it will work properly when installed into the 2nd Encounter application.  This level is difficult but it can be beaten on the hardest diffuculty level without cheats.  If you need codes, WolfEdit, or more levels, visit:
