     This is a set of two levels I made for Wolfenstien 3D First Encounter 1.01 I made with WolfEdit 1.1.  To install this you need WolfEdit 1.0 or better.  I suggest that you use a cheat code or two for some added fun.  The first set is Hellish Fun.  This uses a normal set of requirements (127 enemies total, 64 guards/objects a room).  Then second one is Hellish Fun (Physcotic).  This uses an abnormal set of requirements (more than 127 enemies total, more than 64 guards/objects a room). for this level I suggest Wolfencheat 2.0.1 (included).
