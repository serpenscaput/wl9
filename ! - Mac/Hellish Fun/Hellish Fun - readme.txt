Finally, Hellish Fun comes in two variants: normal and "physcotic". Both are two-map scenarios for the First Encounter. The physcotic version has many more enemies than the Mac game can handle, but on MacenWolf with vanilla limits disabled everything should play normally. The regular version is the more difficult of the two, because you can't leave the starting position of map 2 and therefore can't finish the set. Presumably this is due to an oversight, or maybe it's a philosophical statement on the futility of life.
