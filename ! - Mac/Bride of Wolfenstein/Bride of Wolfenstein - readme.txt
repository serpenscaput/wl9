Bride of Wolfenstein Demo is a First Encounter scenario made by Clubey. While the title was inspired by the famous horror movie Bride of Frankenstein, said movie has otherwise got no connection to the scenario. You're about to face five difficult maps swarming with female enemies. That's the gimmick here: everyone you kill is a woman. Except perhaps the dog; it's hard to say with Wolfenstein graphics. 

Why is this only a demo? In the readme, Clubey said that further versions of this scenario (including more graphics and an actual storyline) are in the works, but he won't release them until he's receives significant support from other Wolfers saying it's OK to kill women. Since, to my knowledge, no further version was ever released (or perhaps even completed), I guess Clubey never received enough vocal support to continue with the project. I suppose people thought killing women is bad. Not a very egalitarian stance, tsk tsk. 

Oh well. Sans a full version, enjoy what you have here.
