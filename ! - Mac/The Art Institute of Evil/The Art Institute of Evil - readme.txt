Other than a collaboration with Alan Clem that's still to be ported in the future. Casey Renz has made two scenarios of his own. In The Art Institute of Evil (three maps for the Third Encounter), you assault the museum institute sorta place where the Nazis keep paintings stolen from all over Europe. Oh, and Hitler is there too, so you get to kill him, all in a day's work. And in the demo of Burn the Fuehrer (four maps for the Third Encounter), as the war is coming to an end, Hitler has gone into hiding and you must - surprise, surprise - kill him.

Both mods come with some changed graphics. In Institute, they're mostly a few real life paintings, which you're not likely to see in any other Wolf scenario. In Burn the Fuehrer, there's a lot more textures and sprites (taken from various sources like Doom), but I'm not sure how much of it you're going to experience. On the emulator, the mod crashes upon trying to enter map 2. There's no crash on MacenWolf, of course, but the final map appears to be inaccessible without a warp cheat anyway. As for the maps you do get to play, they're not particularly large or small. There's a variety of combat scenarios, some of them fairly interesting to play through. Lots of enemies, of course, especially in Instutite. And some desing choices are rather unusual, to say the least. You'll know them when you see them. Enjoy.
