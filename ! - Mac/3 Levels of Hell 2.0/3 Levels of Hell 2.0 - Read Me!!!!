		To Those Who Have Downloaded This Scenario,					Thank You for downloading this personal creation of mine.  It was worth the short time.  This is a total redo of my first creation 3 Levels of Hell.  I have redone all the levels and created a story to make it a little more interesting.  Here is the story-		You are a US covert operative deep behind German lines.  While on a special mission w/ your partner, B.J. Blazkowicz, you were captured.  After being jailed in a underground bunker for 2 years, a guard makes a  fatal mistake, and you take him out.  Now armed with a gun and your wits, you must make it up 3 levels to get out of the bunker.  Each level is a different part of the base.						Level 1-  You begin your adventure here in cell block A.   Make sure you check EVERY room for special items.  Go and check cell block B and then head across to the bloody interogation room, to meet the head interogator.						Level 2-  You have reached the power station.  Dodge through many circuit brakers to take out the Nazi's.  Again, check everywhere.   After you battle your way through the level, it's time to meet the Master Electrician.						Level 3-  This is the last level!  YOu start off in the storage area.  Look for many free giveaways.  But then it is time to hit the barracks and the dog pens.  Take out the garrison and head for the officers.  STraight down the corridor is the head boss himself,  Gen.  Musencracker(?).  		A few recommendations should be given. 			1. You may find the levels set on easy may be REAL easy for experienced players.  Try it on "I am Death Incarnate" for some real fun.      2. I recommend locating WolfenZoom.  It makes the game MUCH faster and much easier to use.  I have included a copy of this utility, use it well.Well, This is my second  try to please the masses with a WOLF 33D First Encounter Game.  I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU!!!!!!!!!!My e-mail address =rickc14@aol.com     .  This is also where to send any bug reports, so if you experience any bugs...WRITE ME!
