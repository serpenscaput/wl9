Now for 3 Levels of Hello 2.0. OK, hear me out when I say this release does *not* comprise souped-up versions of maps from 3 Levels of Hell. The floors are entirely new: small, compact and symmetrical, you could call them a mini version of Laz Rojas mapping, especially since they're much heavier on enemies now too. The release also comes with a backstory: you're a captured Allied operative who must break out of interrogation rooms and make his way through a power plant before reaching the barracks and facing Gen. Musencracker, the local boss. Go crack him then.
