Devils Kingdom is a First Encounter set by an unknown author, 8 maps. Things start out pretty interesting, with a lot of pickups to be grabbed and not as many enemies as in other Mac sets, but things slowly devolve towards the end as maps become smaller and emptier. The next to last map is just a bunch undecorated rooms with hordes of enemies and some health pickups. The final map is a stub that can't be finished.
