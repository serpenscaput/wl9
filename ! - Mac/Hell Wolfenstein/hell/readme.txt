This mod is called Hell Wolfenstein. Eight maps for the First Encounter, it was made by Clubey, with the last modification date set to December 30, 2000 (so it almost fits)... It's not actually much to talk about. Clubey openly admits this is one of his earlier sets and not particularly serious. According to the docs, some maps in this scenario actually come from other people and were then presumably edited... Unfortunately there's no credits in the readme file. Maybe one day we can track these down.
