Directions:Double click on DOGS.  Go to the FILE menu and click on Install.  Make sure to insatll it in to a copy of Wolfenstein.  Next,  double click on the Wolfenstein you just installed it in.  Next, have fun!                    *****You need WolfEdit to use this*****Notes:DOGS is a bunch of levels I made using WolfEdit 1.1.  It consists of 15 levels with lots of dogs.  It took me a couple of hours to make so I hope you like it.  I like it a lot.  It may be hard to beat all the levels without dying, but that's what cheats are for.  Here are the ones I use on these levels:IDDQD - no damage or loss of ammoBURGER - all weapons (knife, handgun, machine gun, chain gun, flame thrower, rocket                 				launcher), full ammoMCCALL - skip to next levelHere are some other cheat codes:WOWZERS - increase bullet limit to 999,  99 for other gunsLEDOUX - same as IDDQDSEGER - gives you all the keysAPPLEIIGS - tells you where secret doors are - secret doors are labeled with head on mapXUSCNIELPPA - no damage,  refills weapons to current limitAll you have to do is type in the codes while you are playing.Give the cheats to anyone, give DOGS to anyone, I don't care.  Please E-mail me with comments.  I hope you like it!
