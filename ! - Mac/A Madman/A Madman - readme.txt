A Madman is a four level Mac mapset for the First Encounter, relatively standard as they go. There's very little know about it (also standard fare), so only the maps can speak for themselves. I've shown them to the masterminds behind Witching Hour and they think it's either art or smurf pasta, so it should be interesting to find out for yourself.
