STORY

THE TIME IS PRESENT DAY AND THE EVIL NAZI EMPIRE HAS BEEN IN HIDING FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS.  AFTER THE FALL OF HITLERS EMPIRE AT THE END OF WW2 A BAND OF WAFFEN SS MEMBERS WENT IN HIDEING AND BEGAN TO RECONSTRUCT AN ARMY FOR ANOTHER INVASION.  
TWO WEEKS AGO THE U.N. FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS AND HAS AGREED THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS THREAT.  THERE HAS BEEN NUMEROUS BOMBING RAIDS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH LITTLE OR NO EFFECT ON THE SUPERSTRUCTURE.  THE U.N. DECIDED THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE APROUCH TO THIS PROPLEM WOULD BE TO SEND A SMALL BAND OF ELITE SPIES TO SCOUT OUT THE HUGE BUILDING AND ATTEMP TO KNOCK OUT THE MAIN SECURITY POINTS.  ONCE THIS IS DONE A LARGER ARMY CAN FINISH THE BUILDING OFF WITH LESS OF A THREAT.
YOU WILL HAVE TO HIKE THROUGH THE WILDERNESS UNTILL YOU REACH THE ENTRANCE OF THIS STRONGHOLD.  YOU WILL THEN HAVE TO BATTLE YOUR WAY THROUGH YOUR SECTION OF THE CASTLE UNTILL YOU REACH THE SPIRIT OF THE SWASTIKA AND KILL HIM TO PREVENT THIS NAZI INVASION.    

Level 1 Enemies

Ę
These guys are wussies but they will 
kill you    kill you if you take them for grantit.






Ę


These Rotweilers are trained to kill and they can too. Just give them a 
little boot to the guts and they 
drop like a bad habit.
  



Ę
Snipers are all over the place but 
luckily you can see them due to there
size they carry lazer aiming rifles and
they've got bullet proof vests.



Ę
Mutant bats are everywere too, they 
pick up pistols from dead gaurds and
they know how to use them.



Ę

   Officers are in my opinion the most
   dangerous of all, there really quick
 and theve got good aim.




   These Security War Droids are on tracks
 that makes them pretty slow, But there
 two chainguns make them pretty
 powerfull.

Ę                                         
 Grosse Vader (big father) is one of the
 Main men behind the huge nazi invation.
 he's not as mean as he looks but he has
 a pretty big army.



Ę 
  Mr. Barnacle is quite a force to be
  recond with and he don't take no 
S@#$ off anyone.



Ę

Ahh! The Ubermutant isn't much he's 
only got two big a$$ chain guns and 
can run faster than a dog.


Ę
General bada$$, He was from the 
original wolf3d pc version and I 
wanted to put him in the mac version
,he does have another name but I forget
it.

Ę   
The Spirit of the swastika.  He is The
drive of the bad nazi's he is in armor 
here but he looses it if you can blow 
it off.

Level 2 Enemies   

 Hints 

This section should be used only if you can't figure a level out.  This should be used before you use cheating.  cheating sort of takes the fun and challenge out of the game.


1-1The Entrance: This is the first level and it's pretty short, it only has one key and few enemies.

1-2 houseing floor: This is a level that you don't even have to play if you can find out how, it's in the elevator.  There is a cool secret in it though.

1-3 Meeting floor: This is when you start to see some of the cool stuff in the lost castle.  This has a difficulty of about 4.  There's more gaurds but they don't hide very good.  When you get to end of the maze part there is a room where you get the gold key don't fire your gun in this room or your in crap.

1-4 Security blockade: The difficulty is about 4 only because there is a security war droid in it.  He's easy to kill if you bait him out into an open space.  You can get two sniper rifles if you go in the secret room in the cross (the door is diskised to look like a wall).

1-5 You vs Grosse Vader: Grosse Vader is in this level and he's got an army for security.  There are open places so he isn't hard to kill once his henchmen are gone.

2-1 Grosse Vader's House: This is Vader's house and he didn't take all of his men with him.  There are alot of unecessary areas to go in this level so don't go in the places were there is glassed walls.

2-2 bunker: not too had once you get the silver key

This is as far as the help section goes because I'm getting lazy.     

 INFO

Hi I am Alan Clem You may be wondering were I got my Graphics for this.  Well I'm not going to lye to you.  I got some of them from the original wolfenstein PC scenarios including the lost episodes.  I also got some from the original Mac version of the game.  Also I have to give credit to doom and doom 2 because I got some from doom.  I edited most of them so they don't look exacly the same as the original.
I was Inspired to make This scenario by  the PC scenarios "The Lost Castle".
All of the levels were made from scratch using wolfedit 2.  If you Like, dislike or want anything to say to me Please by all means e-mail me at clemclan@glinx.com I will soon be on ICQ so you can look me up there too.  I am from morden N.S, ca.
