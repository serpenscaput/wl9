And finally, Dungeon of Dogs is another single First Encounter floor by Patorei. Yes, dogs are sprinkled all over this extensive map, but there's plenty of other enemies to keep things fresh. Generally speaking, the level is highly decorated and designed in a very chaotic way, giving the impression of a place created by natural processes rather than by human hand (although wall textures, obviously, indicate otherwise). It's interesting and worth checking out.
