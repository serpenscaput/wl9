The mission?  Kill Hitler before the Allies capture Berlin.  We do not want him to escape on the basis of diplomatic immunity.  Make it look like a suicide, so as for no blame to fall upon the United States Government.  Unfortunately, a leak in your Marine Troop has gotten you captured inside Berlin borders.  You have been imprisoned deep under Hitler's bunker.  	When you wake up, you see the guard bending over to place your meal on the ground beside you.  He has not seen you are awake yet, so you slip your Bowie knife out from your shoe, and stab him in the back!  You steal his pistol, and get ready to exit your prison cell.  Your only thoughts are to escape to the surface, and maybe kick some @$$ on the way...E-mail me and tell me what you think of my mission, and tell me if I should make more.  These are only the first 3 levels of Escape to Surface, althought there is a secret level I'm sure you'll enjoy if you find it.  It's a breeding grounds for those damn German Shepherds!  I'm planning on making this atleast 9 levels long.Please give me feedback, thank you.
