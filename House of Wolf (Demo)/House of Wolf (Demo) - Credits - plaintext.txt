				Get Psyched!
	Hi Wolfers!  My name is NJ Sinnott and I'm behind it all.  even behind Gerolf Stein 
--the man himself.  Thanks mainly go out to the players, who have come to enjoy my 
Wolf 3-D sequel.  My goal was to make a Wolfenstein mod (modification) that had a 
slight touch to the coding, but would also have a glance at the classic Wolf 3-D. 
 I hope I succeeded, because to me, it's anything for the players.  

	And now, a message for the fellow 				           "editors" out there...
	There is no trademark on anything but my dignity, so therefore,  feel free to do 
anything to my game, i.e. edit or use my levels, take sprites from the game, (it's 
a classic, so you probably won't find too much) use the sounds, (apply to last parenthesis) 
whatever you guys want to do.  Just remember to mention the credit if you use this 
game in anyway.  PS:  I will hopefully be releasing the source code sometime soon. 



	Now go kill some nazis, soldiers!

	Sincerely,

	NJ Sinnott (Wolf-Einstein)
