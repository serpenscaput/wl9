A more violent Wolf 3-D. 


Make a backup of the VSWAP.WL1 file before replacing this VSWAP.WL1 file. You 
should have EMS (as shown at the startup screen). If you have none, don't try
it. 
 This violent vswap.wl1 file was made using WOLFEDIT 2.0, which was written
by Bill Kirby. 
 This is for the first level only. 

 First: Type md c:\vswap copy c:\wolf3d\vswap.wl1 c:\vswap

 Now: copy "VSWAP" to c:\wolf3d .   And rename "VSWAP" "VSWAP.WL1"
 If this doesn't work, shuch as the game locks, just type COPY C:\VSWAP\VSWAP.WL1 
c:\wolf3d
 It's that easy. Thanks,

Who's face is that? Well, it's my brothers, We look a little bit alike (we are
identical twins) but he is more ugly (just kidding, Rich).
