Final TFS
-by Tristan

Intro
------------------
Well, after hounding me for 6 years or so to release an SDL version of TFS, Thomas Weiling finally got me going. Thanks to MCS, who still had the SDL source code lying around, this new version was made possible.

It's an overhaul of the original TFS2.0 - because I have no idea what I was thinking when I made 3.0, but that version was pretty crappy. Not saying that Final TFS is a better rendition, but still - it's called Final TFS because after this I won't look at it again. ;-)

Have fun playing!
