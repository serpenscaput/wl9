			<P>To get the Gold Key enter the heavily infested grey stone structure or fight 
a Grosse brother later. Go by the red brick section or down the blue corridor. Each 
of the two sets of pushwalls will open one path while eliminating the other. Either 
way will get you past the row of armours down south. Enter the western part. Suddenly 
ghosts come at you from seemingly nowhere. Watch out for the patrolling officers. 
Deep within this area Grosse and several SS await. Find powerups in secret rooms. 
The SS in the southern locked room may open a shortcut for you, with this episode's 
first chaingun, a 1-up plus two more SS. The Dead Guard trick will stop the ghosts, 
but if you don't possess a Gold Key by now you have a problem. The passage back is 
through the grey maze, but a pushwall blocks the entrance. There is a solution: Another 
pushwall opens a secret passage within the wall itself. Make it to the north end 
of the panel section and fight the SS for the Silver Key. Go back and past the silver 
key door in the center. Powerups here? and what a strange elevator room. Push the 
wall. With the ghosts at your heels you're in trouble!</P>
