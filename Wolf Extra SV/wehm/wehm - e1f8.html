			<P>This opening is even tougher. Kill the SS, get the goods and prove your worth. 
They are coming from both sides.<BR>
			The Gold Key is behind a pushwall near the entrance.<BR>
			Eliminate quickly the guards when you get to the gallery of armours. There are 
SS and officers behind them.<BR>
			Get ready for more heavy fighting in the southern and central parts.<BR>
			The Silver Key is in a secret room not far from the entrance but accessed through 
the central area.</P>
			<P>There are two 1-ups in this level, locate them before eventually pushing the 
wall in the north-western corner. Then get ready for floor 9.</P>
