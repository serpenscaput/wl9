			<P>It seems you are intruding upon a Grosse family conference. They reward such 
impudence in their accustomed manner. Apparently one of them left a chaingun right 
were you start. So why don't you pick it up and give them some of their own stuff! 
You have to defeat at least one Grosse to get onward past one of the gold key doors. 
But it might be a good idea to finish with them all. Once you get the Gold Key you 
have four choices. The northern section is not so dangerous. The three others are 
rather tough. In the eastern section get involved in a desperate fight to get past 
the barrels. In the southern section be constantly on the move firing in every direction 
to get through this confusing maze. In the western section be prepared for a quick 
ending. So keep your nerves under control and try not to get lost in this terrible 
mutant infested vine maze. Whichever you choose you will eventually end up in one 
of the two corner rooms that are holding Silver Keys. Entering one section does not 
eliminate the possibility of entering any of the others later. Finish by fighting 
a fifth Grosse and four SS before entering the elevator. 1-ups are found in all of 
the sections.</P>
