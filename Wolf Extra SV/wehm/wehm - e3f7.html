			<P>Push the wall ahead and make it to the Gold Key. Then move to the gallery of 
columns, fighting off guards and officers. Look out for the officers and SS behind 
the columns. Beyond the gold key door you get on to the elevator. In the north you 
find areas with lots of treasure, plus many SS. If you follow the long corridor you 
end up by a 1-up. Somewhere ahead you see a mysterious hidden room. Fire a shot and 
hear some officers' warning, but nothing happens. Near the room with the Gold Key 
is an entrance to the officers' room. From here you get to the secret green moss 
area with mutants. Here are many pushwalls, some eliminate the use of others. Push 
the golden eagle. This path involves fighting lots of mutants as well as other enemies. 
Find the Silver Key in a room back into the panel section. Push a wall to reveal 
the silver key door next to the secret elevator. Alternately push another set of 
walls near the golden eagle. This takes you to the outdoor area. Push the wall with 
the sign plus others to get another Silver Key hidden in the panel section. Then 
make it to the same secret elevator entrance, this time from the north.	<A HREF=e3f7_2.html>next
