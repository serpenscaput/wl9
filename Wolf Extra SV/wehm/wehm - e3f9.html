			<P>Prepare for the last level of Wolf-Extra. Open the door and take the chaingun, 
then turn right and run past wall blocks and columns while being blasted from all 
sides. Pick up ammo and deliver some in return, but be on the move! There is a pushwall 
by the health, behind it is the Gold Key and more health. More powerups are found 
on the other side. But don't wait too long to make it into the hallway. Only to be 
confronted by two Fake Hitlers. Deal with them but watch out for the officers. Find 
ammo in adjacent rooms, health behind pushwalls. The enemies may follow you, continue 
fighting and grabbing their ammo, enter the first room and finish the rest. At this 
point you are low on everything. Make it past two more Fake Hitlers and enter the 
grey room. Hold your fire and reinforce. You thought the first section was hard, 
get ready for the room of death. Fire a shot and have them all come. Fight like never 
before. You may make it back to the panel area, but enemies are pouring out from 
every-place now. AND REMEBER: You must get into one of the northern rooms to get 
a Silver Key while a silver key door is open!	<A HREF=e3f9_2.html>next page</A></P>
