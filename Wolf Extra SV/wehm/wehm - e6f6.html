			<P>This is a small but rather furious level.</P>
			<P>Fight off enemies coming at you from everywhere in the dreadful and confusing 
outdoor area. Locate the Silver Key in the north-eastern part, but watch out for 
the mutants outside the columns. Health and powerups are found in the main section 
as well as behind a secret door in the south-western corner. Find the Gold Key at 
the eastern end of the corridor in the north. The elevator is in the opposite end 
of the corridor. More powerups and a 1-up are found in the two rooms in the northern 
part. But the fighting continues.</P>
