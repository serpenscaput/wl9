			<P>Ghosts here?</P>
			<P>This is your first encounter with ghosts (knowing that episode 6 is to be played 
before episode 3).</P>
			<P>Get to the back of the central block to get the Silver Key. Don't stay too 
long in the first room, but prepare for more heavy battling in the first hallway. 
The western wall of the next hallway has a secret door that leads you to the Gold 
Key. If you want the 1-up in this section you have to confront yet another ghost 
and get past several SS. Make it past even more SS beyond the gold key doors on your 
way to the elevator. There are no machine guns to be picked up in this level either.</P>

			<P>A secret short cut in the southern section takes you straight to the elevator.</P>
