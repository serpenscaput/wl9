			<P>The alternating green and red ceiling lights emphasize the tivoli image of 
this level. By looking past the columns at the start you will see the elevator door. 
What you will not know is that you are seeing it from inside. What you are actually 
looking into is the elevator itself. In the whole history of Wolfenstein this must 
be the most luxurious elevator ever! A chandelier, dinner tables, green plants, armours 
, lots of treasure and more. It also includes a Grosse brother and a Fake Hitler. 
Make it to the dead end with the two SS in the north-western part for the secret 
door leading to the central area. You may manage to get to the elevator without a 
Gold Key, but it will be an advantage to possess it when the final action starts. 
Look for it in the north-eastern secret area or fight a Grosse in the south-western 
one. A chaingun is found in the secret area to the south-east, 1-ups are found in 
several places. But watch out for the ghosts, they follow you everywhere. Don't get 
surprised by the enemies in the silver key rooms towards the end, but try to get 
the powerups in these rooms. To get at the elevator control you must push a wall 
block.</P>
