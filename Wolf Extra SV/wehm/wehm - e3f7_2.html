			<P>But there is yet another path. At the end of the corridor to the right by the 
sign is a pushwall into another small corridor with a chaingun. Now, instead of pushing 
the sign... Push the outdoor area!!! This is the entrance to the Hero's Retreat (see 
the Bonus Level section in wolfxtra.txt). Take the 1-up. From here you also get to 
the second of the Silver Keys. But now you are also able to go south past the outdoor 
area on the outside of the columns. This path leads to the other entrance of the 
secret elevator. But you can still get further south. In the south-western corner 
fight a Grosse and several SS and officers. There is a 1-up nearby and lots of ammo, 
further on there is more health. After the last Dead Guard Trick of this level you 
open the door to the hidden room. Run past the SS and the officers a hateful shouting 
ringing in your ears. More SS and officers come in from the left and right ahead. 
Fight them all! A 1-up is at the far end. The firing machine monster is at your heels 
joined by SS and officers. Time for a countdown. More health and ammo are found in 
adjacent rooms and corridors. Plus another secret elevator.	<A HREF=e3f7.html>back</A></P>
