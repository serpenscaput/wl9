			<P>Don't spend too much ammo on the officers running to and fro behind the columns, 
some SS will come in from the next room. Grab some ammo then turn left and push two 
walls to get into a similar gallery this time on the outside of the columns. Shoot 
the SS behind them and push one of three walls to get a machine gun and some health. 
Don't push any of these walls outward. Now you have a machine gun you are ready for 
the action that follows. In the brown panel area things will develop quite differently 
depending on where you go. The little room with health and ammo can be a good place 
to stop by. Make it to the big grey stone room to get the chaingun behind a pushwall. 
You may get guards to open the gold key door for you, otherwise find the Gold Key 
past the SS in the north. Get the 1-up and enter the maze. Follow the crowns for 
the short cut, the chests for the long way. Once by the elevator, get the 1-up next 
to it. In the red brick area fight two Grosses for the Silver Key to get to the secret 
elevator in the south-western corner, past a third Grosse! Find lots of reinforcements 
in two secret rooms.</P>
