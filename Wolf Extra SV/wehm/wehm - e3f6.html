			<P>A symmetrical castle floor. However the positioning of the doors makes this 
level a confusing maze of rooms. The enemies get alarmed at unsuspecting moments 
and move in from unknown areas. So be on your guard. Move into the northern hallway, 
from the second room go south, then turn east. Engage in a heavy fight in the last 
two rooms before the central hallway (there is health in a secret room nearby), and 
in even more after you enter the hallway. The Silver Key is at the end of a corridor 
on the west side. The Gold Key is behind the third door on your left in the big room. 
Fight desperately to keep off all the enemies that come at you from all of the rooms. 
Make it back into the hallway. Here more enemies are pouring out from adjacent rooms. 
Stop by a secret room with a 1-up on your way to the gold key door at the west end. 
Fight your way through this path to the elevator. Behind several pushwalls in the 
western area you find lots of treasure and powerups. Open a prison door in the south-western 
corner and get ready for a chaingun. And for a deadly confrontation! Find a 1-up 
beyond the room with a second Gold Key.</P>
