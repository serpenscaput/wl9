			<P>This may be the toughest level opening in this episode. Jump at the machine 
gun and fight it out.</P>
			<P>Push the walls by the wooden barrels in the south-eastern corner to get into 
the confusing vine section. The Gold Key is hidden inside it, but the mutants are 
everywhere.<BR>
			Make it to the central room to get the Silver Key, then head on towards the north-east 
and reenter the vine section. Soon you will locate the elevator.</P>
			<P>There are two 1-ups to be found.</P>
