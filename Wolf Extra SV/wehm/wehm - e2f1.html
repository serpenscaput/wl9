			<P>This is one gloomy and cold opening to a gloomy and cold episode.</P>
			<P>When entering the main hallway, locate the health powerups if you want to stay 
alive fighting the mutants.<BR>
			There is a machine gun behind a well at the far end of the hallway. Push the wall 
beside it.<BR>
			The Gold Key is found in the major block behind another pushwall.<BR>
			If you get into the secret room with columns you will see what you will think 
is the elevator to the secret level. But how to get to it?<BR>
			The trick is that what appears to be the ordinary elevator is a pushwall. The 
elevator you have seen is the one that leads to floor 2.<BR>
			To get to the secret floor you have to be involved in even more heavy fighting 
with both mutants and SS past a pushwall north of the elevator.<BR>
			Finally you find yourself in the north-western corner of the floor. Push the nearby 
wall to get the chaingun and the 1-up, and go through another dummy elevator. On 
your way to the secret elevator you may fight it out with a Grosse brother.</P>
