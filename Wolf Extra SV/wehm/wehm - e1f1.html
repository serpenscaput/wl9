enter the main hallway.</P>
			<P> Make it past the SS behind the green barrels then head on towards the elevator.<BR>

			You won't get a machine gun though unless you move around towards the elevator 
to the secret level, past the silver key door and a secret door.
			If you do don't forget to fetch the chaingun and the 1-up as well before moving 
up to the secret floor.</P>
