Here's the first two levels of my add-on for Spear Of Destiny.  UnZIP them
into the same directory as your Spear Of Destiny game, then run the file
RMK-SOD.EXE.  It should install the levels and graphics for you.  You can set
the game to run the original levels again by entering RMK-SOD once again.

I kindly thank AReyeP and MCS for inspiring these levels with their "Spear:
Resurrection" add-on.

Note: There was a bug in the SOD's original Level 4 that I have now fixed.  I
also modified several objects to use graphics from the original Wolfenstein
game;  several "Angel Of Death" objects will appear as stoves and beds when
you play the Angel Of Death part of Level 18 (a.k.a. Level 21).  Two piles of
debris will also appear either as kitchen utensils or as pots and pans.
