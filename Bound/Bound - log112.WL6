^C7d Pushable Objects

^C00 The player can push the barrel and the oil drum. This can be done to prevent 
a guard from entering an area or to block pathways. To push a barrel or a drum, press 
space when standing next to it, facing the direction you want to push towards. A 
wall or another object will stop them.

One push = one space forward.
