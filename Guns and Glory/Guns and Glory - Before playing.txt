Please, before playing the game read the Readthis.
The games mechanics have been modified from that of the original Wolfenstein
and may come as quite a shock for the unprepaired.

Also if you wish to listen to the games adlib sounds and music please download 
and install this program: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdmsound/

Right click wolfenstein and select run with VDMS, and it should work from there.


If you have any questions please email me at Dakteam@aol.com, or visit me at the 

Diehard wolfers Forum, or at my deviantart site http://tiny-brain.deviantart.com/


Thanks for downloading Guns and Glory now go Play!

PS. on a side note, since the beginning of this game, i've started posting 
news of my projects elsewhere, so check out my new local at deviantart.com,
and if you want browse my gallery, It isn't comprised entirely of Wolfenstein,
but it does have lots of other things that may peek your interest.
