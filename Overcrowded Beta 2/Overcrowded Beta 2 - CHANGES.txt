- Poison Damage should no longer carry over between levels
- You can now prestige at any time you fulfill requirements, except on Floor 1. Formerly 
restricted to the first 15 seconds of a level.
- Prestige notification is now a bit more noticable.
- Prestige has been rebalanced to account for being able to level whenever (increases 
for early rewards, decreases/stable for higher). May be tweaked further.
