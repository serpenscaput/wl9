^C[Red]The Story

^C00Gerald is a good dog.  He spends his days chewing on his bone and chasing squirrels without a care in the world.
Then THEY came. It started with just one.  Just one stinky minion of evil.  It decided it wanted to stay.
^P
^C[Red]The Story

^C00Now, there's THOUSANDS of those bastards, killing Gerald's birds and digging up his spot, and being a general pain in the ass!
Gerald runs to his human to find the horrible truth.....the humans have been turned into hideous cat-people!  Oh no!
Now it's up to Gerald to tear up these cats and find out what turned the humans into these things!

^C[Red]ABOUT ^C[Green]ASTROCREEP

^C00I've been making mods for Wolfenstein 3D off and on
since around 1996.  After a long hiatus, I discovered
ECWolf, and have been making mods for it ever since.

^C00Aside from modding Wolf, I also enjoy making music and
editing/creating images in Photoshop.  My GFX work is
mostly done in these games, but you can check out my music
