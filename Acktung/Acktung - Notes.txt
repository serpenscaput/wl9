acktung!

Greetings.

What you have downloaded is the full 60-level compilation of my little add-on.  This 
includes the original missions (1-30), of which the first 20 are classic maps dating 
from the early 1990's to now and the 10 levels that I contributed to the DHW contest 
earlier this year (2003).

The last 30 levels, aka the Nocturnal Missions, are all brand new levels created 
over the past few months.  I thought about tossing in some old levels to save time, 
but some how I got on a roll and POOF... the nocturnal missions were born.  Enjoy.


There is no rhyme or reason to the level selection, but they are placed, for the 
most part, to get more difficult as you progress through each episode.  If they don't, 
it's for a reason  ;)  Par times are out of whack too.  I wanted this game to be 
pure wolf... no code/graphic/sound changes whatsoever.

These levels should be bug-free, but if you see anything out of whack, drop me a 
note (ack (at) ifnetork.com) or post something at DHW and I will get back to you.

I seem to use the work 'whack' too much  :o

Although I am not proud to admit this, if you want to see some of my other work you 
can always check out Halls of Stonehenge (I did 16 of the maps).

Let's ackknowledge some people...

- Brian/Schabbs for keeping the fire burning (love both the web sites!)
- The Choksta for putting up with my endless stream of questions and mostly for being 
a friend.
- Ariel for the constant input, which has only made me a better mapper, and of course 
for being my friend
- Barbara for being my #1 fan and for the encouragement she has always given (and 
she's a heck of a lot cuter than Brian, Chris or Ariel - lol).
- id software... I hope you guys spent my money well  ;)
- Bill Kirby cuz some of us still use the old editors  :)


Okay - that's it... now go whack (I mean blast) some Nazis  ;)
