you the next version of levels when available.  I will also customize 
(registered people only) for those who wish just write me a note! 
The file REGISTER.DOC provides a form to use for placing your order.

Even if you do not wish to register I would like to hear from you.  Comments
suggestions??  Were the levels to hard/easy... Not enough "goodies"?
I will start on a second ext if enough interest is generated.

FILES INCLUDED:

INSTALL.EXE
NUMBER.DAT
README.DOC
REGISTER.DOC
MAPTEMP.SAV
MAPHEAD.SAV
ZCOPY03.DOC
ZCOPY03.EXE

INSTALLATION

The provided install.exe makes it easy for you to use your new levels.
You can execute the install.exe from either floppy or hard disk provided
that the MAPTEMP.SAV and MAPHEAD.SAV files are in your Castle Wolfenstein
(shareware version) directory.  

First a menu selection will appear press either 1 or 2 depending on what 
selection you desire. Then you will need to tell it what directory your
Wolfenstein game is in.  

        EXAMPLE:
                C:\GAMES\WOLF

Then presto! The install program will rename the original level files with 
extension .SAV and copy the new ones to .wl1.  

To manually change the files back to the original or vice versa simply rename
the replacement (or original) files with a different extension, and rename
the original files back to *.wl1
                           
        EXAMPLE:  If you want to change the original to the new level.            
                
                RENAME MAP*.WL1 MAP*.TMP
                RENAME MAP*.SAV MAP*.WL1
                        

                  If you want to change it back!

                RENAME MAP*.WL1 MAP*.SAV
                RENAME MAP*.TMP MAP*.WL1

I hope you enjoy these new worlds and will consider registering to
support further advanced in affordable software!
