^C7eHOUSE OF VANILLA
^C00
This floor has been completly dominated by demonic entities. They are too dangerous now, even for nazis. So, as a precaution, a gas have been liberated on the whole place. It has slow effects, but you'll have to keep an eye on your health everytime. 
As this is also dangerous for anyone, you are only allowed to leave the place after you defeat a good ammount of them. Good luck.
