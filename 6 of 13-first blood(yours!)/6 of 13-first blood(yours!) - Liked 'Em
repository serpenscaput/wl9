From:  HACKER782<<I am also sending the first 4 levels of the second part. I am stumped and don't know what to do for the last three. can you give me some original ideas? I appreciate your reading this, even if you don't download the levels.>>I played your levels and I liked them! They are action packed, not boring like some of the levels on AOL are.But, boy, someone said MY levels were hard! Floor two was a real toughie, but I was able to win without cheating. Took me a few tries, though! On floor 5 I got a lot of invisible enemies, but that added kind of a challenge in itself. I wasn't able to beat that one without cheating, but I just used the "all weapons" cheat, not the "invulnerability" cheat (the bazooka and flame thrower are the only weapons that will work against invisible enemies). I liked that level, because I like the ones where the enemies come after YOU, instead of you just going after them.My advice for your last levels would be this: create a lot of rooms that are next to each other. Like this: (asterisks (*) represent the rooms)* * * * * * ** * * * * * ** * * * * * ** * * * * * *The rooms can be different sizes, of course. Put a few enemies  in each room. Maybe a boss or two on the whole level. Then just start randomly removing doors here and there. The enemies "come after" you when they can "hear" you, and removing doors allows this. Then play your game. You'll be surprised what happens! Then put those doors back and remove other ones. The game will probably play completely different! Experiment til you find the action you like best.Good luck!P.S. The way I created my levels was by looking at other people's levels and saying "How could this be better" or "This was pretty good, but it would be cooler if it was like ...." Then I created my own level based on that level, only better.Cy
