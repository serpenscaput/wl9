You run out of the tower and hook up with the Underground.  They inform you that 
the rumors were true: some hideous human experiments were seen around yet another 
Trump Tower. So Operation Eisenhaar is real!

You must journey there and terminate the maniacal Dr. Trump before his undead army 
marches against humanity!

And in episode three, the real Trump hides in his titanic bunker as the GOP crumbles 
about him.  It is your job to intercept him, scattering racists everywhere.

And if you like Trump Tower 3D, you'll love the other three episodes!  Thirty more 
action-packed, super- challenging levels!  And two of the bosses aren't Trump!
