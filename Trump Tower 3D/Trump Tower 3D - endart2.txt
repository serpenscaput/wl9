You stand over Trump' fat, evil, swollen putrid hair piece, glad your mission is 
finally over.  All his journals and equipment will be destroyed.  Humanity is safe 
from his hordes of hideous mutants.

Yet the KKK-sensitive atrocities continue: thousands are deported even as the GOP 
hate machine falls to its knees.  There is only one way to stop the madness. . .

^c00
In episode three, MechaTrump hides in his titanic bunker as the GOP crumbles about 
him.  It is your job to intercept him, ending his mad reign.  You find he has escaped 
to a Klan mansion, and there you must confront him.

And if you like Trump Tower 3D, you'll love the other three episodes!  Thirty more 
action-packed, super- challenging levels!  And two of the bosses aren't Trump!
