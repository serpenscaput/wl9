^c00This is the epic story of B.J. Blazkowicz, American spy for the Allied forces 
in the 2016 election.  Facing horrific dangers, sometimes he only had a knife and 
his wits between him and death.  His escape from Trump Tower is the stuff of contemporary 
legend.

^G16,16,4
^c00Herein are the tales of our hero and his nighttime assault on the wagers of a 
racist war: his assignment to intercept Sarah Palin, the cheerleader of ignorance; 
his elimination of the neonazi clones of Donald Trump; and his final battle against 
the bully who had given in to the hatred, Chris Christie.  This is the tale of how 
B.J. Blazkowicz became a symbol of freedom and justice, how he stood against untold 
odds and dealt the enemy a crippling blow.
^PAGE 5
Captain William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, you've got a gun and a deadly mission ahead. 
Good luck!

Hey, if you make it, you'll have something to tell your grandkids about . . . .

If you don't, at least you'll go out in a blaze of glory!

^c7eCONTROLS
^c00
In Trump Tower 3-D, you can use the keyboard, mouse, joystick, or Gravis PC Gamepad.

 
To move around the menus, use the arrow keys to move from item to item, then press 
^c6eEnter ^c00to select that item.  ^c6eEsc ^c00always backs out.  You can press 
the first letter of a menu item to go to that item.

Or use the mouse, joystick, or Gamepad-- they work, too!
^PAGE 7
^G20,16,5
Once you are in the game, use the arrow keys to move. Hold down ^c6eShift ^c00to 
run fast.

Press ^c6eCtrl ^c00to fire your weapon.

Use ^c6eAlt ^c00 with the left and right arrows to slide side to side instead of 
turning left or right.  This is called "Strafe Mode."

Press ^c6eSpace ^c00to Open Doors and activate elevators to go to the next floor 
of the tower.
^PAGE 8
^G16,16,6
When using the mouse or joystick, use button 1 to shoot, button 2 to strafe.



With a three-button mouse, use the third button to open doors.

Gravis PC Gamepads have a fourth button, useful as a run button.

Some walls in the building can be pushed back to reveal hidden rooms. Hold down Space 
to push the wall in front of you. Just think of Space as the Use key. It will use 
doors, use elevators, and so on.

There are locked doors in the castle that require either a gold or silver key.  It 
will be somewhere on the floor you're on.

If you find your health dropping, pick up some food or first aid.  You'll find you're 
damaged more when shot at close range.

^G16,16,9
Pick up the ammo left behind when you toast someone.  For instance, perforate an 
SS--free machine gun!


You get a free guy every 40,000 points, so collect those treasures! (You can have 
a maximum of nine lives.)

When you get killed, you lose everything but your pistol and start at the beginning 
of the floor you were on.
