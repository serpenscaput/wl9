The absolute incarnation of evil, Donald Trump, lies at your feet in a puddle of 
what we're going to call ketchup.  His wrinkled, crimson- splattered visage still 
puckers, insane even in defeat.  Your lips pinched in bitter victory, you kick his 
hairpiece off and spit on his suit.

Make America great again?  Maybe now it stands a chance. . .
