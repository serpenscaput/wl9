Wolfenstein
The Secret Missions:part 01-A new objective

Classified information (Story)**************************************************************


In the year of 1948,world war II was long and gone but the Nazis weren't,and our 
young WWII
hero (Captain Blazkowicz) had been fighting them for 6 years now.He was tired of 
fighting 
the Nazis and was tired of the sight of dead bodies,he wanted out of the military.One 
day he
had got a new order,it read:

TO-CAPTAIN WILLIAM JOSEPH (B.J.) BLAZKOWICZ
FROM-THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS

 These will be your last orders if you accomplish this mission.You are to infiltrate 
a 
mountain fortress on the Austrian/German border and eliminate the Nazi generals that 
occupy 
this fortress.We will not lie to you,many other Allied soldiers have attempted this 
but have
have lost their lives in the line of duty,because of this,the Nazis have named this 
place 
"Death's Palace." Let's hope you won't be another victim of this fortress.

END OF MISSION ORDERS

 You have heard tales of this place being unbeatable because of the number of Nazi 
soldiers 
within the fortress,you have a feeling in your gut saying you can't walk out this 
place
alive.You climb up the side of the mountain until you found a path leading into some 
mossy 
covered rooms carved straight into the mountain.Whether you complete this mission 
or die 
trying,it will of course be your last mission,and with that in mind,you unsheath 
your knife.
