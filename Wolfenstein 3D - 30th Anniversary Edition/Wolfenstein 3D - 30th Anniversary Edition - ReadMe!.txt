= = Wolfenstein 3D - 30th Anniversary Edition = =

On 1992,May 05, the first shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D was released. Now, the game that formed an entire game genre, that still (mostly) holds up, just turned 30 years old, thanks to the community, the modders, and the players for keeping this game alive, hopefully for decades to come.

Let's celebrate this event with a mod release for both DOS and SDL -- Wolfenstein 3D - 30th Anniversary Edition -- an unofficial mod that features an exclusive new trilogy set through three episodes, 10 levels each. Featuring two new guns and items you haven't seen before in the original game, they will help you on your journey through dangerous caves, dark torture chambers, even appear in Castle Wolfenstein, that's right! Such release must include the original levels too, however, they are locked by default, pick the "Read This!" option to know how to unlock them! Also featuring some quality of life improvements and engine enhancements, bringing back features that never made it into the original game, such as the automap! But hey, now! Let's not spoil all the fun, shall we? Let's explore the rest all by yourself!

And now, time to credit all the people who put effort and helped me, so this project can see the daylight! Honestly, I felt like crediting people here instead of messing up the game's read this option with all of this.
