Thank you for downloading WOLF OVERDRIVE, my 20th mod. The levels were put together 
between June and December, 2015 using MapEdit 8.4.

Andy Nonymous did the coding back in early 2015, which I am very thankful for. I 
had to reconsider how to approach this particular mod after making one, kind of uninteresting 
level when I first received the EXE. Come June, I felt full of ideas and just went 
from there. The level was however playable and eventually surfaced as the opening 
level in the DieHardWolfers' Lost Episodes map set.

Notable features of this mod include:

* 48 seamless BRAND NEW levels - 40 regular levels, 8 secret (including 2 super secret)

* Music from SPEAR OF DESTINY
* Weird, wild new ceiling colors
* The knife is a silent weapon
* Ammo box from SPEAR OF DESTINY
* 20+ new sprites from SPEAR OF DESTINY and others
* 4 keys
* Ammo goes to 200
* 3-D directional sprites

I have always been a classic Wolf fan at heart and find it most fun making mods in 
this fashion.

There is no story line as such, but there's a re-cast of your old pals:

* General Fettgesicht
* Barnacle Wilhelm
* Doctor Schabbs
* Adolf Hitler
* The Death Knight

... And introducing the one and only Hans Grosse!

Almost 25 years on I am happy to see how popular id Software's WOLFENSTEIN 3D and 
SPEAR OF DESTINY still are. A lot of my work is based on making levels - everything 
besides that is pretty much the old, original games.

Using Merthsoft's re-coloring tool I took the liberty of changing a few graphics 
here and there. A handful of the other non-original walls originally come from one 
of Ken O'Brien's wall pack sets and his excellent 2003 set, Remake. A small amount 
of sprites were also taken from Formgen's Spear Mission Packs (aka The Lost Episodes).


If you experience any level bugs, feel free to contact me at thomas_weiling@hotmail.com 
- any time.

I hope you enjoy playing this mod as much as I enjoyed making it! :-)
