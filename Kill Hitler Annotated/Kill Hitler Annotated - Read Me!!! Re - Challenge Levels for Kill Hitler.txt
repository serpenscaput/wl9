Included in this folder are several of the
secret levels, final levels, and challenging
scenarios in Kyle's Kill Hitler Wolfenstein 3D
addon. 

Level 9 of Episode 6 is extremely difficult
at the I am Death Incarnate level. You will
need EVERY bullet to complete this level 
with an All-Kill. I ran out of bullets, but  I
was fortunate to be able to kill Hitler with
my knife!

Save ammo by using the pistolat times. 
The knife may be a good option at times
as well.

In levels 8 & 9 of Episode 6, there are
places where you can become trapped
by moving a hidden wall. Get your keys
first before you explore for secrets &
treasures in ENCLOSED ROOMS. Save 
frequently when looking for secrets on
those floors.

One such trap, in Level 9, will lead you to 
the final battle zone. 

Good Luck,B.J.
