         Thank you for Downloading the METEO addon pack


This addon contains the same amount of levels as the original and I tried to make 
it as fun as possible.

I hope you enjoy METEO addon.  Please forgive me on one small error I have.  Level 
1 of Episode 2 has the wrong ceiling color and I did not have the code to change 
it. But the level is still fun and playable.

Thank you.  

Please Enjoy the game. Johnathan.
