Text file accompanying the add-on Wolf-Extra II: the NIGHTMARE.



Thank you for wanting to play my add-on Wolf-Extra II: the NIGHTMARE.

Wolf-Extra II has been created by using MapEdit by David Huntoon, Bryan Baker and 
Warren Buss,
and WolfEdit by Bill Kirby for some changes to the graphics file.

You will need the full version of Spear of Destiny by id Software to play this add-on.

Wolf-Extra II consists of 5 levels.

How to install Wolf-Extra II.
In a directory where you have the Spear game, replace four of the files with those 
included in Wolf-Extra II.
IMPORTANT. Remember to keep back-ups of the original game files.

Please notice!
The "Death Incarnate" difficulty level in my set is designed to be as difficult as 
possible without being impossible!
All levels have been tested on "Death Incarnate" starting with only a pistol and 
8 shots.


Wolf-Extra II release notes.

Wolf-Extra II v2.55.

This version includes a new Spear.exe.

Wolf-Extra II is freeware and may only be distributed free of charge.
All five files must be included, and no other.

The author of Wolf-Extra II kindly requests people not to modify Wolf-Extra II nor 
use part of it in other add-ons.




The Story.

Adolf Hitler is dead. It is over.

But it is not! The terrible spirit of Evil will haunt you forever.

Trapped in the dungeons of you own mind. You can never escape.

But there is a way.

Capture the Spear and crush the Fiend to put an end to: the NIGHTMARE.




Paal Olstad.
