			<P>Once you have the silver key you may move back to the opening area. A secret 
room past a pushwall and a silver key door holds a third 1-up, and two Grosses! To 
fight them have them follow you into some other sections, run back to the room they 
were in and get past another pushwall to get to the ammo behind the barrels near 
the start.</P>
			<P>Eventually you enter the central area beyond a Dead Guard Trick. Here you will 
find the elevator, but you will also confront Barnacle Wilhelm. Fight him at close 
range while running around the short central wall. Look out for any remaining enemies 
in this room as well as any possible stray ones outside the barrels.	<A HREF=f3_3.html>back</A></P>
