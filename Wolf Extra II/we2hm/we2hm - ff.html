			<P>Go left or right.<BR>
			Either way prepare to fight for your life in this creepy mutant and ghost infested 
area.<BR>
			In the south three Ubermutants await.</P>
			<P>The silver key is found in the little room at the south end (together with 
one of the Ubermutants). You must defeat one of the Ubermutants to get the gold key. 
Locate the 1-ups found in each of the two secret rooms, one in the western part and 
one in the eastern part. Ammo and health are found in niches and locked rooms.</P>

			<P>Having acquired both keys you start exploring the central section. And move 
in for the final battle....</P>
			<P>When getting low on health and ammo find your way back to the outer sections 
for reinforcements, but look out for ghosts, roaming mutants and Ubermutants.</P>

			<P>If you start on a new life, there is a chaingun behind you.</P>
