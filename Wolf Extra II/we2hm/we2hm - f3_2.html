			<P>With or without a chaingun you will have to get a gold key to get past the 
door beyond the pushwall by the armours in the big hallway in the northern section. 
Fight a Grosse cousin in the northeastern corner or one of the Ubermutants down south 
to get one. To get the 1-up in the room in the northeast you must have a gold key 
too. If you have shot the first moving mutant choose a route west by south and follow 
this path to the north. There is a set of pushwalls by the spear racks. But beware 
yet another Ubermutant.</P>
			<P>Then continue into the northwestern parts. Have the SS behind the brown columns 
open a locked door to get to another 1-up. To get past the door into the green moss 
section you must have alarmed the mutants behind the cages to come around and open 
it for you. However, if you have shot them all, it still possible to get further 
on past a set of pushwalls a little to the south. If you want the ammo by the SS 
behind the barrels you must shoot them in positions where they don't block the swastika 
pushwall.	<A HREF=f3_3.html>next page</A>	<A HREF=f3.html>back</A></P>
