			<P>There is a chaingun hidden in this level and there are two ways of getting 
at it.</P>
			<P>To get it the fast way you must do as follows. Open the first door, then turn 
to the left. You will see a mutant entering a locked door. Shoot him in the doorway 
but beware the mutants behind the barrels to the north. Run through the now opened 
door, turn right and go through the next door. You will then see a second mutant 
entering another locked door. Don't shoot him but move up to the columns in time 
to see a third mutant opening yet another locked door. Shoot him in this doorway 
and wait for the second mutant to come at you. Shoot him to get past the second locked 
door and move over to the third one.</P>
			<P>There's a pushwall behind it. Remove this and follow the path to the left and 
the chaingun is yours.	<A HREF=f3_2.html>next page</A></P>
