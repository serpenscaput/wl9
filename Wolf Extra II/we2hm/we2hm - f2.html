			<P>You may come to a quick ending at the start of this level. Rush forward and 
into one of the side corridors for some ammo and health. If you get a chance to turn 
around there may be nobody there, just a skeleton blocking the cold outside area.</P>

			<P>Start by cleaning out the first mutant infested area. After that you have three 
choices of moving. The northeastern and southern sections have secret rooms with 
goods that it can be wise to pick up before entering the main central section. Take 
care to clear the southern section, you may need to enter this from the central section 
later.</P>
			<P>Now move into the central part. Fight your way through the first rooms and.... 
get confronted by a Grosse! And you only have a pistol!!<BR>
			One of the rooms you passed held enemies that are now following you, one of them 
is an SS. Drop him to get a machine gun (other SS may come in from some hidden rooms 
too), or better yet find the secret room with the 1-up and an SS and get his machine 
gun.	<A HREF=f2_2.html>next page</A></P>
