			<P>Pick up the ammo and the machine gun by the locked door. If you start this 
level with only a little ammo (i.e. 8 shots) don't waste anything on the enemies 
behind the columns (you may handle them later). For a chaingun move into the northeastern 
section and get involved in some heavy action to acquire one. Then run back past 
the columns and enter the northwestern section. A Dead Guard Trick blocks the passage 
back. Fight the enemies in this section then enter the room with the prison cell. 
Push this secret door. Now you enter the big blue stone area with a lot of similar 
looking corridors. Start exploring this area. Be prepared for surprises. But be very 
careful not to waste too much ammo, there is not much to be picked up. Try to locate 
the extra ammo that exist. Over in the eastern part there are two movable wall blocks 
both situated by green barrels. The southern one lets you get into a small part of 
the central area, here you find a lot of ammo. The other one is a Dead Guard Trick, 
beyond it you enter further into the central parts. But locate first the prison cell 
in the northeast, a 1-up is found inside it.	<A HREF=f4_2.html>next page</A></P>
