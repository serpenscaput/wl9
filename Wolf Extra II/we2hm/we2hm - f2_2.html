			<P>There is no chaingun to be found in this level. The room with the Grosse holds 
two SS as well. Finish with them and fight off Grosse. You may run out of ammo, make 
it into the big hallway past Grosse and get involved in more heavy action. The big 
red brick room holds a lot of ammo plus health, 4 SS and an Ubermutant! Now things 
get rather tough. The blue section is heavily infested. Try to make it into the southern 
section by the silver key, but look out for enemies coming out of adjoining rooms 
through locked doors. These rooms hold goods. One room holds a 1-up but this one 
requires a gold key and the enemies here may not open the door. Locate the silver 
key door at the southern end of the long winding central corridor. This leads to 
more rooms with goods, but now enemies are pouring in from everywhere.</P>
			<P>You need to finish with one of the super guards to get past the gold key door 
up northwest. Here you find the elevator. Prepare for more fighting with the enemies 
in adjoining rooms and in the elevator itself.	<A HREF=f2.html>back</A></P>
