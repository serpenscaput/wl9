			<P>Now you enter the central section. Eliminate the two mutants and pick up some 
more goods if you need it (this may be fetched later). Beyond another Dead Guard 
Trick you find even more. Near by is a secret door that you may get through from 
the other side. Enter the door to the central block, a last Dead Guard Trick blocks 
the retreat. Move through the next door and get ready for a countdown with the Death 
Knight and a whole lot of officers and SS. Keep moving, pick up health and ammo while 
finishing with the officers and SS, and fighting off the Death Knight. Locate the 
secret doors. A silver key is in the central niche, this lets you out into the northern 
passage. Defeat the Death Knight and get the gold key. Two more silver key doors 
leads to the opening section. If you get stuck in between the silver key doors with 
the Death Knight at your heels and move up here watch out for the guards behind the 
columns, the purple brick areas will now be blocked off. The Death Knight at last 
defeated try to finish with these guards as well. Then you enter the gold key door 
behind the entry elevator for the Spear.	<A HREF=f4.html>back</A></P>
