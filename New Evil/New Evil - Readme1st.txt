                          A new updated "Evil In Iron"
  

        


    ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS SINCE B.J. RECOVERED THE SPEAR FROM THE EVIL DEATHKNIGHT.
YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THE ALLIED CORPS FIELD OFFICE IN  FRANCE FOR 
A MEETING WITH THE ALLIED HIGH COMMAND.. RUMORS HAVE CIRCULATED FOR
MONTHS CONCERNING A "SUPER" ARMOUR THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE NAZIS.
A PERSON WEARING THIS ARMOUR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND AN ATTACK BY 
VIRTUALLY ANY TYPE OF WEAPON.....YOU MUST GO TO GERMANY AND STEAL THE PLANS FOR
THE ARMOUR AND DESTROY THE 1 EXAMPLE IN EXISTENCE BEFORE HITLER CAN PUT IT INTO 

PRODUCTION!  GO NOW TO GERMANY, AND ON TO CASTLE HEINMAKKER, AND FACE THE 
DANGERS YOU KNOW TOO WELL....ANOTHER DAMP, DARK, STINKY CASTLE, FILLED WITH
MURDERING NAZI FILTH......WAITING FOR YOU.

     THIS IS A NEW UPDATED VERSION OF MY OLD SET "EVIL IN IRON". OVER THE
LAST FEW MONTHS, I HAVE RECIEVED MANY REQUESTS TO DO A SEQUEL TO IT. SINCE IT WAS 
PART OF A
MULTI-EPISODE SET, I DECIDED TO DO AN UPDATED VERSION WITH MORE LEVELS, A FEW NEW 
GRAPHICS,
AND SOME SOURCE CODE CHANGES, AND A LOT OF NEW SOUNDS. THE MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED 
AROUND,
 THE CIELING COLORS CHANGED, AND SOME NEW GRAPHICS ADDED FROM SPEAR OF DESTINY ALONG 
WITH THE
REMOVAL OF THE EPISODE STUCTURE FOR THE 21 LEVELS. THE FIRST 9 LEVELS ARE FROM THE 
OLD SET 
AND THE REMAINING 12 ARE NEW, ALONG WITH A NEW ENDING LEVEL.

THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE HAVE HELPED AND CONTRIBUTED TO THIS SET:

Ian Quinn (Quinnsey).....The cool Chainlink fence
Tristan Van Putten........The grey uniformed SS
Ken O'Brien..............Some walls and the map for level 11(with my graphics mods)

Paul Gibson..............Level 5 (from the first Evil in Iron)
Brian Lowe...............Level 15 (From the excellent WolfBel2)
Randall Penn.............The idea for Level 19
Sam Chiang...............for calling me the Wolfenstein "GOD"
Harry "DA MUNCHER" Sr....for some sounds, the restroom facilities, and his help
with the EXE, and for his fiendship these last 2 years.

And most of all, to my sweet CHERI,(Lakota)who tolerates her old man's WOLF habit!

And to Precious, and Rusty, my faithful K-9 companions...

Comments or Complaints..................john_bucksnort@yahoo.com
I always welcome comments...I have a special place for complaints...LOL

This is a very difficult set...be patient,  the solutions to getting out
 of one of my levels can always be found...often in plain sight...Enjoy!
All of these levels are beatable on Death Incarnate without cheating!
