^C7cThe Secret Level Problem: ^C00
So, I decided to add a secret weapon exclusive to the secret level.
This weapon is too powerful and would make the game too easy if the player
were to have it during a playthrough.
Now I have no idea how to take away the players weapons at the beginning of a level.
Let me be clear! The player is only supposed to use this secret weapon
while playing the secret level, ^C[Dark Red]NO OTHER WEAPONS.
^P^
^C00So there are some requests that I have, if you manage to find the secret level.
Since this weapon is only meant for the secret level, I would
appreciate it if you emptied all of the ammo before proceeding.
And like I said in the last page, ^C[Dark Red]DO NOT ^C00use any other weapon while
playing the secret level. By the way the secret exit is in map 3, not 1.
^P^
Hopefully I made that clear. Now that all of that stuff is out of the way.
Im actually not sure what else to write here. I suppose all of the other info
will be in the description. OK, now go kick some nazi ass!
Oh yeah, and enjoy!
