SamWolf Demo version 2


NEW FEATURES

changed chaingun to "Burst Rifle"
200 ammo
new music (plus originals by me)
"heartbeat" sound
new weapons
new Hans Grosse (just a quick sprite, since I wasn't too interested
in spending a hell of a lot of time on this project.)
new episode (which makes 2/6 completed)

ALSO INCLUDED

my "WolfMusic" archive, which features various midis and their IMF
counterparts.  IMFCreator was used to make these, and Anvil Studio
was used for the songs by me.
