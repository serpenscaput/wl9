FRAGGERSTEIN 2 DEMO 

README


this is a demo i will have the story of the game written out in the full versionthere 
are about two complete episodes and on the third just the first beggining level cuz ites 
under construction if you have troubles with level two on e1m2 well heres a helpful hint 
there is a push wall hidden somewhere that reveales a room with a map of the whole level
so you could use that as a helpful guide or be like an albino blacksheep and just keep going 
until you find the key or both gold keys in the maze until you reach the out side of maze and 
then you can acces and enter the locked door i for one pericularly hate tedios and boring 
mazes that some people like too do and think ites cool and is a good idea i dont think so 
stupid makes your game pretty impossible too beat without cheating some people dont playtest 
their levels without using cheats some dont evan play test them at all!! but i on the other 
hand made my levels possible too complete and i playtested them plenty and i could beat my 
really big maze!! so it proves it is possible too complete the demo game and the full game 
of fraggerstein 2 cuz i like my levels sometimes too be challenging and not boring or impossible
i like my levels if you have any suggestions or evan any comments questions or qurries then email 
me at topfragger@hotmail.com so enjoy the game demo have fun!!


ENJOY!!
