FRAGGERSTEIN 2 DEMO 

README


This is a demo. I will have the story of the game written out in the full version. 
There are about two complete episodes and on the third just the first beginning level 
cuz it's under construction. 

If you have troubles with level two on e1m2 well here's a helpful hint: there is 
a push wall hidden somewhere that reveals a room with a map of the whole level. You 
could use that as a helpful guide or be like an albino blacksheep and just keep going 
until you find the key or both gold keys in the maze. When you reach the outside 
of the maze, you can then access and enter the locked door. 

I for one particularly hate tedious and boring mazes that some people like to do. 
I think some mazes are cool and a good idea but I don't think it's so good to make 
your game pretty impossible to beat without cheating.
 
Some people dont playtest their levels without using cheats and some dont even play 
test them at all!! But I on the other hand made my levels possible to beat and I 
playtested them plenty. 

I could beat my really big maze!! So it proves it is possible to complete the demo 
game and the full game of Fraggerstein 2 cuz I like my levels sometimes to be challenging, 
not boring or impossible.

I like my levels - if you have any suggestions, or even any comments, questions or 
queries then email me at topfragger (at) hotmail.com. Enjoy the game demo - have fun!!



ENJOY!!
