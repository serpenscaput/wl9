WOLFENSTEIN 3D: CLAW OF EISENFAUST
Port of SNES Wolfenstein to ECWolf

v2 5/17/19

This is a port of the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D to
ECWolf.  This uses Executor's Second Encounter port as a
base, and then adds assets directly imported from the SNES
version of Wolfenstein. All sprites, sounds and textures
have been replaced with SNES counterparts, censorship and 
all.  Save the free world from Staatmeister and his Master
State!

VERSION 2
This version has been completely rebuilt, based off of
the actual extracted SNES maps and ec_snes/ec_macwolf.

VERSION 3
This version has a few XLAT/Decorate fixes, and also
has a completely reconstructed SNES status bar
(Lives counter is slightly different due to engine
limitations on HUD editing at the present time.)

CREDITS:
Assets ripped and modified from SNES Rom by AstroCreep (thanks to
Adam Biser for his SNES ripping tool)
