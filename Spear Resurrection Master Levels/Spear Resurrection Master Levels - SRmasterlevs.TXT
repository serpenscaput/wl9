SPEAR RESURRECTION MASTER LEVELS

Hello, Ian Summerfield here with my latest creation called: "Spear Resurrection Master 
Levels".

I made this add-on as a challenge game for people who loved the Great Spear Resurrection 
game. this mapdata pack replaces the first 5 levels in either Spear Resurrection 
or my earlier project Southern Hell. The supplied map files, i.e. GAMEMAPS.RIP and 
MAPHEAD.RIP are compatible with Spear Resurrection map files. Enjoy.

PS this game is a tribute to Areyep and MCS for their great add-ons.
