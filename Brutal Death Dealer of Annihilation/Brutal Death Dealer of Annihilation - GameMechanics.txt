-----------------Gameplay-----------------

Unlike in Wolf3D, you only have 1 life. So don't forget to save the game
often - the F8 key is your friend. You can enter a high score only after
you have finished the entire game, not everytime you die like you could in
Wolf3D. Compared to original Wolf3D the gameplay is generally faster paced.
The damage is not randomized at all, the exact numbers for all difficulties
can be seen in the tables below.

---------------The minimap----------------

Minimap in the bottom right corner of the screen helps with orientation.
Grey color on the minimap represents a wall, orange is for door, teal is
for blocking sprite (for example a fence or a tombstone), purple is for 
a tile near a key, light green is for your location and dark green represents
your visibility.

-----------------Controls-----------------

Default controls are the same as in modern FPS games - WSAD for moving,
mouse for aiming/shooting and numbers 1-5 for changing weapons.
A/D is hardcoded to strafe left/right, you can't change it.
By default the Y axis of the mouse is disabled, so you only aim with
the mouse and don't move forward/backward with it, but you can enable/disable
moving with the mouse in the control menu within the game.
