Super 3D Noah's Ark ECWolf Mapping Pack
by AstroCreep 3/31/19

This is a simple mapping pack for use with the dev version of
ECWolf and WDC, to make it a bit easier to use the extended 
features that ECWolf enables, like remote-activated doors/pushwalls,
flats, plane heights, light levels and more!

To use this, simply use this PK3 as a base for your project,
and using WDC, start a new project using Super 3D Noah's Ark as 
your base project, set MAXPLANES to 4 and 
load ec_noah.wmc as your map definition file.

To use the new features, I recommend reading my tutorials on
Zombie's WOLFSOURCE website, which details some of the 
features in depth.
