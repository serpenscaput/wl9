Mac Wolfenstein 3D ECWolf Mapping Pack
by AstroCreep 3/31/19

This is a simple mapping pack for use with the dev version of
ECWolf and WDC, to make it a bit easier to use the extended 
features that ECWolf enables, like remote-activated doors/pushwalls,
flats, plane heights, light levels and more!  Not to mention
the fact that WDC cannot make MacWolf maps, this at least works
as an in between (pc format maps using Mac assets) 

Since MacWolf's resources are stored and translated differently,
the XLAT has been rewritten completely for use with this pack.

To use this, simply use this PK3 as a base for your project,
and using WDC, start a new project using Wolfenstein 3D as 
your base project, set MAXPLANES to 4 and 
load ec_macwolf.wmc as your map definition file.  To play MacWolf
in ECWolf you must first MacBin your data files (the application and the
Second Encounter level file) and rename to wolf3d.bin and wolflvls.bin
(easiest way being on a modern mac type macbinary encode in a terminal window
and drag and drop files to window and press enter)
then open IWADINFO.txt in ecwolf.pk3 and remove the Preview flags from the
MacWolf defs.  Only the dev version of ECWolf supports MacWolf

To use the new features, I recommend reading my tutorials on
Zombie's WOLFSOURCE website, which details some of the 
features in depth.

Also note, Mac Wolf support is incomplete.  It mostly works
gameplay wise but it mainly doesn't handle the intermission
and menu graphics and scenario map information.  These can
be fixed in your mod by providing the missing graphics (mainly
fonts and menu graphics, plus the intermission is missing a
font and the pic is the wrong palette) and defining a mapinfo
file.  This pack includes the basics to get those working.

Since I am aware that MacWolf is incredibly hard to find,
I am also including the assets (sounds, imf format music,
walls and sprites) in a seperate pk3 file, so that this can be
loaded and used with PC Wolf3D, to use simply copy the assets to ec_macwolf.pk3
add the defs from textures.txt to the textures.txt in ec_macwolf.pk3 and then
use the pk3 as a base for your project.

Switch sound effect and menu graphics from Wolfenstein 3D

NOTE:  If you try to play a vanilla MacWolf mod or
regular ol MacWolf with this, it probably won't work right.  
Best to use a shim file and write a new MAPINFO.
