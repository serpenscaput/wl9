WOLFENSTEIN 3D: CLAW OF EISENFAUST
Port of SNES Wolfenstein to ECWolf
12/27/18 	AstroCreep

This is a port of the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D to
ECWolf.  This uses Executor's Second Encounter port as a
base, and then adds assets directly imported from the SNES
version of Wolfenstein.

This is not a complete experience, unfortunately.  Got a
bit impatient with the status bar and how small it is, and
did not feel like making a whole new one, so this includes
a modified HUD from ECMac and a few placeholder sounds and
HUD graphics left over from PC Wolf.  All sprites and textures
have been replaced with SNES counterparts, censorship and 
all.  Save the free world from Staatmeister and his Master
State!
