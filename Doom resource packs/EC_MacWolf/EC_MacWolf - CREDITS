This resource PK3, when used with ec_macwolf.wmc, makes it so you can
use the Mac version assets with PC files, copy
the contents of this pk3 to your mod (along with ec_macwolf.pk3, paste this afterwards, copy the texture defs manually and paste in file)
Afterwards, all tiles will load properly with PC Wolfenstein
