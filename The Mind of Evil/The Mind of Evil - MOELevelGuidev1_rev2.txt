I recommend you using this guide only if you get lost in the game or you want to get 100% level completion.

LEVEL 1
„Castle Entrance“
Comment:
Only level taking place in outdoor environment. That explains green floor,
walls and cyan sky. This level has level a ending trigger (no elevator).

LEVEL 2
„Sewers“
You need to kill the guard first to be able to push both walls.
Comment:
„Brown level“. I was kinda worrying to introduce „double-push“ secret
straight in 2nd level. Especially when there is a gold key behind it, but I
think you will manage it.

LEVEL 3
„Barracks A“

LEVEL 4
„Barracks B“
You need to lure one of the guards out of the room,
otherwise you won’t be able to push the wall.

LEVEL 5
„Headquarters“
Comment:
Boss „Captain Blitz“ can cause a lot of damage in such a small arena.
Originally I intented to include secret level entrance in this level. Later on
I decided to not put these in boss levels.

LEVEL 6
„Prison A“
Comment:
One of my favourite levels. Thanks to ambient sounds, music and overall
creepy atmosphere of Nazi prison.

LEVEL 7
„Prison B“
Be careful to not push the wall in or kill any guard at sides.
Comment:
More open variant of Level 6. This level has a level ending trigger (no
elevator).

LEVEL 8
„Dark Cells“

LEVEL 9
„Gestapo Offices“
Entrance to secret level located in this level.

LEVEL 20
„Secret Archive“
(Secret Level 1)
Comment:
I decided to use one of the unused Wolf3D music tracks to give this level
sort of „secret“ atmosphere.

LEVEL 10
„Gestapo HQ“
Comment:
You will surely not find boss „Panzersoldat“ easy prey. Be careful for his
fellow Nazis.

LEVEL 11
„Security Depot“
There is a stealth puzzle in this level. There is a guard
going in loop. Quietly follow the guard to get through the
gold-key door. If you kill or alert the guard, you won’t get
out of the room!

LEVEL 12
„Danger Zone“

LEVEL 13
„Halls of SS“
Comment:
The largest level in the mod.

LEVEL 14
„Crossings“
Comment:
Cave maze level with little surprise along the way.

LEVEL 15
„Laboratory“
Entrance to secret level located in this level.

LEVEL 21
„Proving Grounds“
(Secret Level 2)

LEVEL 16
„Research Center“

LEVEL 17
„Mutant Revolt“
Comment:
I’ll be honest. I’ve got heavily inspired by „Mutant Uprising“ level from
Totenkopf SDL by Wolf-Skevos Jones. All hail WSJ!L

EVEL 18
„Felgesicht's Lab“
Comment:
Music used in this level is „Getting too Tense“ track from DooM II.L

EVEL 19
„Mechamutant“
To make Mechamutant mortal, you must turn off power
generator in bottom-right corner of the map!
