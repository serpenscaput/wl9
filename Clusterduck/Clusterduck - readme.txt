>>> What the hell is this?

A: A Wolf3D mapping experiment that involved 9 guinea pigs.  
   Each level was made in 9+1 rounds with a specific task. After each round the maps were 
   rotated amongst the authors.
   In other words, each map was made by 9 people.

   In round 1 each author made a full but basic map layout.
   In round 2 the next randomized person changed the wall textures for the existing rooms.
   In round 3 the next randomized person decorated the rooms with sprite objects and items.
   

	ROUND				TASK						Author
									
	Round 1: Basic Map Layout 	Room layout using 1 wall and normal doors.	Person A
	Round 2: Textures		Changing the existing walls and door types.	Person B
	Round 3: Objects 		Object decorations and items.			Person C
	Round 4: Enemies		Enemy placement.				Person D
	Round 5: Paths			Path arrows for enemy patrols.			Person E
	Round 6: Floors 		Placing floor codes (sound zones).		Person F
	Round 7: Secrets		Adding secret rooms.				Person G
	Round 8: Details		Map name, par time, music choice, ceil color.	Person H
	Round 9: Testing + Fixing	Fucking up the balance.				Person I
	Round X: Secret Level		Map made of 9 21x21 fields. Each by a person.	ALL

   If a map is unbalanced or too difficult you can blame the person of round 9 for not doing their
   task properly.

   Each round took varied amount of time due to 9 people having had to do each round. 
   Only after each and every person finished a round the project could move to the next round.
   The challenge for each person was to figure out the map (edits) made by the previous person(s).
   Some authors learned something new in the process while others were driven insane.

   Due to the authors mix the levels could be quite unusual or weird. 
	One map has 94 doors and another has 427 enemies.


>>> How do i play this?

A: Copy files from Wolf3D 1.4gt into the folder and double-click the exe or one of the .bat files

FILES NEEDED: 
   audiohed.wl6
   audiot.wl6
   vgadict.wl6
   vgagraph.wl6
