"All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal War." 
-- John, Milton, "Paradise Lost"

* Gameplay-information *

Storyline:
The  year is 1942. You are William J. “B.J.” Blazkowicz, the Allies’ bad boy of espionage and a terminal action seeker. 
Chemical war is about to be waged on a massive scale against the free world unless you can stop the egregiously evil Nazi 
General Fettgesicht from unleashing his toxic weaponry against mankind. You found the plans hidden in the dark woods near Kolberg, 
a large Baltic seaport in the Gau of Pomerania. Rumors are that deep within the stronghold of Kolberg the diabolical General 
Fettgesicht and his henchmen have perfected a technique for building a fierce arsenal of chemical weapons using heavy water 
materials from installations in occupied Norway. It’s so far removed from reality that it would seem silly if it wasn’t so sick. 
But what if it were true? 

Armed only with a knife and a Walther P38 (so you can use any German ammo you might find), you must make your way to the 
General's private quarters and put a halt to his diabolical doings. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere inside.

* Weapons * 
At first, you have only your pistol and your knife for protection. When you run over a new weapon, you'll automatically equip yourself with it. 
As the game progresses, you'll need to choose between firearms. The numeric keys select particular weapons. The weapons are:

1. Knife: This stainless steel blade is a little better than nothing.
2. Walther P38 pistol: The only weapon you start out with. But you'll use anything in a pinch, no matter how pathetic it may feel.
3. MP-40 Schmeisser Machine Gun: Delivers a heavy punch at close range and a generous pelting from a distance.
4. Chaingun: The prize of the military's arsenal. Great for clearing the room of those unwelcome guests. Shoot it and see for yourself.

Ammo is found on dead enemies and also scattered around in both ammo clip and 25-bullet case variants.

* Health *
When you're hurt, you'll want to get your health back as soon as possible. Fortunately, food, Medikits and Stimpacks are frequently scattered around. 
Grab them if possible. Stimpacks give you a quick injection of Pervitin methamfetamine that make you feel like a new man.
Medikits include bandages, antitoxins, and other medical supplies to make you feel a lot healthier.

* Enemies * 
From the very first moment you enter the door, till the last gunshot of the game, you'll be fighting a host of baddies. 
Some are just regular soldiers with a bad attitude, others are straight from Hell. Don't say we didn't warn you.

Sturmabteilung Guards:
These are the most common enemies in Testament. Their only attack is a Pistol, and they must freeze and aim for a moment before they can fire. 
They can easily be killed with a pistol or knife, dropping a clip with 4 bullets.

Schutzstaffel (SS):
The SS are Machine Gun-toting men in black uniforms. These burly men are noticeably taller and larger than other enemies. 
They have the highest HP in Testament for regular enemies, requiring on average 5-7 bullets each to kill. 
Although their reaction before they unload on you is no faster than the guard, they fire in bursts and can inflict major damage with their weaponry.

Dobermann Dogs:
A canine of the German Doberman breed, this lil' woofy has a biting attack. Ouch.

Sicherheitsdienst Officers:
Officers are pistol-wielding baddies who are very quick and can also draw and fire their pistols much faster than regular guards. 
This makes them a force to be reckoned with. 

Mutants:
Mutants are undead captured U.S. Army soldiers subjected to a gruesome zombification process.
Mutants have guns surgically integrated into their chests, making them literal killing machines. 
While only armed with an automatic Pistol, they are easily one of the deadliest enemies in Testament. 

* Treasure *
Throughout Testament, B.J. may find various treasure items. They may be found in plain sight of major hallways, or deep behind secret pushwalls. 
These items have the sole purpose of boosting his score. The lineup of treasure is:

Cross, for 100 points
Chalice, for 500 points
Chest, for 1000 points
Crown, for 5000 points
1Up, for an extra life, 25 ammo and maximum health.

* Cheats *

We have also removed the necessity for goobers and the Alt + Shift + Backspace sequence.
Tab keys you can use:

Tab + G God Mode
Tab + I Give Items
Tab + N Noclip
Tab + E End Level
Tab + W Warp to Level
