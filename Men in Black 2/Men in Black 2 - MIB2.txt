First, let me express my gratitude to the following

ID Software/Apogee 
The creators of "Tesla Imp"
The creators of the "Astrostein Series"
The authors of the "Wolfen 60 mapset" a well done,
well balanced mapset!!

And finally, Bob Larkin,  for his
inspiration and insight.

 The story:

 Underneath the London metro is a complex of passages and facilities
dating back to the 1940's.  Converted to a communications hub in 1953
by the above top secret "Men In Black" organization, it was finally
upgraded to the European Operations Center HQ in 1962.

 At approximately 13.37 hrs, this date; the facility
 has been overrun by forces only known as the "Shadow Alliance" Your
assignment is to infiltrate the facility, disable the force fields and allow reinforcements

from U.N.I.T. to enter. If you see a Blue Police Box in there,

LET US KNOW ASAP!!

Good luck and good hunting!
