                         ==========================
                
          Feel the heartwarming, pleasant experience of my joyful game 
       where you send helpless, innocent people to a warm, magical place 
       called 'Down Under'. Okay, so it's not as nice as I mentioned
       above. But look at all the lovely comments:

         "A very unique and wonderful masterpiece, beautifully
          engineered, one of the year's finest games to hit the
          shelves, great job!" - Chris Chokan

         "I love the weapons, especially the Lazer Tongue, it
          kicks Butt (I'm not allowed to say ASS)" - David Lacasse

         "Mopars Rule & Fords Drool, this has nothing to do with Chokage
          but it's the best I could get from Paul" - H.K. Mailloux

         "I love Chokster's Super Chokage, it's the best game ever
          created! Awesome!" - Unknown

          If your looking for romance & friendship, read a novel. If 
       you're looking for destruction, horror, and a game that's been 
       outdated for over five years, try Chokster's Super Chokage.

** Welcoming Message **    Note: This version is still under construction
***********************

   Greetings! If you've played Chokage V1.x before, you'll probably notice
   many things have changed, and many things have stayed the same. Who knows,
   maybe you even like the old version better than this one... but one thing
   is for sure, there always was and always will be lots of ass kicking, and
   that's what this game is about. Kicking people's asses, and many times
   getting a kick in the ass yourself- hell, even I get kicked around
   sometimes. Well, I hope you enjoy my twisted, boggling, but nevertheless 
   enjoyable game of challenge and most importantly... FUN. Have a blast!

Krazzy Chokage
----------------
Think you're too good for Chokage? If you answered yes... you've got to be
kidding me. You're too good for Chokage??? Wow, I'm shocked. Are you an
eccentric genious or just from another planet? For that minority of people
that are in need of an even greater challenge, feel like pressing the "K"
button, want to eat your lunch and play computer at the same time, or in the
mood for something really different; this is for you. It's basically just a
combination of lots of weird phenomina backed up by giant stories from a
guy who has too much imagination for his own good. Try the game from many
new viewpoints; an disabled convict, a reincarnated dead guy; or even
more frightning, a robot created by Hitler. Think THAT'S scary? Read the
story, for more....


     The HELLenstein Duo have linked up with another force to create the
     Ultimate Team to take over the world!!! They have caputred you and
     will either do one of three things to you:


   PLAN A    ---- easy mode

        As an escaped convict from Chokster's chambers, you find out you've
     crossed a dead end. Both legs and one arm dismantled, you turn around
     on your silent wheelchair and decide to search for another way out.
     Chokster's strange idea of 'stealing you bulging body of muscle to place
     on himself (to make him an even greater threat)' is all you can think
     about. Good idea, but strange.

     Advice:  Because the use of a Supersoaker and WaterTorch requires two   
              hands (to fire), you're stuck with an invention you created
              during your escape called the 'Lazer-Tongue'. And since your
              only hand is busy holding up your invention, you will have
              to force the doors open (by running into them, in the hopes
              that you smashed into the door hard enough for it to open).

                                             ** Somewhat Difficult

   PLAN B    ---- medium mode
  
        Travel around as a dead man, only reason for living is because of an 
     old experiment proven by Dr. Schabbs himself. Once in full health, you 
     will be be under full control of the master who set the experiment (Like 
     B.J. Blazkowitz's Clones and the Mutants from 1945). Hitler is looking 
     for TEN full time 'Muscle Chokan' workers.
  
     ONCE IN FULL HEALTH!! Hitler sent out some of his guards to give you the
     recommended dosage of water to get you back from your dehydrated state 
     and also left some breakfast behind. Everyone seems to know about the
     experiment and will do anything (spray water, blood, smiley faces [a
     happy person is a healthy person] even fix up your injuries manually) 
     to get you well. Hauling up on Germany Lake water will have no effect on 
     you, and blood from prisonners is no treat. But in a time where you are 
     unhealthy, food can be hazardus to your health. Another things is, dead 
     people are too weak to carry guns! So you'd have to be a hell of good 
     fighter to try and face Hitler. And attempting to get past Chokster 
     would be EXTRMELY difficult.

     Advice:  There may have been some mischap with you "inventory/info meter" 
              during the experiment, cause you know Hitler wouldn't be stupid
              enough to send you to Floor 8 while you were 'evolving' (and 
              because you've seen this place before, it's definately 
              Floor 1). The 'health meter' on your watch seems to be correct 
              so far though (Damn thing would always overload and show dead 
              people as 899%) and whenever you're over 90%, it will not tell 
              you your REAL health (one of Sam's jokes is what it is). All I 
              can say is look in the mirror once in a while to see what kind 
              of shape you are in. The mirror is your best reliable source.

              The 'Lives' on your meter means 'how many Muscle Chokans' are
              alive and under the power of evil. Once there is TEN, the 
              cycle of evil will be complete, and the original Chris Chokan
              will be no more. The devices that alter the Muscle Chokan's 
              brain waves to respond to Hitler and Sam are hidden in Red 
              Bubble Shaped Spheres with your face on them. Destroy these 
              bubbles, that will destroy the Muscle Chokans (their brains 
              will explode from the radiation).

              At the confrontation table, even though you ARE Chris Chokan; 
              telling Hitler you are as Macho as Chris Chokan would be out
              of the question; the place will then be guarded with five
              times more security. Just tell him you feel as wimpy as a 
              Mama's Boy, and if your missions is then succesuful, attempt
              the next skill level at your own risk.
              
                                          *** Difficult

   PLAN C    ---- hard mode

        Working as a Robot, you were sent to the enterance of Castle Chokage 
     to stop intruders from entering the premesis. Designed in the experiment
     lounge by Hitler, your programming was computer generated and is in
     Binary form. The Robotic form that you were created in was very poorly 
     made and it was extremely difficult to see though the eye scopes. While
     programming you, Hitler forgot to change the number NINE into computer
     language. This seemed to come off as a good thing for you because while
     you were guarding the premesis, your INTAKE OUTAKE brain feed crashed
     because of the number NINE was not recognized to your system. So now 
     your brain is fully under YOUR control. But when your brain crashed, 
     your steel upper body blew a fuse and rotated 180 degrees (which means 
     you have to walk backwards). 
     
        Your weapon is mounted at your chest (placed in the same format as 
     the mutants weapons in Castle Wolfenstein). You were built with no arms, 
     so the use of an extra weapon is obviously impossible. The gun is made 
     with a sharp point at the end so when it is empty, it can be used as a 
     stabbing device (although it is very hard to use). If you were built 
     with no arms, there has to be some other way to open doors. Your 
     programming only requires the use of 4 movements (the arrow keys).

     Advice:  There is a "Safe/Danger" warning that will occur when you are
              either in very good shape, or very bad. Sound like a pretty
              handy mecanism? That's only on how you look at it (and if you
              can find how it works). The good thing is that it warns you,
              (and isn't it cool to have a new gadget hooked up?). The bad
              think is that the Warning is the SAME symbol for both cases.
              Sometimes, you'll just have to rely on instinct to know if it
              is merely telling you that you are Safe, or in grave Danger.

              Also, you'll notice that the champions names contain some really
              odd characters; that resemble letters. This is another computer
              engineered language, called the Robitic Alphabet. And here's
              the fun part; getting into the challenging highscores and
              figuring out how to make your wonderful name. It's not just
              as easy as typing in My name is F-R-E-D... you'll have to find
              out what key gives you the F (here's a hint, it's not F), the R,
              the E, etcetera. Not only that, sometimes the letter won't even
              exist from typing in ANY of the letters, in such a case, you'll
              either have to change the name you've picked, or improvise. For
              example, let's say that there is no "C", no "O" and no "S" in
              the robotic alphabet, and you want to use "Cool Cats" as your
              name. Some solutions may be to use a zero in the O's place and
              if that also proves unsuccessful, try changing the name totally
              to something like "Kewl Katz". These hints might also help you
              in finding things OTHER than just how to make your name... and
              if you can find out how the whole robotic system works, then
              you're definately one of the Champions.

                                              ***** Extremely Difficult

  NOTE: There are ways to Cheat in Krazzy Chokage (although they could have
        been disabled (with a little extra hard drive space), but it would a 
        be a shame to waist all your talents for cheating. Plus, there's
        concequences (ex: If you cheat and Zoom in your Robot vision, it can
        never go back to it's original 'Difficult but Possible' Settings) 
        

Corridor 7 Music
-----------------
If there was one thing that was good about Corridor 7, it's the awesome head
pounding music. Is there any other reason why you would want to play that
game? My point exactly. So instead of waisting all that beautiful music
on some game that consists of 20 varieties of alien eye balls as opposed to
potential human body counts, and that doesn't even have great food and hot
girls to munch on; why not, you know... plug in the ghettos to Chokage and
start moshing those ugly nazis through the floor. To get to this Music Menu,
Press "M" at the CHOKAGE MENU.

You're still here? What's on your mind? Oh.. you're wondering why all the
original music for Chokage isn't created by yours truly?.... what did you say?
No, what did you say AFTER that? I made about everything else so why not make
the music too since I'm such a talented musician? Yeah, hehe sounds great; and
yeah, it would make the game seem more original, compelling and new. What does
compelling mean anyway? Oh yeah, I could dice out a whole CD of awesome songs
easily, but we're supposed to be talking about music for Chokage here. There's
already at least 30 great keyboard songs I exported from the old brain (some
even in the range of 10-30 minutes long, crazy or what?) that would go great
in the game. One main reason this idea has never been seriously considered is
because Bobby Prince is a God of music and you just have to love how great his
songs flow with the levels... and the other reason is because my keyboard
isn't midi compatible. What? No, my drums and guitar are NOT midi compatible
either... silly. Hopefully, there will be an upgrade or add-on that is loaded
with funky Chokan songs on it sometime while were both still alive... 

Stupidness
-----------
'The Stupid Choice' is what it's really called but that name was too big for
the screen on the Menu. Some choices aren't really finished yet (you'll notice 
that if you pick an option that isn't finished you'll be sent back to the 
beginning). So far there are 4 characters, here they are:

- Mr. Buff
  
    That's me, the strongest powerhouse of them all.  I bet you're tempted to
    be this guy. This is me in the future, and I changed my name to 
    Chris Buff, has a nice ring to it. (based off a true story)
    
- Bell-Bottom Jenny  
    
    My sister made this one (the story is about her). It's a kind of
    horror story (not that it's scary or anything)

- Horny George

    It just what the title says, you're a guy named George who is 
    Really Horny. ('Homie G' gave me the Idea for this one)

- Super Dave

    This is about a VERY ugly superhero named Super Dave. 
    (This was created by Me [Chris Chokan] & David LaCasse)


Note: If an option does not have a dot beside the number and you pick that 
      number, Stupid Choice will say: "This part of the game is not finished
      yet!" so avoid the numbers with no dots (when possible).
      

Example (#2 is not accesable):

The teacher tells you to 'put a lid on it', What do you do?
      
  1. Shutup before the teacher gives you a detention
  2  Ask her: "Put a lid on what?"
  3. Make up some kind of excuse for talking (this way you can talk even more)
  4. Tell her you don't have any lids, 
     she never told you that today we're doing 'Arts & Crafts'.
  5. Say: "Ya well---Your Mom!"


The Intro Sequence
-------------------
Hey, remember on those old Commodore games where they'd all start off with a
really gnalry screens with millions of moving, flashing colours; crazy designs
and awesome music? The good old days are back with this little "Thing" I found
in this game called "The Lion King". It was years since it's been edited, and
it sorta reminds you of those really bizarre intro ideas from the 80's.


New Missions
-------------
"How do you get the new missions?" you ask yourself. 
 Well, you have to beat Mission 1 first. 

  - When you beat the ICE MAN, he will reincarnate and when you try to 
    shoot him down again, there will be a WORD flashing on the bottom right 
    corner. 

  - Once you know the WORD, go into the Chokage Menu and press E 
    (Express Opinions) and then press 7. 

Every other ending boss with also conceal a WORD, only,
these words, you will have to find on your own.


Other Games
-------------
If you want some cool different Wolfenstein games like Commiestein,
JennyStein, Hemi Kid Rules (for Car Fanatics) or Pots And Pots Will Get No 
Vans; The Double-Trilogy (many classic games like Barney and Xmas). Contact
me and tell me which ones you want (They will automatically appear on the
Chokage Menu when you Unzip them to the Chokage directory).

If you want to make YOUR OWN game and have the FOREST.MAN, 
type X in the Chokage Menu and new stuff will appear. 



Awesomness
------------

This is an awesome way to get tubular STUFF, 
some of these cool things are:
                           
                           - Get Drunk
                           - 10 Doors, One Choice
                           - Best Music Bands
                           - Pick Colors (Wow!)
                           - You Can KILL YOURSELF!
                           - Get BUFF (Chris Chokan Mode)
                           - Become 'Kasper, the ghost from Hell'
                           - See big, stupid numbers (like 3745234230)
                           - You can find out how useless the "X" key is
                           - Watch a brown guy die while you're half asleep
                           - You can find out how many times you can make the 
                             game say "You are Jolum!" without opening the 
                             same door twice in a level
                           - Get 5,000 points for eight litres of Water 
                           - See "Disabled Chokster" (with no hands)

Here's how (this may sound a little complicating),

Leave the DEATH KEY down while typing the numbers on the keypad simultaniously 
of the answer to the NUMBER QUESTION then release the DEATH KEY in the Chokage
Menu. 

---Death Key---
It's a name of a food company (produces alot of Dairy Stuff) pronounced the 
same as a key on your keyboard but it is spelled differently, the food company 
has an extra letter in it (The extra letter is not in B.J.'s name), some 
products they make are "Silverwood Stirred Yogurt" and "Sealtest Yogurt"
and lots of Milk stuff. I know alot of you aren't from Canada and you would
have to travel here to even get a CLUE to what this key is, so let's just say
it's hidden in a word on your status bar in the game (not scrambled or
anything).

---Number Question---
How many levels there are in Spear Of Destiny; divide it by the number of
Officers there are on level 7, Episode 1, on "Can I Play Daddy?" mode on
Wolfenstein; add the amount of Pac-Man ghosts are in Wolfenstein episode 3; 
multiply by the number of colours your screen has to be to run Wolfenstein
(for really advanced, use how many colours your video card needs to produce);
add your total to the episode number that you meet Hitler; subtract this by 
number of guns you can get in Wolfenstein (even the ones you don't have to
pick up to get); multiply this by the number of "FINGERS" you (yourself) have
[unless you're disabled], multiply this by the number of levels you have to
go through before meeting Dr. Schabbs in Wolfenstein, add the total to the
number of eyes the "Last Boss" on "Spear Of Destiny 2: Return To Danger" has;
then subtract the answer by the number of floating Hitler guys (the magic
dudes that shoot out that bubbly red stuff) there are in Hitler's Level on
Wolfenstein; then add this to the number of planets in the solar system that
start with the letter 'M'.
                                          
Note: When the Code of Awesomness is finished being typed, the game will start
      as usual, but there will be a little something added to one of your
      menus but it is just there temoporarely (until you quit), use this new
      option wisely.

Word of advise: Chances are, you won't get the COOL stuff; there's only
                been one person in the entire galaxy to find the CODE OF
                AWESOMNESS, he goes by the name Giftmacher. It's not
                impossible, just VERY VERY VERY tough.






QUESTIONS
==========


Why Are The Guards Hangin' Off The Roof?
-----------------------------------------

IN THE PAST:   

   A long time ago, the Guards stood straight and followed the instructions,
but after a few years on the job guarding Castle Wolfenstein, some guards
took a new role, guard Castle Chokage. But what they didn't know was the king
of Castle Chokage (The Chokster) was a royal bitch. For the guards, this was 
pure hell and they started slackin' off because it was so boring and 
sometimes they would even fall asleep on the job. One gloomy morning, the 
king noticed a guard sleeping on the job and got so mad, he shook the Castle 
so hard that it got practically destroyed. Unfortunately, he lived. So did 
most of the Guards. Some of them were killed, others injured. The Castle 
still hasn't been fixed up very much. Some floors were somewhat out of whack, 
all but 2 floors had survived the crash (Luckily). After a few days of 
thinking about how to stop the Guards from sleeping on the job, the king 
insisted that they wear plungers on their feet and hang off the roof, that 
way sleeping on the job would be more agravating than standing. Some guards 
tried to get off the roof but they only injured themselves and were shot into 
the dungeons by the kings royal servants. 

NOW:

The crash has wrecked everything in sight, and Chokster is up somewhere else
with his pototo chips and soda pop muchin' down infront of the old tube not
caring a bit about what happened during the crash to his guards.  You (A 
prisoner sentanced to death by Chokster [Like many others] because of not
slaving for Chokster) are trying to escape from this dumpster. Watch out, the
place is swarming with police. The undertaker (Chokster's Ghost) is out to
kill you because he knows you're trying to escape. Nothing will get in his
way, he is invinsable and can harm you with a touch of a finger, your only 
hope of escaping from him is to open the fence to the CONTINUEUM (the next 
level you will have to face).


What in God's Name is Wrong With The Dogs?
-------------------------------------------
  Answering this is like answering the problem to a seven paged Math Question,
which means... yes, it's going to take a while to explain. But if you really
wanted to know:

 --Why Do They Flash?--
  
   They're ELECTRIC Dogs, the "Old Wise K9" (Max) stuck his paw into a light
   socket & told his wife (Maxeen) that sticking your paw into a light socket
   helps you live longer (he got this information from the "Dogs for Dummies" 
   book he stole from his master "Ken" who was watching Star Trek at the time) 
   & so his wife tried the "light socket method".  Unfortunately Maxeen didn't
   know her mate only had an I.Q. of 12 and that he was reading from the
   "DON'T" section. Their ELECTRICAL disorder got into their puppies & the
   puppies passed it on to their puppies and those puppies passed it on to
   their puppies... (you get what I'm trying to say, right?)

 --What is that THING attached to their head?---

   Well, if you were really thinking of raising one of these dogs, I'd suggest 
   you name him Chainsaw. That's right, if having a dog bite you with his
   dreaded, sharp fangs is painful enough, imagine a dog slicing a chainsaw
   into your leg. No more playing Captain of the Football team for you.
 
 --Is walking backwards the IN thing nowadays?--

   Come on, you've always known Dogs loved to chase their tails. And being
   an electric dog doesn't really skyrocket your intelligence does it? Having
   a tail that flashes different colours, what better reason to chase it.
   Although they never actually 'catch' their tail (and if they did, they'd
   surely regret it) by running backwards, never underestimate their effort.

 --Why Kill Them, they look so Friendly?--

   Ha! Yes, normal German Shephard look friendly perhaps, but these guys are
   aren't your angel breed. But really, all dogs hate being treated bad, nazi 
   dogs were whipped, slashed, tormented day by day. They have been trained to 
   kill intruders, nomatter how long it takes them, their life is a living
   hell and sending them to a warm, playful and fun doggy heaven would make
   their every dreams to come true. And you have a fun life, getting rid of
   all those evil souls who brought you to this dump of a place that doesn't
   deserve to even be called a Castle (Maybe a Junkyard or a gigantic shack
   would be a better name). If you want to have fun and feel like you're doin' 
   the right thing, don't let those dumb guards boss around the doggies (send 
   them to heaven) and send those freakin' bastards to hell. Hey, if you
   rather let the doggies kill you than you kill them, think about how stupid 
   that plan sounds, the guards get to boss around and hurt the doggies,
   doggies are in more of a hellish place than hell could ever be, and you're
   probably dead and thinkin' "Hey, I'm not ready for this yet" and the
   doggies probably don't have much more time to live because they only live
   about 13 years and they're probably already about 8 or 9 and won't get fed 
   enough to live much longer.

 --How do they fly like that, and why?--

   As every elementary student knows (atleast all the goody-goodies that pay
   attention), there are just some things that don't mix with electricity.
   Yeah, you know what it is, and you know that you're going to come across
   millions of puddles of them on your voyage. And these electric dogs are
   so interested in sawing off you legs that they don't really watch where
   they're going.

   So, in other words, if the dogs ran over a spill of water, they're going
   to get fried into serious ashes (which makes up for a high-paying cremation
   ceremony and funeral arrangements). When the guards were ready to ship the
   volitile dogs to a pound, a part-time physicist named Fred stepped in the
   room, and stated: "According to my theory, the electric charge of the dogs
   can be easily removed by shaving their hair with an electric razor." After
   Fred's death, the guards were really disappointed that they had to buy a
   new razor.

   Everything they suggested, from common things such as plungers, new guns,
   swim fins, and hiring a new janitor, to bizarre ideas like high heels,
   running in plastic bubble spheres, rolling the dogs in barrels, exchanging
   electric dogs for electric monkeys, all had some evil side effect. For
   instance, monkeys would rather search for bananas than preditors (and they
   make too much noise anyway), and barrels don't roll forever. Furthermore,
   everything was either too expensive or the dogs were just too stupid to
   figure out how to use them correctly.

   It was Mike who next suggested: "why don't they just wear balloons so they
   can float?". Of course, Mike was so high at the time that he was actually
   seeing the dogs floating through the air. The guards patiently waited, and
   waited, and waited for a better plan; but sadly, they never got one. And
   since then, the poor dogs had to find out how to navigate while being
   attached to a helium filled balloon. (inflate their brains with helium)

 --What's with those Faster "SLIDING" Dogs?--

   One of Einstein's theories is that when a human's brain reaches a certain
   point in evolution, there will be no room for the growth of hair; so if you
   somehow get really really intelligent (HA), you'll go bald. When a dog's
   brain reaches a certain evolution, he gains an extra boost of strength; or
   in the case of one of these Hydro Dogs, power. This extra power gives him
   the ability to slide around like a hovercraft; being able to move faster
   than his companions without even moving his feet. And like a spoiled child,
   this Super Dog always wants more. Many times he will turn against his
   friends and drain power from them, enough power to permantly leave his
   body; leaving the remaining dogs in a domino effect, stuck behind his own
   abandoned corpse. Where his spirit goes is still an unsolved case, but
   there are many superstitions and beliefs linking towards the subject; and
   like certain rock legends, the amazing ability of this canine only started
   to be explored after it's "so called" death.

   At first sight, everyone didn't think the corpse was even a real dog, just
   a statue that dropped from the sky. They gazed at it thinking where would
   be a good place to put this new, colourful decoration. The dog's master,
   known as a very dilusional coocoo straight from the clown factory, was the
   first to realize that the statue was his dead dog; and in his despair, he
   saw a guard (that he thought was an angel) hovering towards him saying the
   words "Woof! Woof! Woof!" who then froze in his tracks like stone. From
   seeing this, the looney man concluded that his dog was still alive and he
   decided to write a book about how smart and adventurous his dog was for
   reincarnating as a human and barking... but realized that he couldn't move;
   even though he was moving his legs, he wasn't getting anywhere and could
   not walk away from this once psychotic barking Guard. The guards came in to
   see what all the screaming was about, and laughed when they saw the old
   fool, running "on the spot" and screaming, the guards assumed he was just
   playing some new sort of "mime" game with all new rules and just left him
   there, unattended for. Who would have known that they would regret that for
   the rest of their lives.

   It was not until lately that they found the crazy master guilty of knowing
   the truth, and not just fantasizing some nutty story. And maybe with him,
   the mystery would be solved; but all you have to rely on now are a couple
   theories. Most of our representatives believe that the Dog's floating
   spirit may also be involved with the religious, supernatural and domination
   affairs in the nazi kingdom; but only YOU can really find out the details
   of this obscure "dog eat everyone's soul" revolution.

 --Where's the dog food?--

   Way back, dogs were used by the nazis just to hunt and guard. In other
   words, they were slaves. But now, things have changed drastically. I know 
   this defies everything I just said about the dogs being tortured and
   whipped, but the nazis have come to realize that the dogs in Chokage are
   brilliant, their colours, their weaponry are all sacred, and the dogs are 
   treated like royalty. They even made statues of them and called it "The
   Golden Dog", but only three exist in the known world. The dogs are so high
   classed that they can only eat the best, and what is the best food anyone
   has ever imagined to have? Yes, that's right. Cereal! WHAT? You don't love
   cereal? Come on... everyone loves it. Especially our hero Chris Chokan.
   Some of them (the "elders") have their own dog houses that are big enough
   to store dining rooms into. So, now you really know why you don't want to 
   let the dogs LIVE right? Because they are spoiled and have all the Cereal 
   (and because their chainsaw woven fangs really kill), why should dogs be 
   treated so good, with all the best food? When you get left over nazi Pizza 
   and overcooked bacon & eggs with vegetable bread toast that has NutriSweet 
   jam? There is no logical explanation for it, no dog will stand in your way, 
   YOU MUST HAVE THE CEREAL.

 --What are you talking about???--

   Haha... I don't have a clue, but doesn't it sound cool?

 --Don't you ever shutup???--

   Not sure yet, maybe one day I will... after everyone dies (probably because
   they're annoyed to death). Maybe I'll live eternally and bug the hell out
   of your future generations--- suckers, hahahahaha *creepy laugh*.


Who's That Little Kid Flying In The Muppet Babies Plane?
----------------------------------------------------------
  That's Pat, one of the Guard's little nephews, & he's brought along his 82 
brothers, 87 people in his family altogether (His mom got in the 'Guiness Book
of World Records' for 'Second most pregnancies by one woman'). Pat's 3 sisters
Jen, Melissa & Krystal all died in the war fighting for the Nazis (Pat's dad
"Zarnel" let all the boys stay home and watch the Tube with Grampa & chug Kegs
of beer (one of his sons died of alcohol poisoning on the 1st day of the war)
while the girls, both of their gramas (who both died of a heart attack during
the war) and Zarnel's wife were fighting for their lives. His wife lasted for
the longest time (about 3 days) in the war and then some nutcase (B.J. Blaze)
shot her with his semi-automatic. All their kids hate B.J. with pashion and
guess who's the hero of this game? No, not B.J.; Chris Chokan "Me", but we
both look exactly alike (the big muscles, the great face...) and the kids' Dad
heard that B.J. was lurking in Chokster's Castle (but it was acutually Chris
who was in Chokster's Castle). Their Dad hated B.J. so much because B.J.
killed his wife (not that he actually liked his wife, it's just because his
wife did all the chores and now he had to do it [he HATED work]. Somehow,
Zarnel convinced his kids to get some revenge on B.J. (Who was actually Chris)
while again, he was sitting with Grampa infront of the old tube and chuggin'
Kegs of Beer. The kid's uncle, "Mike" (A Guard) survived the war (According
to Joel the psy-kick "Mike survived the war", but Joel also believes Elvis
Presley is still alive & that the monkeys are gonna take over the universe
after they conquer the dolphins in a Rock-Paper-Scissors contest.) If Joel's
theories are true (Which is highly unlikely) and Mike IS alive, chances are,
Mike's one of those guys hangin' upside down in Chokster's Castle, and with
Mike's intelligence, he probably walked in Chokster's Castle asking for a
raise; he is known for his clumsy actions (most of the time his clumsyness
leads to hitting walls, falling, tripping over his sucion cups or even
forgetting put his belt on his pants (he loves red spots for some stupid
reason) and, no Mike, we don't want to see it.

  Don't be suprised if Zarnel's kids DESTROY YOU! They're real menaces.


Why Are There Millions Of BJs?
-------------------------------
   When Dr. Schabbs conducted an experiment to make dead guys come back to
life, he didn't know B.J. was involved. Remember in Castle Wolfenstein where 
you died several times before escaping? Well those dead BJs got mixed up with 
the other dead guys during Dr. Schabbs's experiment and now there's live BJs 
trained to kick your ass down the highway (in this case, down the elevator
shaft, wait a minute, there are not elevators anymore, Hmm? I've got it, 
they'll shove you down your Evil Twins HUGE throat [this actually happens 
with your Evil Twin Brother 'Chokster' in his Castle from Hell while you're 
trying to open a fence to one of the levels, the Evil Twin sneaks up on you 
from a bush and captures you, then his assistants turn you into a gourmet meal
[fortunately, the BJs really Suck at cooking and their eyesight aren't the 
best (Chokster's was too cheap to buy them Glasses and of course, all the BJs 
are exactly the same because they were all mutated from the same guy [But 
the original B.J. wore contact lenses]) and the BJs thought you were cooked to 
a Crisp, but you were only in the oven for 4 seconds, and when Chokster eats 
you, you're still alive inside his body (His body chemestry isn't anything 
like yours). Instead of going into his stomach, you go INTO HIS...??? I won't 
tell you this part, try and figure it out. It all happened so fast that you 
never noticed anything happened until you were in Chokster's body (plus you 
were too busy looking at your dumb "Ratio Chart" the whole time). You noticed 
that Chokster has an outstanding appetite (he ate the boxes from the pizza
[and you thought YOU were the only one who did that], he ate disks?, guns??,
doors???, even his own GUARDS???? [that must be the Guard's punishment for not
obeying Chokster, or maybe Chokster was just REALLY HUNGRY). You see Mike
(that stupid guard who is always loosing his pants) and you tell him that the
zoo's Baboon is smarter than him, BAD IDEA. Don't ask me how, but Mike
actually has "friends" and they all start coming after you with the guns
Chokster swallowed. As Mike & his friends were coming after you, this dog
tells you there is a way out of Chokster's body by the hole of his pierced
ear. How retarded, you can't go out by his mouth but you can go out by his...
wait a minute, why should you believe some stupid dog??? Then later some other
dog says that you're "TASTY" as he's shredding you up, True! 
   
   Meanwhile, outside Chokster's body, Chokster screams out: "BJ, I got a 
headache!  Are you sure that Human was cooked enough?". "How the hell should I 
know" yelled the BJ, "You're too cheap to get me Glasses!". Chokster got so 
furious he ate the BJ. Don't be suprised if you see the BJ going down 
Chokster's stomach. When you finally escape Chokster's Body, you run like 
Hell all the way home, hoping Chokster hadn't noticed you escape from his 
body. When you finally get home, your mom asks you where you've been all 
this time. Without even having to think about it, you decide NOT to tell your
mom the story. "Mom, uh...I just went out to Milk the Cows!". It worked, she
actually believed you, HA! It's pretty late so you decide to go to bed.

   As you are in the middle of sleeping in your bed, you hear some annoying
blabber-mouths talking so you decide to get up & tell them to SHUTUP! You were
always a very protective guy, those 80 gallons of water in your room could
actually be used for some reasonable purpose (unlike all the other times you
used them for your "Super Soaker 10,000,000", mostly for blowing away mom and
dad's personal belongings, furniture and appliances. The kitchen is pratically
empty because everything was destroyed and sent out on garbage day, along with
your sister Jenny, but for some reason the garbage man never put your sister
in the dump truck to send her to the junkyard, some stupid law I guess).  As
you go to feed your dog (Robin) he jumps up and starts attacking you (Must of
been because you haven't gave him any water since the last time he spilled it
on the floor [about 5 or 6 days ago]). After battling Robin, you find your mom
& dad just hangin' around (They don't look so good, must of been cause they
stayed up late last night). You feel a craving for some pizza (which you have
plenty of left from yesturday's supper) and gobble a few hundred slices of
them down (Nowonder why your so fat [I am not actually FAT, I'm Real BUFF &
Muscular, but let's just say I'm FAT for story purposes). You still feel
hungry for pizza and there's not even a crum left so you go to your sister's
room to get some money (Even though you're loaded with cash, you decide to
take your sister's money because you're saving up your money for a new Car
(Only need $69,973.05 more to get that new Viper GTX at Myroc). As usual,
when you go to your sister's room she fell off her bed again and "Yuck!", had
her periods on the floor. You decide never to go in there again, or atleast
until the next time you need (I should say WANT) to borrow (I should say TAKE)
some money from her. You've just about had enough of those guys next door
blabbin' away and grab enough Water until you're "Super Soaker" is packed to
toast those annoying chatter-boxes (Too bad you don't have you're "MEGA
KILLER-WATER TORCH"; giving the neighbours a spray of that would really tick
them off [That thing is DEADLY], now that I mention that, I wonder where
that stupid WaterTorch is, maybe mom threw it away somewhere because it
looked too scary)...

Hint: A long time ago, while you were working on ways of disposing the 
neighbours who hadn't paid you for cutting their wrecked lawn, you came up
with a chemical reaction that could freeze someone in a manner of seconds
(Sounds pretty cool eh?). Here's the ingredients:

5g       of Fleezum-Flazum
11g      of Cytoplasm
16mL     of George's Compressed Helium
10 oz    of Campbell's Tomato Soup
2        Pizza Pockets (Do NOT use Pizza Pops, they're too liquidy)
17,325   registered copies of Wolfenstein 3D
1        of Z.R. Frog's Technical Metallic Lillypads

  As you were walking down the road to freeze you're first victim (Marty),
you tripped over his stupid cat (Muffy) that came running out of nowhere and
you're "invisable goo" spilled all over Marty's bricks. You never really paid
attention to it until you noticed there was no more "goo" left (You couldn't
create more because George ran out of Helium). The "goo" still exists in the
bricks (that are now placed together to form a wall outside Marty's yard) and
it is said that if you walk backwards and then come out, you will not 
be frozen but instead, transformed into a magicman. It is also said that, if 
you use your own spells (like the "Filthy Nazi" codes), the goo will disappear 
and the bricks will feel like a normal brick wall. One witness, Brian, said 
his neighbour Brad (Marty's son) was cursed with these powers and as he said
the magic words "Tab-Jee" he turned into the BUFF Chris Chokan, with that 
power he could never feel pain, and as Brad said "Tab-Double-You", he just 
disappeared. If your really brave, find these so called bricks that they 
mention (if they actually exist), and test the "goos" powers (maybe it'll just 
freeze the life out of you).

  If you get the "goos powers" there is another mystery to uncover. Marty
knew about your "goo" so he made a concoction of his own to protect himself 
(It would turn him into a ghost.) Him and his relatives all used this goo and 
they were all transformed into ghosts, he tried to put some on his daughter to 
protect her but she thought it was gross and pushed Marty away, the goo 
spilled onto some bricks (that's an origional concept, eh?). So it's not too 
late to get a hold of this stuff. (Being a Ghost has it's advantages)


What is the Flying Heads of Death Syndrome?
---------------------------------------------
  Not only are Muscle BJ's flying heads deadly; but, when in groups, they can
knock you right out of the Chokage Kingdom, FOR GOOD! You'll never know how
many heads it will take, so be cautious of these flying heads, and destroy
Muscle BJ as fast as you possibly can.


Why doesn't the ICE MAN seem involved in Chokster's plot?
----------------------------------------------------------
  Chokster and ICE MAN aren't exactly partners; they're more like friends,
and when the angry death of Chokster arrived, the ICE MAN was furious and
wanted the killer to die a horrible death. Meanwhile...

  After escaping the neighbours; Chris, happily walking down the grass 
searching for the nearest route to L.A. to perform in the MegaMuscles show 
to be recognized as Mr. Olympia for the 3rd straight year, realizes there 
are some armed nazi guards following him, but strangely - not shooting
at him... 

"Oh of course, they must be fans; sorry, no time for autograpghs boys!"

  He is quickly surrounded by the guards and taken back to somewhere 
unknown in Death Valley to suffer a slow and painful death. His meals for 
the time being (until ICE MAN finds Chris a suitable punishment) include 
a big chuck of Nothing, two broken water pipes, 5,000 cubic meters of 
breathable air, and not very good tasting wallpaper. Any attempt of escape
will lead into DEATH!


How did they come up with the name I-D-I-O-T Mode?
----------------------------------------------------
  First of all, because you'd have to be an idiot to pick this mode. Hence
the name, Idiot Mode. So why do the guards seem so powerful? Because they're
idiots. And in Idiot mode, the stupider you are, the more powerful you are.
Whoever thought being a complete idiot could help you in life? Well, the
guards certainly knew, hoping you'd pick that skill level. That's right,
they KNEW about I-D-I-O-T mode (gossip can get around fast when you're stuck
guarding a stupid castle). But the chainsaw dogs on the other hand, what can I 
say; they're just stupid, REALLY stupid. You're better off running away from
these beasts or just avoid even coming across one of these slice-happy
powergods.


Why IS there Water Everywhere?
-------------------------------
  Ever since Germany had tried to burn down Castle Chokage for using the
mayor's mansion as a testing site for bombs, and for not paying their property
tax for the last 50 years... things have been pretty nasty (if you know what
I mean). Chokster got NATO to send in 700 water bombers to "water down" his
Castle; this led to the creation of some interesting new sea creatures (like
Dopefishes*, that were used as special meals to feed some new K-9 species who
were brought here by, what the guards claim, "A really stupid @!*... alien.")
But this story has a happy ending. Chokster somehow convinced NATO to blow up
the mayor's mansion that was just trying to do justice for it's own country.
What a great success story...

   * Dopefish (...Webster's description of): fish too huge and too brainless
                to live in a tank without breaking/eating the glass. They were
                genetically created by the mad Tom Hall from Fribulus Xax. Why
                they're not extinct is still a mystery....

Pleaure Toys

  Mmmmm.. gotta have those sex toys.

When You Bang Your Head Against a Chandelire, Why Does It Disappear?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  As a kid, you always loved collecting things. Beer caps, beer, razorblazes,
white and gray window frames, bungy cords, elevator buttons, porno, bugs,
friendly little dead fish, jeoprock... sawdust... CHANDELIRES. And as you got
older (and taller), you seem to "run into" alot of those damn huge lights.
OUCH! Using your "four finger discount" card, these chandelires will be good
to add to your fastly growing collection. Though they have no significant
value, the Chandelires are nevertheless THERE, so why not make a hobby while
destroying the evildoers? Collect all the chandelires you can. Start by in
Tiny Dude, there's 7 of them awaiting to put into your oversized pockets.


Dudes, Is It Summer Already?
------------------------------
  If you're looking for the swimming pool, you've come to the wrong place.
These guys in their Speedos are just dying to get a turn in the hot tub wells 
and the last thing they want is for someone to come and bud in line. And even
worse, all the full wells are taken; and the empty ones, well... I don't know
about you but I prefer swimming in water than falling 100 feet attempting to
swim through the air.

  But these guys aren't the brightest of loyal guards; picture this, a bunch
of dope heads in their SPEEDOS walking around conked up on the cheapest drugs,
jumping around; acting gay, and looking for a well. Now picture how aggravated
everyone else must feel around these fools. I remember a couple of times when
the guards got so mad they had to get Chainsaw to shut them up, yeah; Chansaw
did a good job of that alright. There were even times when the guards had to
post up signs like: "Don't smoke drugs in our Castle, we don't piss in your
pool." Apparantely, that sign just made things worse and the guards had to
post up another sign saying: "Don't piss in our pool, we don't swim in your
toilet." But... after the toilet incident, the guards destroyed every sign
they ever made and pinky sweared that they would never make any warning signs
to the SpeeDOPES again as long as they lived (which won't be long considering
you are going to destroy all those roof hanging freaks, along with all the
other unusual cast members of Chokage.)

  There were many tradegies in the Speedo clan, such as when Jeff (a lonely
SpeeDOPE that was always finding his way to George's corner) was in-humanly
jumping on a fence, and found out it was 10,000 volts, and when George tripped
over the air (as he recalls it) and destroyed a valuable red towel. The Nazis
were really pissed off at all this, and after the "Kurt" incident (this
deranged psycho loonie who would come on to any speedope that crossed his
path), they decided the horny bastards were even too gay and jolly for Castle
Chokage. So the requirements had to be changed, thank god that the first rule
they made was that the loosers had to wear atleast "shorts" in the kingdom.

Warning: If the terror driven Swimsuit boys see you, they will most definately
         think you are just there to bud in line to the hot tub wells. A nice
         cold spray of water will get these guys to negotiate.


Why Are All The Empty Wells Blocked Off?
------------------------------------------
   After little Johnny fell in one and never came back, people started
worrying. Then they decided to send a rope down there to save him (Duh! Why
didn't you do that in the first place you morons?!). The people cried out
Johnny's name down the well: "Johnny! JOHNNY?!?". But, Johnny didn't answer. 
He wasn't there. Two weeks later one of Johnny's friends, Mike (yes, stupid
old Mike), decided he would jump down the well to save him. Stupid as this
was, Mike never thought twice about it. Mike's mother saw him jump, but just
cried in despair (the village was known for their crying abnormalities). No,
Mike never came back either... but nothing changed. The well was still there, 
in the middle of the street, standing there like a cursed monster happy with
it's victims below, waiting for more kids to come play in it, in the well.
There was no security, no fences to block off the well. Then... it happened,
the most tragic event of them all...  Colonel Sanders and Corporal Chebooboo
were drunk out their minds on midnight of Thanksgiving, and when walking
through the street; yes, they triped over the well and fell in it. The nazis
truly believe this story, and since the day it was mentioned, so this horrible
experience doesn't happen again, they have blocked off all the empty wells. 


Is that Grimm Reaper?
----------------------
  No, Gary Ragland and his highschool buddies didn't forget to take off last
years halloween costumes, these are Nazi Reepers. Sure, at home dressing up
as Grimm is just some sort of pun; but these guys really take their work
seriously. And their weaponry seriously; in Castle Chokage, water is the
best resource for ammuntion, and their weapon packs more fire power than a
Lazer-Tongue can throw. Their cape looks like they just stole some ugly purple
bed sheets and attached it to their head... oh well, atleast they got the
colour right! Feel the wrath of a new form of undead mutant zombie ready to
kill, and Fear the Reaper!

"Hey, wait a minute..." you say. "what kind of idiotic reason do they dress
like this?". And of course, this question can be answered, because it IS an
idiotic reason. Well, one day, the lowlives that these guys are, were spying
on Chris (our hero) at a huge track competition on March 28, 1999; while Chris
finished racing his 30 or so competitors at three racing events (and somehow
got 18th place on all three of them, is that extrordianry or what?) and they
saw a very ridiculous looking man throwing watermellons at people and running
around wearing a flashy "Z-man" costume with a long purple cape under his hat
and some really huge "bug-like" shades, and after seeing this man clobbering
water bottles at Chris and his friends heads while they were all trying to
"long jump" at the same time (and failed, resulting in the bitter taste and
rough feel of giant portions of sand), the Nazi Reepers figured that this
"Z-man" character was a superhero with mystical powers (when actually, this
man was Chris's teacher, and a deranged fool that dances to "praise you"
infront of the entire school in spandex). And that night, they watched a TV
show (that they didn't realize was FICTION) with Grimm killing off loud,
annoying people with his axes and claws. They concluded that the Purple Cape
was what gave Grimm and Z-man their powers. Though they never found a store
that sold the suit that Chris's deranged teacher wears, they easily swiped a
few Grimm costumes... then got caught by the police and had to suffer through
a suvere punishment; which was, supply the police a year's supply of donuts &
coffee. You could imagine how much money was left after THAT, the Nazi Reepers
were so poor that they had to get their mothers to make them the outfits, and
paint their faces yellow with food dye #413. The mothers were NOT pleased with
this, one mother even scolded her son to his room, while another kept making
insults (that I'm guessing were supposed to be to her son), like: "you son of
a bitch, you bastard!". But it all worked out eventually; except for that
darned mystical powers thing...

Why is the zip file 1,111,111 bytes???

   Because I typed in this line; and than this line... bla bla bleckoseaber!


Who's that guy in the Cage?
----------------------------
  That's Charlie, he used to be the star of Chokster's Super Chokage. Then
something BAD happened. Hitler escaped from Hell. Remember when B.J. killed
Hitler in Wolfenstein, Hitler went to Hell. But one day, Hitler decided 'Hell
Sucked' and decided he'd leave, so he stole Satan's pitchfork and stabbed
Satan in the head (Ouch!). He got this idea while he was playing as 'Mr. Buff'
on 'The Stupid Choice'. Then after Hitler killed Satan, he ran out of HELL'S
EXIT (where this story originated from, I don't know). Then he did something
he was dreaming about doing all his life, he went over to B.J.'s house and
stole the Spear from B.J. living room (This was not a very hard task because
no one was home, B.J. was at the Gym, and his wife Amanda was in Hollywood
making her new movie "Biker Mice From Mars meet The Simpsons").
       
  With the power of the SPEAR, nothing could stop Hitler from his only goal,
to plant a Virus in Chris Chokan's new game "Charlie's Super Chokage" but
unfortunately for Hitler, Chris found the cure for the virus. Hitler was so
furious he tried to use the SPEAR'S powers to turn Chris into a Toad. But
Hitler said the wrong magic words & the Spear made Chris an Evil Twin Brother
called "Chokster". Hitler was not disappointed though because Chokster said
that he'd help out Hitler. Well, Chokster DID help Hitler, he took over
"Charlie's Super Chokage" by kidnapping Charlie. With only 5 weeks before the
'Release date' of "Charlie's Super Chokage", Chris had to do something to stop
Chokster, he would have to face Chokster, Man to Man. And now you (Chris) are
in Chokster's Hellenstein.



What Are The Tasks You Will Have To Face?
-------------------------------------------
There are many missions you will go up against in order to beat the game. 
Each task will be more challenging to face than the last. Many traps and
tricks are performed along the way, mastering and overcoming them is part
of the challenge. Choosing a higher skill level greatly enhances your chances
of death; especially as you move along. But the challenge lies strongly on
choosing the hardest skill of all: "I AM CHRIS CHOKAN!". 


Mission 1 
===========

   Finally, after years of thought, the deal was FINAL. Alex and Ross 
   (the head nazis) agreed to sell Castle Chokage to Chokster and split 
   the profits among each other, they didn't know WHY Chokster wanted 
   the Castle... but they would soon find out!
   
   Your mission is to get rid of Chokster, then escape. To escape, you 
   have to face Chokster's Legal Guardian the ICE MAN. You start off 
   in a Small Castle with only 2 hallways, as easy as this sounds, if 
   you take the wrong path, you will be wandering aimlessly for years 
   through the fields.


Mission 2
===========

   Deep in Shadows Forest, the lost flying sons await your arrival, walking
   vigorously through the bushes madly willing to haunt and kill you. As you 
   enter a vast area of the forest where a forbiden shack appears, you realize
   it's a trap as Pat's brother Jerry IV sneaks by to alarm his superior; who
   is currently busy letting out steam in the heat chamber.
   
   The news is out about a Secret Weapon planning to invade your country, and 
   for one reason, cause it's YOUR country. Zarnel's hate towards B.J. Blaze
   is so drastic that he will do anything to piss him off, only you are not
   B.J. but a far superior man (who shockingly resembles B.J.). And, Zarnel's  
   false identifying will lead your life into great disaster, unless the
   situation is dealt with (in a very gruesome, destructive way) by you.


Mission 3
===========

   Somehow... Charlie has ESCAPED!
   And now that you have killed Chokster, CHARLIE HAS CONTROL!

   Yes, after facing many obstacles, this is the Real thing! Charlie's Super
   Chokage... how it was meant to be. The star of this mission is of course
   the great SUPERNATURAL CHARLIE. And how he goes about making the world is
   totally up to him, and how you do you Journey is eventually how you die.
   Let's face it, Charlie is built like an oversized army tank, did you ever
   kill him in the Cage? So what makes you think you can fight past his
   ruthless army of killing machines and clobber your way past him now?

   So... why even TRY to get rid of Charlie? Well, not only does he have
   control of The Entire World; it seems Charlie always had a little crush
   on your highschool sweetheart. And we DON'T want to know what he wants to
   do with her, so save her OR get rid of Charlie (or both if you are really
   smart) before Charlie gets his hormones into mischief.

T-bone's Aid
-------------
These hint titles will help you find the super secrets in Episode 3.

Level 2: Fresh Godly Meditation
Level 3: Chip off the old block
Level 4: Common Five Must-be-queers
Level 5: Olympics for Dogs
Level 6: Substitutions
Level 7: Fire lures Moths to Death

Connection (some of this will be mentioned):
- (3) shoot the guard behind the forest-field at an angle so he can help you 
- (4) level backwards is level; dogs walk backwards; level 5 is about dogs;
      walk backwards through the void. There are 3 musketeers, must be queers
      need to hump something that moves, guards can open 3 doors for you.
- (5) an olympic sport is pole vault, poles are near the double doors. when
      you open the doors, dogs become athletes (olympic is the spawn of
      athlete for MAN files if you are in the forest), you can be an athlete
      as well. Press the multi-opening doors to walk through the poles.
- (6) this one is pretty easy
- (7) fire is a light, death is an ending. to postpone level ending and visit
      secrets first, you must not look into the light. if there was a wall to
      describe moth's intelligence, it would be steel plate; moths will be
      near fire, so steel plate will be near the light you must avoid seeing.

Plans for Level 7
Chandelires

- Connection to Pimpenstein (red ceiling)
- The double doors will unleash the pole to Skeleton Key in starland
- Not looking at the backwards guard will grant you the freedom to
  push the steel wall that will allow you to teleport beyond western
  exposure and recieve the treasure behind the plants.
- The Moch Water will still be active until level 9


Mission 4
===========

   If you find out how to get to this mission, you're either a genius, or
   you bribed Chris Chokan with a large sum of cash. Actually, it's pretty
   easy to get to this Mission (now you probably feel REALLY stupid.) It's
   name... Live Brains from Satan's Lab.

   The Brains behind this operation is unknown, yet we know it has something
   to do with the reaches of Hell. Brain has sent Many Traps for you, 
   including a trip to Hitler's Hellhole. You will have to ask yourself
   many questions before you figure out these tricks.
   
            .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .

  A note was left for you before your trip. Signed by Alex and Ross. This
  must be a trick, you assume. They can't possibly know about the plans in
  Satan's Lab, can they? The ANCIENT letter reads....

       It was a mistake to let Chokster rule castle chokage, I know that  
       now. But you have to trust me and Ross on this, we don't know why,
       we don't know how, but in dreams, we've seen it all. Someone's in 
       Hell, and they're plotting your fate Chris, they know you well,
       we've managed to illiminate the impossible and find some hints to
       help you on your way, here's what we found so far...
       


- Level 1: Chamber For The Physically or Mentally Disabled

   This is where all the stupid, good for nothing guys go.  Notice they're
   all either deaf or blind (some of them are both). So what are you doing
   in here?  Problem is, you didn't pass the "How to treat your GOD" Test
   and guess who's God?  Yep, none other than the Live Brian; This THING
   assumed that everyone in the "Mental Chamber" would be too STUPID to find 
   the exit so it was kept in the open to make things easier. 

   Find out if you belong with those Morons; here's how, it's quite simple: 
   - if you can find out how to escape, you don't belong here
   - if you can't find out how to escape, you belong with the "Nut Cases"
    

- Level 2: Bug-Eyed Conspiracy

   Before revealing the Secrets of the Level, meditate under a light with 
   "Bug-Eyed" Hitler for about 10 seconds, let a gust of fresh air in the 
   room to sooth the tension just before the session. Then shoot Hitler's 
   Left eye (from where you are meditating), a Guard will cry out a threat, 
   and the Magic Begins...
       

- Level 3: The Quiet Game    

   Did you and your brothers and sisters ever talk too much as a kid? Did
   mom ever say "Alright, we're going to play the Quiet Game, first person
   who talks has to do dishes!!!". Yes, the dreaded Quiet Game is back, and
   this time- the first person who talks gets to go to... HITLER'S HELLHOLE.
   
   It's between you, Jolum7 and Mike (the guard that really needs to get 
   a belt). Once someone talks (or makes a sound with their gun), the game
   is over. Your job is to NOT be the person to talk first (note that opening
   doors is not a form of talking). The best way to do this is to wait for
   Jolum7 to talk (he likes pretending he is Malord). 
  
   Jolum (the 7th of twelve) can never hold it in, he's always bound to talk
   the first minute of the game (but in Chokage, a minute can seem like a
   long time). Mike on the other hand, is a ZOMBIE- he won't even move if a
   giant elephant was going to run him over (well, with a punishment like
   a trip to Hitler's Hellhole, would you?). Once one of the other two talk, 
   by all means make all the racket you want. And the magic begins....

  
- Level 4: Spin the Bottle / Heavy Eddie's Bloodbath Scene

   Midnight parties would just never be the same without Spin the Bottle; 
   only this time, it's not just kissing... you have to go in the closet
   with them. And the really bad news is, you've got to get it on with
   Big Ursela. And if the guys don't see some real action going on, just
   imagine how pissed the drunk fools will be. Watch out for mad girls
   that like to get close 'Laurena Bobit' style.

   This isn't your normal Spin the Bottle game either, everyone is waiting
   for you at "The Other Side", and the Secret Weapon has been re-created,
   and Zarnel's twin brother Heavy Eddie (who has been trying to grow his
   hair for years just for this occasion) and another old geezer are eagerly
   trying to get another dead body count. And the major problem isn't that
   Heavy Eddie is hard to kill, it's that you have to avoid destroying him
   or making any noise whatsoever while the gates flood open in "The Other
   Side", and concentrate on looking for the fields, or you'll never move on
   to the next level (Eddie's machinery is electroincally hooked up with the
   fences, and if you destroy him, you are forever stuck inside, and the
   game is over).

- Level 5: Alternate Universe

  Imagine opening your locker and finding out that behind that metal sheeting
  is a giant room of whatever your dreams asked for; imagine yourself going
  into your trash bin, and falling into another room way undergroud, a secret
  room that only you knew about. Where time wouldn't exist, and where you
  could do whatever you wanted to during your stay. What great things would
  arise from your special place? I have made a special place just for you;
  and it is in that place where you can decide
  

- Level 6: Confusion at the sign of Description

   Chances are, the first question you asked yourself in Mission 2 will be
   answered in this tangling ride, which is, The Sign-Confusion Theory. There
   are many other theories you will be crossed with, but not like this one.
   This confusion conceals a great tool in which can open worlds. One of those
   places is the Golden Spaceship of Forbidden Treasures (found by Fido's
   hidden second mansion dog house). Playful, Adventurous Fido (who will only
   come out of the darkness for Chris Chokan himself), loves to explore. Being
   outside the intense confusion is an interesting and bright new world for
   Fido, and I'm sure you'd love to be there too. Fido's mate guards the house
   as he explore the known planet searching for food for their puppies. You
   must be brave to come across the sight of these dogs.

   There is another soul who is exploring. An evil soul. Watch out for this
   man, who searches for the Sign-Confusion Theory near the Soup Nazis
   kitchen (the kitchen is light blue and full of tables and breakfast to
   serve his guests--- but not you, you weren't invited). If the Theory is
   found by this man, he will surely make it so you won't be able to access
   it. You have 4 minutes to destroy him or the Theory will be forever
   unaccessable.


- Level 7: Creation of the Cloning Machine


- Level 8: The Limbo of Continuous

       "Lights can be a sign,
        but your ghostly powers are now mine."
                                                - Live Brain

- Level 1: Don't they ever clean this place?

This level is covered with swampy stuff. Janitor James quit cleaning this
place ages ago because he found out his Paper Route paid better than this.
James wasn't stupid like Mike though, he didn't ask Chokster for a raise (even
though he was only making $.05 an hour [Isn't there some law called minimum
wage, oh well). Back to the description, hmm... there isn't really much to say
about this level, except that it's a really BAD IDEA to "Meet your Nighmare"
before asking "Daddy" to play.


    Phase IV:   Don't kill Charlie or you won't be able to get to level 5. To
                beat the level, make sure NOT to shoot anyone when the doors
                are open (if you do, millions of Police and F.B.I. agents will
                come after you. When you attempt to get the silver key, F.B.I.
                Agent Mulder will be guarding it, don't shoot him until you
                are in the Purple People Eater area (That where all the Fake
                Hitler's are trying to eat you up) and wait until all the 
                doors are closed. The doors with lights infront of them have
                treasure in the room. The doors with chandiliers infront of 
                them mean are the first places you should go when you get the
                gold and silver keys.
                
    Phase V:    Opening one of the doors enables you to get in touch with a 
                Guard a long distance away, this door is protected by Hitler's 
                ghost, shooting while the door is opened would blow off the
                Guard's eardrums and the Guard will start wandering aimlessly. 

    Phase VI:   The crash has wrecked everything in sight... it IS possible to 
                get 100% on every Ratio. There is a new trick here near the 
                fence to the CLONE VILLA.

    Phase VII:  God, you are in for one HELL of a BAD TIME now. First you
                have to locate the Green Key then run and find an EXIT
                while running away from the deadly 100 'Chokster Clones'.
                Hint: There is a new trick by the STARS.

    Phase VIII: Lost in The LIMBO of CONTINUEUS, there is a way to outsmart 
                the Undertakers (the dead clones seeking revenge) before they 
                kill you. Your Ghostly powers will not work in this area. 
                Secret rooms lurk around a light in the FIRST Red Limbo 
                Hallway of Stretch.

    Phase IV:   The FINAL phase versus the twisted Live Brain.
       

Notes: 

     - The objet of this Episode is not to kill, it's to escape.  If you kill
       Charlie or the leader of the Mopar Mob (ICE MAN) than the Game makes 
       you go to a ratio chart that says "You Win", but you have not actully 
       won, The Brian switched your ratio sheet with some that he made up by 
       reprogramming Chris's Game and writing all this other Bull that he 
       stole from the the origial Wolfenstein (Episode 4), the original words 
       were "You're now in Hell, Notice the new RED MENU OF DEATH that looks 
       exactly like the other one but is actually different because it was 
       cursed by the powers of Hitler after he killed Satan. You must
       consecutively finish all the levels for the greatest reward.

OTHER ABNORMALITIES
=====================

Over Death Experience
-----------------------
  If you get shot at point blank range or attacked by many foes at once, it's
only natural to respawn your next live with "Flashing Bloody Eyes". To recieve
the condidion of your old eye balls back, press F5. If you want to feel even
more instant death, listen to the gruesome Corridor 7 Boss tracks; along with
it's other big hits like the famous "Let's just call Inspector" and the lovely
"Everlasting Sweetness", which makes you feel PAST dead and in Heaven.


CHOKAGE SOUNDTRACK
=====================

  Well, it's official, if having storylines for each episode isn't bizarre
  enough, here are some Theme Songs for Chokage. They are very abnormal and
  weird, so be prepared for the unexpected. You can find these songs on the
  "Chokage Soundtrack". If you have Windows, you can even play these songs in
  the background while playing the game (Wooohoo!). There's many other songs
  on there as well, I'd love to mention them to you, but a readme file can
  only be 'so long' before people start calling it a book...
  check it out---

   Mission 1
   -----------

  - CHOKIO.WAV (Chokster's DeathTrap) 3-97
    This is based off Coolio's smash hit "Gangster's Paradise":

    As I walk through the kingdom of the Castle of Chokage,
    I take a look at my health, and realize it's 1%,
    Cause I been blastin' and shooting so long that,
    Even my ammunition is pratically gone,
    But I ain't never killed a Nazi that didn't deserve it,
    Me be bullied by that freak, you know that's unheard of,
    You better watch out for Airplanes, & for Big Dudes,
    Or you and your friends are likely to Choke,
    I really hate that pizza but I gotta eat,
    All those anchovie things got me turning green, oh!
    Chris is the kind of guy that all gamers like to be,
    Pumpin' iron through the night,
    Never quitting in the big fight;
    Been spendin' most our lives, 
    Blasting Nazis in Chokster's Hellenstein,
    Wish we had better lives, 
    Than this torture with a million armed Nazi guys,
    Stuck here until revived,
    From the shock of Chokster's Brain Size,
    This is how we live our lives,
    With the feeling of hate before our eyes.

   Mission 2

   High as Flying Sons, Flying on the highest of dangerous Drugs;   
   High as Flying Sons, airborn fool and there's no easy landings;

    (3rd Stanza)

    Then one school morning, that HOT girl called me up,
    She said she'd like it if I met her at her STOP,     (Woof!)
    I bouced up walls, and smiled at the thought,
    Who could've known that that babe would have ME caught,

    Went to the the bus stop, with all my stuff,
    Started wondering if I should act tough,
    I waited hours, she never came,
    Then she snook behind me, called out my name. YA!
  
    (4th Stanza)

    This was GREAT,
    This chick was AMAZING,

    From so far, I thought hard. We went to town, and joined the bar.
    There we saw, another car, a familiar car, and NO IT CAN'T BE... 
    There was the car, behind the bar, no too far, was OH MY GOD...
    He appoached the bar, walked like a star, I know who u are, YA IT CHARLIE!

    STOLE HER AGAIN! THIS IS THE WAY THAT THINKS GO, YOU GOT TO KNOW, YOU 
    WERE TOO SLOW, HA! STUPID AMATEUR! LEARN THE RULES! I PLAY BY MY OWN GAME! 
    I mean this was BAD, this was really BAD, I had to something.. and FAST.
    
    Cause this girl was MY Girl, I wanted her since she said 'Hi Boys' 
    In Gr. 10, I wanted her I needed her... 'Hi Boys'
    Wanted her, Needed Her, had to be near to her 'Hi Boys'
    This may be sound PATHETHIC but it's obviously true 'Hi Boys'
    
    I've got this weird LOVE spell and I've got to have you 'Hi Boys'
    Charlie's a pot head he's not good to you, 'We'll what do you know'
    If you listen to me I will listen to you, 'She coming back!'
    Come to my life, I am begging you to, 'She coming back!'
    Cause right now I'm single, I'LL ONLY SETTLE FOR YOU!!!
       (5 whole minutes of intermission-- with some added guitar)

    (5th Stanza)

    Me & Charlie, got into a brawl,
    I kicked his ass, and he left by just a crawl,
    People laughed as he took his last fall,
    And did I mention that I wasn't hurt at all,

    On that save evening, I heard it on the news,
    There was a kidnapping on 7th avenue,
    The victim yes, was the girl I knew,
    Got the machine gun, and headed forrrr... and hunted forrr...
    and searching forrrr... and I pointed it at YOU!

MORE MUSIC???
===============
               
Hey, why don't I just GIVE you the words to some of these VERY VERY STUPID
songs??? I've made WAY more songs than this, but these are the only ones that
were created when I was actually bored enough to write the lyrics on this
insane text file. If music was smoking pot, this would be what it looked like:

- WAR.WAV
  
  (War March of the Rejects)

   There's a new war going on, and it is just as baffling as it is 
   NON-COMPREHENDABLE, the only way to find it is by backtracking to see
   what's left. Reverse the War and it will play as followed:
   
    He's the paper boy,
    Makes anouncements up...
    Nooo.. more taxies, 
    It's not the herd---wake up, it's Chineese Masacre!
    Nooo... more caffeen;
    Nooo... me lend sissy things out,
    This is the WRONG purple chocolate,
    So i turn off noisy bop

  - MONSTER.WAV
    This song is called "Nursury Boy". Based off a true 
    story of when my sister was born.

    Johny, turn the light off,
    No, the dark is scary,
    Go to bed or I'll come down there,
    But dad, what if the boogyman comes after me in the middle of the night,
    There is NO BOOGYMAN,
    But dad, he was here last night,
    SHUTUP AND GO TO BED,
    Well, Okay daddy--- (Shrieking Noises)

    Save me from this beast, 
    Save me from this beast he's gonna get me now,        (Monster Noises)

    He looks scary, what should I do?                     (Monster Noises)
    He's coming to get me, I'm not sure what to do,
    He's eating me, (GULP!)
    I'm Dead, ('There is no boogyman' - In the background)
    That's the end of, the end of me. HA HA HA HA HA HA!

  -- Note to self: Umm.. uhh.. maybe I should put the BETTER Heavy Metal
                   Monster song on here cause this one is gay! 


***The next songs have not been made to a WAV file***
      (They are in order from oldest to newest) 

- (Low-Life Hercules)
   This song has the tune of that old Hercules Cartoon song, I wrote this 
   when I was like 7 years old.

    Hercules, he's a sick, gay fellow,
    Hercules, he's made of Jello,
    Flying through the air,
    Wearing purple underwear,
    With a temper like a bear,
    Never brushed his hair,
    It's the GAYLORD--- Hercules!

    Note: Lately people have been calling ME Hercules, 
          so I it would be a shame if this song went public.
    

- (Screwed Spider)  
   These songs are based on that Spider-Man commercial, 
   Here's the original words:

    Spider man, Spider man,
    Does whatever a spider can,
    Makes a web,
    ?
    ????
    Oooooo! That's the Spider Man.

    New, Improved Versus (Ha!):

    Spider man, Spider man,
    Lives with Oscar in a garbage can,
    Makes a web,
    Lives in it,
    Then gets tangled and dies in it,
    Oooooo! & they call this guy Spider-Man???

    Spider man, Spider man,
    Lives with popeye in a garbage can,
    Makes a toaster,
    FRIES himself,
    Then gets mental and looses health,
    Oooooo! What a stupid Spider-Man!


- (High School Hell)
   The melody from this song is off of "Heaven On Earth".

    Oooo Baby! 
    Do you know HOW that SUCKS,
    Oooo HELL is a place called CONFED,
    They say in HELL, HOMEWORK comes first,
    They only have it at a place called SCHOOL,
    They only have it at a place called SCHOOL,

    In this world we are just beginning,
    To understand the torture of HIGH SCHOOL,
    Maybe I was afarid before,
    But I'm not afraid, TO "DROP OUT" anymore.


- (Santa Hires Satan)
  The melody of this song is off of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"
    
    Chris Chokan the Massive Powerhouse, (Powerhouse)
    Had some very Giant Pipes, (like Arnold Schwartzanegar)
    And if you ever saw him,
    You'd say his Chest Muscules make him look like a girl, (big pecs man)
    And all the low-class wimps, (bone boys)
    Used to scream and call him names, (like Mr. Buff)
    They never teased that Chris guy,                       
    Or they'd be crying with pain, (like ??? Babies? Winney dogs?)
    Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
    Santa came to say, (Ho! Ho! Ho!)
    Chris Chokan you are so bright, (Like a light bulb)
    Won't you guide my sleigh tonight, (How much does it pay,
                                        More than your stupid paper route,
                                        Fine, you Old HAG!)
    Then all the reindeer were Jealous, (Jealous)
    As they shouted out with hate, (You're DEAD Chris!)
    Then Chris pulled out his Machine Gun,
    And blew those Poor Suckers Away! (Asta la vista baby Reindeer!)

    Then one sunny Easter Eve,
    Easter Bunny came to say (Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!)
    Chris, my man, I hurt my leg,
    Can you deliver my easter eggs? (Forget it, ya' screwy rabbit)

    Then one drowsy Thanksgiving Day,
    Turkey came to say (squak! squak! squak!)
    Sparing my life would be nice,
    Find someone else to sacrifice, (Fuck you Bird! Dad, 700 F good! 
                                     A little more heat Chris,
                                     Sure dad, 1700 F sound about right!
                                                                     Tzzz!)

- (Gimme a Friend cause I'm a Loner) 
  Based off the song 'All by Myself' by Green Day.

  (I play on Guitar)
  {You suck, gimme the guitar;} (says an unknown loser)
  "Okay if I, a 2 month guitarist, can't play it; 
   There is no way in hell you can play it!"
  (The music from Green Day "All by myself" comes on)
  Damn.... nevermind

  And there you were.... with BOB!!!????

- (Mr. Unpopular)
  This isn't really a common tune, I kind of made it up.

  <Duke II, Level 5 sound, but not quite (My melody sounds better)>

  Mr. Unpopular,
  What do you say?
  You can have it my my way or your own way,

  Mr. Unpopular,
  How is it +now+?
  You really got nothing to lose, so try it out!

  (Low voice)
  You fuck up once, you fuck up again,
  The only problem is no one gives a damn,
  You get through life, being shy,
  Is this the life you want, (Drums constantly beating) or despise?

  (Duke)

  DIN DIN DIN DIN DIN 

  Mr. Unpopular,
  What do you say?
  A l l  y o u r  l i f e  has been swept away,

  Mr. Unpopular,
  Are you gonna +try+?
  It takes a man to be one, so don't be +shy+,

  (Metallica "Justice for all" sound)

  It's all in the way you look at things,
  That's how you find the way,
  Start by little conversations, 
  And end up with a friend.

  Don't try to be like others,
  Just follow your own way,
  But don't just stand there being..... Mr. Unpopular

  Mr. Unpopular,
  Mr. Unpopular,
  Mr. Un Popular, YOW!

  (For extened only with MR. UNPOPULAR)

  I don't want to be popular,
  Don't want a hit,
  I don't need to be Anyone,
  I don't want to be --- SHIT!.
  
  (Music for about 30 sec.)

  
- (Don't hug me Gaylord!)
   This is about a guy with serious problems, it was origionally 3 
   different songs, but... I changed that!

   Walking, I see your baby talking,
   You've got to stop your stalking,
   I see you really BLOCKING... the freakin' street!
   
   Limping, you can't manage to move,
   Get back into the groove,
   What's with the attitude... you fuckin' quack!
   
   FAT THING... don't you wish you had an alliby,
   FAT THING... don't you wish you could die,
   FAT THING... people mistake you for an elephant,
   FAT THING... gee, i wonder why? (sarcastic tone)

   Officer, officer! What's the problem?
   This lard ass here is COMING THIS WAY!!!

   What's the problem? Here's the problem, you're the problem!
   What's the problem? Here's the problem, you're the problem!

   (repeatative music comes on with a reporters voice)

   Jason Beef has a triangular board. He lived beside a farm... and fucked 
   the cows, which HE though were his mothers. Sadly for him, the owner moved 
   away. He was desperate for something (and his best friend, 40 year old ??? 
   had not showed up for weekly pornos). Seaching everywhere, he realized an
   innocent looking board, AND...

   FAT THING... don't you wish you had an alliby,
   FAT THING... don't you wish you could die,
   FAT THING... people mistake you for an elephant,
   EARTHQUAKE.. gee, i wonder why?
   
   FAT THING.... you make yokozuna look in shape,
   FAT THING.... watch out he might explode,
   BEEF......... feed the need!
   DOUGH BOY.... WHAT A LOAD!
   
   ...(lots of cool bass tunes go by)....
 
   World, world! here he comes,
   Watch out folks, he brought his MOM!!!

   What's the problem? Here's the problem, you're the problem!
   What's the problem? Here's the problem, you're the problem!

   (Storyteller Voice):
   Okay, so I'm walkin in the bar.... usual day. All the girls hitting on
   me and THEN, this Beefy thing tries his moves and scares all the chicks
   away. Pissed off, I YELL OUT:

   FAT THING... don't you wish you had an alliby,
   FAT THING... don't you wish you could die,
   FAT THING... people mistake you for an elephant,
   FAT THING... gee, i wonder why? 
   
   (Narrator Voice):
   Ya, well it's a winter school day and the bus isn't here yet. So everyone
   decides to throw snowballs at that walking ball of lard Beef. So what
   does he do, TRIES TO HUG ME AND CRIES "save me Mr. Buff" ????. What could
   I say to this enormous lard with legs?... either THAN:

   FAT THING... don't you wish you had an alliby,
   FAT THING... don't you wish you could die,
   FAT THING... people mistake you for an elephant,
   FAT THING... gee, i wonder why? 

   FAT THING... how you live is still a mystery,
   FAT THING... you weigh more than canada,^
   FAT THING... all your money's spent on groceries,
   FAT THING... and you wonder WHY?   

   When you were born... the doctor slapped YOU,
   When you were born... your mom exploded!^
   When you were born... the doctor had NO TIME to slap your mother, he
                         was to busy trying to shove you back up her womb.

   (three taps on the drum)

   FAT THING.... he's the mother of the Tellitubbies,
   FAT THING.... and lives with Winnie the Pooh,
   FAT THING.... he just ate the Pillsbury Dough Boy factory,
   FAT THING.... and now he's going to eat YOU,

   FAT THING.... you make yokozuna look good,
   FAT THING.... I knew that you would, cause
   FAT THING.... you're just a walking blob of SHIT!
   ..... ya, a walking blob of SHIT!

   (last bass tunes)

   * Note: Jason's fat farm animal mother was on the loose on the street
           on 3/09/99 and started mooing infront of our bus! haha. 

- (If looks could kill... this Bitch would be the only one left!)
  This song has the melody from Sex&Candy by Marcy Playground:

   Hangin' round, downtown with my buds,
   and I've had so much beer that I thing i'm gonna hurl,
   And then there she waaaas, 
   she threatened to screw up my balls but there she was...
   The Most Revolting Thing on Eaaarrrrtttthhhh;

   I smell Crud and Seaweed, HELP ME!
   Who's that loungin', it's BITCH MASTER T,
   And whos that casting, devious facial expression in my direction,
   Momma this surely is a dream, RIGHT???
   Momma this must be my dream, RIGHT????
   AAAAAAA!!!!


- (No hope for me)
  If you think this song sounds really stupid just by reading the lyrics, 
  wait to you hear it, it is SO much dumber than you think.

  DUN DUN DUN; DUN--- DUN DUN DUN; DUN
  cause i'm ugly, cause i'm ugly, cause i'm ugly (repeated 16 times)
  my nose is too big, my eyes look like barf, cause i'm ugly, cause i'm ugly,
  Cause i'm ugly, I have millions of moles, my mom says they're beauty marks, 
  but THEY'RE MOLES!
  My hailines to high, my ears are too small, my face is dimented, 
  Hours of preperation, and still I look so bad, 
  I may have friends, but the fact remains-- THAT I'M UGLY, THAT I'M UGLY
  ---NO HOPE FOR ME, theres just NO HOPE FOR ME, NO HOPE FOR ME--
  Cause I'm ugly!


- (Your Mom is Gay!)
  Wake up George, your mom is Gay.
                                  
  Travelling to the house of wreckage and... clod,
  I realize something... something very odd,
  Going by her room one rainy Day,
  I didn't really know what to Say...

  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!
  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!
  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!
  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!

  Venturing through a sea of fungus and... weed,
  It seems as though a bath is what you need,
  Out in the distance, i see something Gray,
  A great giant Beluga... heading my way...
  
  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!
  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!
  YOUR MOM IS - GAY!
  YOUR MOM IS - GAYaayyayyyayyy!

  (Something like Monkey Wrench now)


- (Beautiful Chris Chokan)
  Just what the name says, from the melody of "Beautiful People" by Marilyn 
  Manson. Laugh if you want but everything in this song is true (hahaha, 
  even I'm laughing). Note that the video for this song starts off with
  a dark waterfall and rock scenery and sprites like The Beast, Mike the 
  Guard (dying over and over), and Rocket Man Al simultaneoulsy appear 
  after each beat then Chris Chokan appears (Real Me) in the middle singing 
  and keepin' that funky dance. (I'll be disappearing on and off.)

  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME,  (sim1)
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME,  (sim2)
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME,  (sim3)
  THE BEAUTIFUL ME! THE BEAUTIFUL ME!!!! (drumroll)

  Hey, you! What do you say? Something beautiful has My name,
  Hey, you! Are you walkin' away? Well I guess you just have real bad taste,

  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME,
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME,
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME,
  THE BEAUTIFUL ME! THE BEAUTIFUL ME!!!! (drumroll)

  Hey, you! Ya look real gay, I think that surely I'll be stayin' away,
  Hey, you! Did I hear a MOO! You look like one so it must be true.

  There no time to deFuckenate, every motherbeeper that is in your way,

  Hey....
  Hey.... i'm beautiful (Girls talking sexy in bground)
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME, (Guitar 1 and 2 up)
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME, (down)
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME, ""
  The Beautiful ME, The Beautiful ME. (drum smash to end it)

- (She's got me hooked)
  This song is based off the song "She's got Issues" by Offspring. I can
  even play the guitar and drums to this song (Wow! Ahhhhh!). * Not Done

  I'm seeing this girl but she's just nnoott seeing me,
  I shot a basketball at her head just to get her to notice me,
  She talks about the "hunky guys" on that stupid football team,
  And I'd really Like to join but I'd also like to screammm out...

  YEAH HA! YEEEEAH HA, Oh man you're the hottest thing on two legs,
  YEAH HA! YEEAH HAAA, If I scored with you that would be the day,
                                            

  I told her a hundred times it's my parents fault I'm ugly,


  If you don't think I'm sexy,
  Than you must really have bad taste in men,


  I'll be your slave,
  Be your lover, cook and more,
  Just do me a favor,
  And let me in the door (give me the key to your door).


- (Butt my World!)
  The sexiest competition since Mr. Universe is about to become public.

- (No More Hollywood)
  I was going to play this in an Air Band competition on electric and vocals
  but something told me later that that would be stupid. This song changed my 
  mark from 37% to 51% in English class.. kickass.

  Alright, here's a little story, about me,
  True story actually, and just to make things interesting, it rhymes...

  Girls calling me night and day,
  For my muscles that stretch so far away,
  Pumping Iron, every day,
  I had time, to do, whatever I may,
  The days sipped by like Lemonade,
  Reality sweet, life was made,
  Soon, Hollywood would come my way,
  My plans were to have girls, cash and fame;
  But umm... There was just one problem....

  I'm screwed in English Class,
  I'm really screwed in English Class,
  My hopes and dreams will never last,
  Cause I'll be paying my bills from in a shack; yeah...

  I'm screwed in English Class,
  I'm definately screwed in English Class,
  Be poorer than the guy that begs for cash,
  Delivering papers till I'm old and black,

  No more TV, Except TLC,
  No more Simpsons, No hope for me,
  Just misery, in Prison for free,
  Forever Grounded, cauuuussssseeeee

  I'm screwed in English Class,
  I'm really screwed in English Class,
  My 30th credit won't be a pass,
  So I'll see you again in next years class,

  I'm screwed in English Class,
  I'm really screwed in English Class,
  The mother will shoot me out so fast,
  I'll probably end up living in some Trash;

   ...see you my friend, I'm off to pack my bags...

- (Her Role)
  This song has an insanely fast and electric "King of the Hill" beat. It
  was made after I did something really smart, trying to kick the lousy front
  brake of my awesome $30 bike while it was moving and I immediately went
  airborne, bashing my head into the lovely pavement. Now both brakes don't
  work. Most girls I gave this to (about 20 in the release day) told me the
  song was "awesome" and "funny". Then I had to ask the question, "did you
  understand the words?"; and they said "no". The lyrics are going by so
  quickly that it's hard to catch them off guard. And boy did their opinion of 
  the song change once they SAW the words. There's nothing more entertaining
  than a girl getting pissed and thinking your the worst excuse for a person
  put on this earth. Especially since I made this song as pure joke. Those
  women should know their damn role and get back in the kitchen. hahaha

  I don't think your breasts are even close to normal size,
  Slutty, skanky, bitchy; you're flat as a wall, missing something, *BRAIN
  Maybe it's time your slave driving mind should realize,
  I don't want to do this crap -- it's too much work for me, *FIEWW

  Mop, do the dishes, clean my clothes,
  Get rid of those fuckin' panty hoes,
  It's time to relax, sit back, let the women do the household chores, *YEAH

  When I say I love you it just means "get back to worrrrk!",
  Don't you know it's my job to, watch tv, sleep with other women,
  After I bash your head in 20 times you'll finally see,
  I don't need to do this crap -- takes too much brains for... me.

  This is about Pour, our E.T.P. member that lives in the country. The only
  reason I made it is because James gave me a wav file of him playing Yankee
  Doodle on guitar which was really cool.

  Cowboy Jimi milked the cows, riding on his monkey,
  Fed the chickens, zipped his pants, and said "OW.. Motherfucky";
  Went to Levis with a hoe, and killed the general manager,
  Lost his fingers to a goat, than couldn't drive the tractor.

  Jimi cracked eggs, and nobody cared,
  Jimi cracked rocks, and had awful hair,
  Jimi cracked his nuts, on a bull, in a dare,
  And the Doctor's gone away; *AWW ****

  Old Sap Jimi had a farm, A-B-C-D-E
  And on his farm, he had lots of manure, NO-MORE-E-T-P
  With a OH GOD here and a THAT SMELLS there, 
  Here a PTH, there PTH, everywhere a shit pile;
  Old Sap Jimi had a farm, E--I... E---I...  Oohhhhhh....
  woo yeah *applause* "pearl jam or metallica





BEST times
------------
Those are the times Chris Chokan
achived on the hardest skill level without
saving or loading his game throughout the level on his Pentium 100mhz. If
you can better any of his times (while following the same rules); then you
either have a really fast computer, or are a VERY good Speed-deamon.

   Now, I have an old fable to tell you, which your parents might
   have read to you when you were a kid: "Purple Monkey Dishwasher"


RACING THE CLOCK
===================
  If you just LOVE to race down levels as fast as you can trying to get the
fastest time, this is definately for you. As you might have already noticed,
once you beat a level there will be a BEST time written on your ratio chart,
but the best time is not necessarily the time you have to beat to some "XTRA
POINTS"; the best time is Chris's best time for the level on Mama's Boy. The
real time you have to achieve to get XTRA Points is a little more complicating
because; first of all, you don't know what the time you have to beat IS, until
you beat it. Yeah, that's right, it's like a giant math competition, they only
tell you your mark if you made it into the finals.

These "invisable times" is where the real challenge lies. Although the "Best"
times are extremely difficult to beat (or even come close to), the "invisable
times" are an even greater threat. They are the fastest times known to man
on the "I am Chris Chokan" skill level, accomplished by the crazy speed-deamon
that created the game. You can always take the easy route and try and beat the
"invisable times" from an easier skill level (to find out what the hidden time
actually is), but if you are a TRUE racer that is up for the real deal in
challenge, you'll try it on the hardest skill level following these rules (the
same rules that Chris used on his 486/100mhz while racing these levels):

- Mission 1: You have to get 100% on all your ratios before beating the level
- Mission 2: You have to get at least 50% kill ratio before beating the level
- Mission 3: No extra rules applied (the levels are already hard enough alone)
- No loading or saving your game during any part of the level
- Only using the Keyboard (why would you want to use anything else anyways?)

Woohh, don't tell me that you're quitting already? Guess you weren't as brave
and determined as I thought... but if you ARE up to that challenge, that will
make Chris REALLY proud of you, it's not everyday that someone attempts a
challenge like this; and the amount of effort and times you try will already
give yourself the satisfaction that you're a winner even if you don't
beat the records achieved by that crazy lunitic right? But with a lot of
practice, you may come close, and if you actually beat one (or god, maybe even
more) of the "I am Chris Chokan" times using these rules against the CREATOR
HIMSELF, you deserve an AWARD you Roadrunning Speed-Crazed Maniac.


RECORDS
---------

   I just love trying to race down levels trying to get the best times. Here's
some records I've gotten without the help of those massive cheats and without 
saving or loading my game at anytime during the RACE, see if you can do better
(Easy means on "Can I play Daddy" and hard means "I am Death Incarnate"):

Wolfenstein 3D:
Episode 2 (Easy): 4:53  (Awesome with Corridor 7 Music!)
Episode 3 (Bring): 4:46
Episode 5 (Easy):  8:05
Episode 6 (Easy): 13:44


TIME FOR PLAY
================
If you weren't satisfied with all the other bizarre things you can do in
Chokage, here's MORE fun games to play; and compete with your friends! The
results will probably vary from computer to computer. And this is the last
round of zappers before the undoubtful end, so---- Have fun...

-  After being transported to the Black Sunshine event, find out how many
   times you can shoot the poles in a row without electrifying the dogs in
   the time that that it takes for one dog to do a full circle.

-  Venture into the enormous amonut of captive quarters of Converging Halls 
   and see how many doors you can open at once (before the first door closes
   fully). Test yourself an easier level like Beginners Q. before commencing.

-  Race against Chris Chokan's best times (achived on the hardest skill level
   without saving or loading his game throughout the level on his Pentium
   100mhz) and if you're really good, using the same conditions.

-  Lure some pesky little enemies that drop water into the "beyond keys"
   section of the bright red "Tomato Corridor" of the CRASH; kill them in
   that region, and attempt to create (and count) as many cloaked water
   puddles as you can before the CRASH occurs!

-  Trap the dogs into a room?

-  Describe the meaning of Black Sunshine and why the Self-Inducing Barrier
   was a good name for the level it holds. hah, ummm, I dunno.

After playing and competing in these weird games, and only after (unless
you're someone that likes to do the exact opposite of what people tell them
to, in that case, do this right away), you can compare your results with
the ones achieved by that weirdo that thought of these games in the first
place. So, here's Chokan's Ability...

(remember, no peeking until after) 16 with lazer-tongue, 29 after getting
Supersoaker; 14 doors at once; posted on Ratio Charts; all of the enemies;

How to screw up Chokage even more ---> new: Ending music, Level 3-8 Par,
                                       I'll make more new ways soon.

APOLOGIES
==========
              ^^^Some bad things I am sorry for are...^^^

Maybe I went a little too far this time around with the crazyness involved in
this game, maybe you're mind will blow up and you'll sue me... but cRaZy is
funny, & funny is gOoD; isn't that right? As someone with the first name Chris
and last name Chokan used to say: "Life is a joke, laugh it up; hahahaha". If
you'd really rather do without all this PsychoFanaticStupidUnrealisticness,
go outside and play nature walk with all your friends; better yet, play that
awesome Wolfenstein 3D game that started this whole thing... or Conflicts
of the Fatherland, wow that add-on is even MORE real than the original itself.

Sorry about all the bugs in ID Software's engine, I'd fix them, but isn't it
more interesting having a million ridiculous stories to back it all up? Like:

  "Well sir, the game freezes and the sounds don't play right because Chokster
and Hitler were getting into a fight about who would play Chokage first and
they destroyed the game cartridge back in Hellenstein; and when mr. Dog tried
to find Chokster's ear to escape the noise, he accidentaly came out of the ear
of your computer and was dragging the bag of Ice he traded with Barney for a
bowl of Beerios; oh, and Chris is pregnant again... any more questions?"

Surprisingly, many of these stories actually have a point to them with a
strange hidden meaning that will probably even fool dat old hag shakespeare.

I think I talked about myself a few times, sorry, I hate talking about myself
and especially hate when I brag, and damn... I'm talking about myself again.

I apologe for apologizing so much and spelling apologize wrong.
