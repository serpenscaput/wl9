In order to run Passage to Hollenteufel at your preferred screen resolution, simply 
run the game from the Windows "Run" dialogue box or the command line and add the 
"--res [width][height]" parameter after PTH.exe.  For instance, to run the game at 
960x600, type "PTH.exe --res 960 600".

I have included a batch file, PTH.bat, set to run Wolf4SDL at 960x600.  If you prefer 
a different resolution, simply edit the batch file to run the game at your preferred 
resolution.  Note that because Wolfenstein 3D was originally displayed in 320x200 
resolution, you will get the best results in Wolf4SDL if you choose a resolution 
that is a multiple of 320x200.

I have personally had the best results with the following resolutions.

960x600
1280x800
1600x1000
1920x1200
