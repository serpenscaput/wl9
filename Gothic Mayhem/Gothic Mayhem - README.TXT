Story:

   The year is 1992.You are Roland Piercing,a college archeologist professor 
who's also a expert on the occult.One day,you recieved a map from an old
friend revealing the location of a powerful artifact known only as the Skull
of Hell.Legend has it that if the power of this artifact was ever unleashed, 
then the gates of hell would be unlocked and Satan would send his 4 most
trusted minions to make him a new kingdom here on Earth.You knew you had to
leave immediately.

   A couple days later,you finally entered a old church of the long forgotten
gothic city of Chivaz,the city which housed the Skull of Hell.You rested for
several minutes to gather your breath from the long journey,but you're not the
only human in the city.There's also a devil worshipping cult that wants the 
4 minions to create Satan's kingdom,and they just used The Skull's power.A red
bolt of lightning crashed acrossed the sky and a loud demonic laugh followed 
the thunder's echo,you realise that it's too late,and now you have to destroy
the Skull of Hell and any thing that get's in your way.
