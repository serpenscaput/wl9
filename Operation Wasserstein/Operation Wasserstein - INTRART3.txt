^c00 Oberfuhrer Wilhelm Metz, commander of the SS at Castle Schwangau, is dead. Now 
nothing stands between you and Wasser. Make your way through the labyrinthine audience 
halls and reception areas to the Reichsmarschall's office. Only once he's dead, will 
you be able to get to the bottom of Wasserstein and destroy the Ubermensche.
