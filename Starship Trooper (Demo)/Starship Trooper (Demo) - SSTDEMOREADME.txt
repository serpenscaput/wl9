Other works:I have two realesed Half-Life map packs "halflife:xen" and "Black bag 
Ops"
Time of work on this:A couple weeks of doing the art for the bugs... about 35 minutes 
on the map.
Story:(right now the story is not in the map ;) )
Pretty much your platoon was ambushed on Tango Urilla. A Bug planet that had been 
retaken by earth forces. 
But it appears the bugs managed to hold on. So your mission is to escape the planet 
while you kill a whole lotta bugs
You'll visit some of the places seen in the movie,the fort,Hopper canyon, YOu will 
even see plasma bugs off in the distances.

The map:
The demo map is small just big enough to leave you unsatisfied (as a demo should) 
YOu'll get to kill about say...35 bugs or 
so. You get a knife A morita assuallt rifle and you will have to find the chaingun. 

(the knife and chaingun do not have new art yet!) 

The bugs (or Arachnids hehe)
You will be dealing with the standard foe of the full game. Arachnid warriors arm 
with very sharp pincer like mouths 
and two hmm well there like its arms but they end in a spike so watch out hehe It 
will take about 20 rounds from your morita 
to put one down so just keep shooting (AND SEACRH FOR THE AMMO!)

Please send me feedback on what you'd like to see and if you can help me! Or just 
send me an email telling me 
how good/crappy it was. :)Thealienfan@hotmail.com
