--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIAL:
 INCASE YOU WERE WONDERING ABOUT THAT MIDI
FILE IN THIS ZIP I'LL TELL YOU.
DURING THE MAKING OF THE ORIGINAL WOLF3D,
THAT WAS INTENDENT FOR THE GAME BUT BECAUSE
OF COMPUTER SOUND TECHNOLOGY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO PLAY ALTHOUGH IT MADE IT INTO DOOM.
 SO HERE IS THE MIDI VESION OF IT. I SUGGEST
YOU TURN OF THE GAME MUSIC AND HAVE THE MIDI
PLAY IN THE BACKGROUND.
---------------------------
UPCOMING PROJECTS:

YEP THATS RIGHT I'M WORKING ON NEW PROJECTS.
LOOK FOR THESE UPCOMING RELEASES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS. THE COMMIES ARE INVADING 
AND NOW YOU GOT TO BLOW THEM
 ALL AWAY. YOU'LL BE BATTLING

TO  COMMIES IN BIG RED ARMOR!
