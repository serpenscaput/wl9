^C01 re: Additional security guards

^C04 I sent an email to administration saying that we need some more security guards in this lab, because there are no security guards in this particular area and not enough in the cell block. Today I got a reply from administration and they said the necessary funds weren’t available. That's absolutely ridiculous! They just want to scrimp on money and they don't give a flying toss about us.
