^C01 re: Experiments for Beta Labs Sector 4

^C04 The Beta Labs Sector 4 team asked us to help them out once again, because they don't have enough research equipment to perfect their newest invention. They're working on a new type of Endoskeleton which will be more efficient. Our job was to find a way that let the skeleton control a weapon with its "mind". It wasn't too easy to find a way, but we did and we're quite proud to be credited with this advance.
