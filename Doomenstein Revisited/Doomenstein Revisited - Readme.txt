Doomenstein Revisited
A wolf3d add-on with Doom graphics by Joe M

Hi Thanks for downloading this add-on for Wolf3d
It contains doom graphics and sounds
Also has 20 new levels
To play it you will need the full version of the Original Wolf3d
I would like to give credit to the add-ons i borrowed content from

Evil in Iron Special Doom Version by John Bucksnort
Wolfendoom by AreYep
Doomenstein demo by Bruce Ryder
And also thanks to ID Software for creating Wolfenstein 3d and Doom

It also contains some doom graphics I extracted from Doom I and II
I hope you enjoy playing it
