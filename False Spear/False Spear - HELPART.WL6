^C65"No time for peppy chit chat...

from agent Bryson, 
^C65 we have a reason to suspect that the nazis got him." ^C00 A man with a filefolder

with nervous look on his face... 
^C65 "Listen carefully William... This is very important, for last few months Mr.

^C00 McMire sits back to his chair. 
^C65 "How familiar are you with Dr. Schabbs or his work?"
^C95 "He is the big bald guy, one of Hitlers top scientists... Wasn't he experimenting 
with humans?"
^C65 "Yes, you're correct... again... We have a reason to believe that Dr. Schabbs 
has manage to create some sort of destructive weapon and that was the target of Mr. 
Bryson"
