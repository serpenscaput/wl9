Story: On the planet "Eat at Joe's" there lived a race of take-away fast food. Burgers, 
hot dogs and large soda cups lived
together working hard to bring miniturised little edible versions of themselves to 
the universe. However, one burger had
accidentaly crashed the catering space-truck he was driving and spilled 2 tons of 
fast food into space. The evil Soda Cup
commission ordered that the burger's bun, vegetables, sauce and spices be ripped 
off his body, a very painful and
irreversable punishment. The burger, now a grubby patty was exiled. The burger gathered 
his miniture ketchup pistol and
took up his father's stick (crabbe au stick, mind you). He decided to get revenge 
by killing the Soda Cup commander.
