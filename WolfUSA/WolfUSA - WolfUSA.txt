WolfUSA Version 2 - by Fred Kenny 

Thank you for downloading this add-on for Wolfenstein 3D. The full version of the 
game is needed to play.

This zip file contains GAMEMAPS.WL6, MAPHEAD.WL6, VSWAP.WL6 and WOLFUSA.TXT. Please 
do not distribute this set with any other files added.

The wall designs are all red, white and blue. There's a lot more variation though 
than in the original version of WolfUSA.

The maps are from Fred's earlier set WOLFFRED which had 10 new levels on episode 
three, started by Fred Kenny and completed by Brian Lowe. Some later normal levels 
had bosses, usually Hans Grosse. All the other episodes were included because they 
were all changed in some way by Fred Kenny. 

The actors are now the original ones. This is to fit in with the following storyline... 


"In this one the TERRORISTS have disguised themselves as WWII German soldiers. 
To mock the good ole U S A they painted the walls with the colors of the American 
flag."

Thanks go to those at id software for producing such a great game and without which 
this add-on would not be possible.
