Map of the Month Club Contest - SDL Version

You can make 1 or 2 maps per month for submittal to the contest, and each month all 
the maps collected will be released as a package that anyone can play, and the members 
of the forums can vote on.  The winners generally receive a graphic plaquard (signature 
graphic) that they can display in the forums or saved for your own posterity.  I 
know it's just a graphic, but hey, it's all in fun and that's it really.  We hope 
that in participating that it will help you with your mapping skills and allows you 
to try and do things that you normally wouldn't do in a map for your own project. 
 It gives you the chance to take chances, and if others really like what you've done, 
it could add other options to your own mapping ideas.  

Anyhow..  Here's how you control the game from within your own map.
First, give your map a name (or when you are done) but give it a name so that way 
when 
the others play it they can play it with you keeping annonymity.  Noone needs to 
know 
(other than that months co-ordinator) who created what map.  So if it really bombs, 
you 
don't have to say, yeah that was mine.  The co-ordinators only post the names of 
the 
creators of the top 3 maps.  Although, you can (after the voting period is over) 
step up and let everyone know which map was yours.  

Next, you have to make your map with 1 limitation - That is that the top row of the 
map is used for controlling the features you want for your map.  You set the atmosphere. 
 You can have up to 700 static objects on the map, 250 enemies or actors, and of 
that 250 will be displayable on the screen at any one time.  Hopefully that will 
allow you plenty of options to really decorate your map and make it have the atmosphere 
that you are looking for. Now back to the top row of the map... You control the games 
features by placing wall tiles in specific spots on the map to enable or disable 
things.

[2,0] = Floor Colour for your Map
[3,0] = Starry Sky Toggle (0 = Off 1 = Starry Sky 2=CloudySky) 
[4,0] = Moon Colour (only if 3,0 is enabled) 1=White, 2=Red, 3=Blue

[6,0] = Shading Off (1=Turn Off shading, 0 or anything else turns shading on) 
[7,0] = Crosshair Off (1=Turn Off crosshair, 0 or anything else turns crosshair on) 



BLOCKING TILES: 
Coordinates [15,0] to [26,0] determine which enemies can cross a blocking tile object. 

A value  of "0" = Not able to cross; “1+” = they CAN cross. 

[15,0] = Dogs Cross	[16,0] = Guards Cross
[17,0] = SS Cross	[18,0] = Officer Cross
[19,0] = Mutant Cross	[20,0] = Hans Cross
[21,0] = Gretel Cross	[22,0] = Gift Cross
[23,0] = Fat Cross	[24,0] = Schabbs Cross
[25,0] = Mecha Hitler Cross	[26,0] = Real Hitler Cross

LOCKED DOOR SETTINGS: 
You can now tell who can open the locked door by minimum enemy type... e.g.: if you 
don't 
want Guards or SS to open those doors, but you want the Officers or better to use 
the door... 
then you put the proper wall value on that coordinate... 

[27,0] = Gold/Yellow Locked Doors	[28,0] = Silver/Blue Locked Doors
[29,0] = White Locked Doors	[30,0] = Red Locked Doors

The values are: 
0 = All can open,            1 = Guard can open,        2 = SS can open,         
  3 = Officer can open, 
4 = Mutant can open,    5 = Hans can open,         6 = Gretel can open,      7 = 
Gift can open, 
8 = FatFace can open,   9 = Schabbs can open, 10 = MechaHitler, and  11 = Real Hitler 
can open, 
12 = No one  can open
NOTE: Ghosts and Dogs can't open doors so there is no setting for them.

HEALTH ITEM SETTINGS:
The wall value placed on these spots equals the amount of health or healing points 
that the player will
receive when they pick the item up.  
[31][0] First Aid Kit Value	[32][0] Food Plate Value 
[33][0] Dog Food Value	[34][0] Gibs Value




AMMO/WEAPON SETTINGS: 
The value of the walls placed on these locations will give the player that amount 
of ammo when they
pick up that item.
[35][0] AmmoBox Value	[36][0] Full Clip Value
[37][0] Used Clip Value	[38][0] Ammo for Weapon Pickup

ENEMY HEALTH SETTINGS:
Yes, you read that right.  You can set it so that when an enemy is hit, if they walk 
across a health item,
they can pick it up to repair their health points.  They will not pick up health 
points until their health is
less than 40% to 50% of their original full health.  
[39][0] - 0 = Enemies can't pick up Health; 1+ = They can pick up Health if needed





BONUS ITEM SETTINGS (Wall value times 100):
These spots help you decide how many points the player will get for picking up each 
one of these
treasures.  You can play with these to make it so that a player might be better off 
to find everything on
your map to get full points or you can make these lower and have them race for speed 
to beat the par 
time and get a higher bonus score.
[40][0] 1Up Bonus Points	[41][0] Cross Value  (Wall 1 = 100 points)
[42][0] Chalice (Wall 5 = 500points)	[43][0] Chest/Bible (Wall 10 = 1000points)
[44][0] Crown (Wall 50 = 5000points)	

Controlling Weapon Jamming:
[50][0] 0 = Disable Weapon Jam; 1 = Enable Weapon Jam 
[51][0] if Weapon Jam Enabled 0 = Weapon Jam Only; 1 = Loose Weapon on Jam

Things the Enemies Drop:
[48][0] = 0 Guards Drop Ammo; 1+ Guards drop Pistol... 
[49][0] = 0 SS Drops Ammo; 1+ SS drops the Machinegun...

WHAT THE BOSSES DROP:  
[54,0] = Hans Drop Value	[55,0] = Gretel Drop Value
[56,0] = Giftmacher Drop Value	[57,0] = Fatface Drop Value
[58,0] = Schabbs Drop Value	[59,0] = Mecha Hitler Drop Value
[60,0] = Real Hitler Drop Value	

Drop Values 
0= drop nothing?, 
1=Gold key, 
2=Silver key,
3=White key, 
4=Red key, 
5=Master key, 
6=1up?

OTHER VARIABLES: 
[61,0] = Starting Weapon (0 = Player will start with Knife, anything else = pistol 
start) 
[62,0] = Par time Minutes (1 = 1 min, 2 = 2 min, etc) 
[63,0] = Par time Seconds (0 = 0 secs, 1 = 15secs, 2 = 30secs, 3 = 45secs) 











THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MAP VARIABLES:
[0,1] = Red Shading Level 
[0,2] = Green Shading Level 
[0,3] = Blue Shading Level 
[0,4] = Fog Level (0 = No fog, 1 = fog on) 
The Red, Green, Blue Levels can be adjusted using wall values just as you can for 

the other game settings. Rippers Normal shading examples had the following 
values: Red = Green = Blue in all the settings 
And he used 3 different values for those settings... 0, 10, & 15. Now you can play

with them, as you like to get the specific look that you want. One thing to remember 

though is that depending on the age and type of your monitor, or the other people 

playing your map, the colours that you see may be different to someone else’s 
machine. So play with them carefully. Additionally, the fog level is adjustable, 
in Ripper's original settings a value of 5 was considered fog, values over 20 are 
extremely foggy.
[0,5] = Crosshair Colour (again using palette values - 0 to 15 are usual values, 
but you can 
            use any colour from the wolfenstein palette) 
[0,6] = In-Game Messages Shadow Colour (background)
[0,7] = In-Game Messages Main Colour (foreground)
[0,8] = Shading Cutoff Value
	This determines the strength of the shading with respect to the furthest shade. 
	A value of 0 will make the furthest shade exactly the colour specified above, a

	value of 8 is the default setting, and higher values will make the shading less

	pronounced overall. You can use this in combination with the fog value to
	to create a very dark or foggy environment (although be aware lights, etc. will 
	show through the fog).

THIS IS FOR MOD PURPOSES ONLY - If you wish to use this exe as the base for 
your own game, you can use the following mapspot to tell the game not to reset the 
players
values when they start each new level.  To avoid this happening, Just place A Blank 
or 
Undefined (0) walltile on mapspot [63][63] = no reset between levels. Also setting 
this to 
0 will disable the TAB-W warp command.  They will have to cheat to warp.
