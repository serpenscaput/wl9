Thanks for downloading MegaWolf 3-D, a real cool change to your Wolf3D 1.4!
This is FREEWARE, and was NOT created by Apogee/Id Software! This software
can't be sold by any type of vendor, yet can be freely uploaded to any BBS!
Thank you for your cooperation. (yeah right!)

∞±≤€ TO INSTALL MEGAWOLF €≤±∞

Just unzip a crisp version of Wolf 1.4 into a directory, then overwrite the
old 1.4 .WL1 files with the included .WL1 files! Simple!

6/26/97 - NASA cruiser is successfully launched into space to discover the
          atmospheric change of Saturn. Scientists believe it might be possible
          to begin life there.

7/13/97 - Cruiser's communications are on the blink. No response. Our team
          is scanning our equipment for damages.

7/21/97 - No damages found. NASA believes cruiser lost the 1 out of millions
          of communication frequencies. Planning to send a secondary cruiser
          to find it.

Here's when the FBI came in. They got a hunch that NASA had more up their sleeves

than just Saturn. So, B.J. goes for his 3rd metal of kick butt action, as he
goes undercover as a crewman of the next cruiser launch.

After a month or so on the voyage, B.J. finds out that the course was way off
from where the last cruiser 'got off the exit'! From that night on B.J. keeps
a gun under his pillow!

A few days later, the huge cruiser landed on a HUGE ship, about 20 times bigger
than any NASA cruiser known to time! As B.J. got out, the ship abandoned him on
the ship, and drifted out to space. Staring quite STUPIDLY, you know something
is going on. With no way to get back to land just yet, you go searching out
beyond the docking bays...

∞±≤€ 10 LEVELS OF HELL €≤±∞

If the mazes don't get you, the security will! The security is tight, and will
open fire at anything! Watch yourself, you might be caught by surprise!

There's also some experimental tubes along with god knows what else that'll
get ya, so be careful for anything that talks, slithers, or blurps!

∞±≤€ CONTINUES €≤±∞

After a few levels, the HUGE ship you're on lands on something even larger...
AN ALIEN PLANET!! Now you get off, and hello monsters! Watch where you wander!

∞±≤€ ! €≤±∞

A VERY BIG WARNING : Using special cheat modes such as M,L,I or GOOBERS may
cause something very bad to happen, possibly the most dangerous monster of any
game ... DOS PROMPT! Be careful, and know where, and where not you're supposed
to go!

Also, in Level 2, you are getting close to the alien planet. The only possible
way into the ship is inside of the shuttle launchers (better known as the RED
ZONE. ). If you fire within these areas, something really wierd'll happen.
(Actually, if you like being scared sh*tless, it's kinda cool!)

A final warning to take seriously : DON'T SHOOT OUTSIDE FROM THE SHUTTLE
LAUNCHERS! If you do, you're gonna pay the hard way! (Unless you're quick!)

∞±≤€ USA RULES! €≤±∞

That's right, MegaWolf was made in the . . .

Well, we might as well tell you what happens with NASA, since the ending of
Wolf 1.4 can't be changed...<sigh> We'll just have to trust you already
finished (or at least tried!) MegaWolf. Here's hoping!





























Ok...<GULP!>







































Oh geeze!







































MmMmMmMmMmMmMmMmMmMmMm...







































Ok ok!



After the destruction of the alien core, the ship flew off (with you on it),
and the alien planet blew up. The crew was back on the ship, and everything
went fine during the voyage back to earth.

NASA explained to the FBI that the dissapearance of the ship was just a big
trick. It actually flew to the alien planet to collect more samples, but
the entire crew, in time,  were killed by the monsters.

So, NASA asked the FBI to send somebody out there to clean house. And, of
course, they selected a man of fine performance, B.J.!

They didn't expect the planet to explode, so the trips were wprthless, except
for the samples in the new lab in Antarctica. They will proceed with further
studies with what they got from the planet before it gone to pieces.

That's it! Then you live happily ever after, until. . .

2/06/99 - A major explosion has come up at the experimental lab!

To be continued!!

∞±≤€ HINTS €≤±∞

There are many 1-up's in the ship. Look all over the place!

Most of the elevators you see are broken. They have a red arrow pointing up.

The colors of the boxes on the floor are points! White is a 1-up!

It's fun to try to get through the entire game! Try it!

Save your game alot! It's fun! It wastes your space! Fun, eh?

∞±≤€ CREDITS €≤±∞

Thank you VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY much to Apogee/Id!

And here's the introduction to that "mystery company", right? Well, sort of.
We're just 2 friendly cousins that when Wolf3d came out, we HAD to make our
own. And now, our game speaks louder than how much work we've put into these
graphics. Pretty neat, eh?

MegaWolf was supposed to be out by Feb. 17, but when we tried our very own
work (very heart-warming experience!), it was missing alot of action. So, we
added some more bad-dudes to it, and it worked out pretty well! Now you got
it, so stop entering messages on BBSes saying "Where is it???", ok?

∞±≤€ FINIS €≤±∞

That's it! Now get out there, and kick some alien butt!

Happy hunting from us, the 2 cousins!

P.S. : A little info on how long it took us to complete this darn thing!

 Months : approx. 4
  Weeks : approx. 17
   Days : approx. 119
  Hours : approx. 2,856
Minutes : approx. 171,360
Seconds : approx. 10,281,600

Cool, eh?
