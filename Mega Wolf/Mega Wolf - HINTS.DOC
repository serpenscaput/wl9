MegaWolf 3-D Hint File - Log for every level

--------------------------------------------

We know how hard this game gets during the later games. You know why it's so
hard? THERE'S ALMOST NO HEALTH RECOVERY!! HA HA HA!

BUT, if you know what you're doing, you'll keep your cool in one piece!
Carefully examine the following level logs to help you understand more of
the level, so you can get the most help out of em!

Level 1 - Docking Bays

You find yourself staring into space. Stop it! The big trick to this level
is to know which security is 'active', and which are just hanging around.
You must take heed through the hallways. If you try to pass an active
security, you're in for it! Try to get rid of it while it's vunerable!

Level 2 - Center Deck 28

On the deck, there's a nice view of space, and then there's a science lab
with experimental tubes as big as you, and green globs moving toward you.
GET EM! They're not very friendly! Get the key in the locker room, and go
into the RED ZONE. DON'T SHOOT OUT THE SHUTTLE INTO NOWHERE! Find your way
through the long crossways between the thrusters and into the experimental
room with yes, more blobs. Waste em, and get the key. You can now reach the
elevator, which is a little south from where you first arrived!

Level 3 - Dark Sewers

Here's a real complex maze of dark proportions. Watch your back, for there's
a few more blobs than usual. Get the two keys and use the switch to turn on
the lights to the rest of the maze! (Actually, the light switch IS the
elevator!)

Level 4 - 2nd part of the MAZE!

The same floor, but now you can get by that mysterious force that kept you
from bypassing the switch! Neat, eh? Now comes the part when the paths begin
to split into two for almost the WHOLE MAZE! Don't use a coin toss, use your
brain! There's a catch! If you go the wrong way, a blob'll try to getcha!
Then, when you attack, it alarms everybody else, and you're REALLY in for
it! Here's one hint to get you both keys : KEEP TURNING LEFT! DON'T PASS ONE
TRAIL WITHOUT TURNING LEFT! That should get you there, unless you don't know
your left from your right!

Level 5 - Aaahh! Fresh air!

Hooray! You're outta there! Hey, but what's this? You've landed on an alien
planet SWARMING with blobs! Aaarrrggghh! The elevator to the underground is
hiding, and there's blobs all over the place! Run into the entrance to the
cave, and make a sharp right into a looks-like vacant room. There's a little
'crack' in this room, where it'll take you to the elevator outta here!

Level 6 - Laval Cave

Well, as you move along, you see a small ship stranded underground, and more
blobs...DON'T SHOOT THEM! If you do, here comes the welcoming comitte! Also,
DON'T OPEN THE DOOR TO THE SHIP! If you do, you might not like it! Just go
down the dark path, find your way through the walls via secret door, and
LEAVE! That's it!

Level 7 - The Demon's Realm

Here's where it all comes to! This is truly an evil place, and are filled
with demonic skulls that will surely conquer you! SAVE YOUR GAME HERE BEFORE
EVEN BLINKING! If you try to walk through the front skull, it turns real!
Shoot him down, get the ammo, and walk into the 3-way room.Shoot through the
left room to get the hiding skull.

You could say there are 3 challanges (kinda like Indiana Jones, eh?!) to get
by. This one is pretty tricky. You can't see where you're going! Bumping
into the air, you must get to the key at the far side of this hall! Have
fun!

Skip the middle challenge, for that requires both keys. The second key's
within the rightward room. Shoot through this room too. Another hiding skull
will get you if you don't! This place is called the "Room Of Curiosity"
because people often like to check for secret doors. NOT a good idea! Also,
stay very straight walking toward the key. As you try to get the key, there's
3 skulls in front of you. Blast em', get the key, and run STRAIGHTLY back
so all the 'others' don't wake up!

Then you're ready for the last challenge...or you think! As you unlock the
last door, you are welcomed by HEALTH and AMMO! YES! Then, after you're done
vieweing your status, there lies the last door. Be ready for what lies just
ahead! CHARGE IT! Run through this hall with your 6-barrel (We hope!)
BLAZING! Use all your ammo now, because there's plenty more later!

If you survive all that, good job! You deserve the metal, but it ain't over!
There's the elevator, but save your game first!

Level 8 - Alien Tunnels

Don't worry...Level 7 is the smallest nightmare you'll have on this journey!
Now, here comes when it looks like it's straight from an Alien (TM) movie!
Actually, the idea of the walls were from the movie! It's actually hard to
know which way you're going in these tunnels.

Enough about it's looks! The only trick that'll help you here is not to jump
the gun...LEAP! As you enter most of these caverns, quickly spin around and
blow away the skulls hiding around the door! If not, they'll get the leap
on you! It's a pretty much straight path, so there's no need for directions!
(unless you get forwards and backwards mixed up!)

Level 9 - Run like the WIND

Here's where it's not guts that count, but brains! The only way you'll learn
how to get through this level is either the hard way or by this text!

When you go through the skull, you'll see two are right beside you. RUN!!
You'll have to run fast to avoid their fire while drawing them up to the
end of the corridor! When they get there, they'll open the locked doors.
Quickly shoot the left skull and pick up the key in the room, spin around
to shoot the right skull, and RUN INTO THE RIGHT LOCKED DOOR BEFORE IT
CLOSES!!! If you don't succeed, there's a death room in the center door.
(Have a nice day!)

Run down the corridor where the skull came up, and enter the locked door.
(That's why you needed that key!) When you get in there, all the supplies
you'll need for the very final level are there. Filler up, save your game,
and get ready for the real cool BOSS!

Level 10 - BOSS Room!

You better be ready right when the screen comes up! He...err, it'll be
ready for you, but you won't be! If you run back a couple spaces, you'll see
some big walls along your sides. Use them! This thing can come after you,
and there's no helper items anywhere, so keep away from it, but give it a
burst now and then. It'll take a while, but it's worth it!

After it's gone, the key is yours! Get out of there, and you'll find the
ship! You won  .  .  . or did you? The ending is pretty shocking!
