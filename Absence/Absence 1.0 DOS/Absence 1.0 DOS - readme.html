<h6>A Wolfenstein 3-D Total Conversion</h6>
</div>
<b><u>Setup</u></b><br>
<p>Simply double click ABSENCE.EXE to start the game. It runs just like the original Wolfenstein 3-D. It has been optimised with the aim of providing an enjoyable experience on a variety of computers. By default, all options except "FPS Counter" and "Crosshair" are enabled. If the game performs poorly, try disabling one game option after another until the game runs acceptably on your computer.</p>
<b><u>Sound</u></b><br>
<p>If you've Windows 2000 or XP, the AdLib sound effects and music won't run properly. In order to hear these, you'll need to use <a href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">DOSBox</a> or <a href="http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=2071" target="_blank">VDMSound 2.1 Public Beta</a> (2.0.4 should also work).</p>

<b><u>Story</u></b><br>
<p>The US government has decided to start a secret project for genetic and robotic experiments. For this purpose an underground lab called the "Sigma Complex" was built in the state of New Mexico. One year after the start of the project something terrible happened down there. The connection to the lab complex was lost. No one knows what happened, but someone has to find out! The government decided to send you, an elite soldier, specially trained for army operations like this, into the complex. The first priority of your mission is to find the last known documents about Professor Tom Baker's experiments and then destroy the complex. The second priority is to eliminate all failed lab experiments, and see if anyone (or anything) has survived. You arrive at the access point into the lab complex and enter the elevator that transports you to the entrance hall. You step out of the elevator and hear animal-like growls and computer-like beeps echoing through the distant corridors. They know you're here. There's no turning back now. Time to kick some metal ass!</p>
