^C01 re: Candidate found

^C04 The leading security guard, Doug Johnson, has volunteered to become the first cyborg of the third generation. That not only gives us an eligible candidate, but a strong one as well. His file indicates that his physical and mental fitness matches the selection criteria in every respect for this project. We hope to get him finished in the next 3 months.
