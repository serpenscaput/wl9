^C01 re: Security?!

^C04 The lab experiments are meant to be kept here? Ha, the security here is a big 
joke! Just one bloody shock barrier separates me and the experiments. What if the 
electricity goes offline? Then these creatures might start walking around and.....I 
don't want to even think about it. The administration must be crazy; the security 
level here should be higher.
