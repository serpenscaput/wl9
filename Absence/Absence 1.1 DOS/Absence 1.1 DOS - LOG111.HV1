^C01 re: Doubtful methods

^C04 I never liked the way the shock barriers in this lab operate: someone has to stay in this room and deactivate the shock barriers by flipping this switch. Now what if somebody forgets to flip the switch back to reactivate the barriers? If that happened, all these dangerous creatures could escape. Why is the security in the second highest lab so terrible?!
