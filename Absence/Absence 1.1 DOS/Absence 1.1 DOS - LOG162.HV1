^C01 re: Out of control

^C04 What has got into him? Prof. Baker wants to give the Ubersoldier control of most of the systems in the complex. I don't think that this is a good idea. What if he goes crazy or something like that one day? I don't even want to think about that. I'll talk to Prof. Baker about this plan - he can't be serious.
