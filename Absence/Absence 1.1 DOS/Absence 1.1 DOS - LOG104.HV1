^C01 re: Promotion

^C04 I did it! After almost a year I finally got promoted to lab technician! They said I'm excelling in electrical engineering and they've given me a job in Delta Labs Sector 1. My dream has come true! I can finally prove myself as one of the best robotics technicians and hopefully soon I can work side-by-side with Prof. Baker. This probably won't happen for a while, but for now I'm happy to get this opportunity in the Delta Labs.
