INTRODUCTION:

"Operation: Mutant Strike 2" Prologue/Story


MISSION BRIEFING (from Assistant OSS chief Donald Dickerson):

Welcome back, Agent Hunter...

Sorry to call you back on such short notice, but we have little choice.  This mission is of a critical nature, and have very little time to complete it.

As you may have heard already, one of your fellow OSS members, BJ Blazkowicz, has been kidnapped by terrorists.  We need to get him back as quickly as possible.  The leader of the terrorists, a man known as "The Silver Fox", has contacted us regarding the kidnapping, and has made some demands.

It seems that "The Silver Fox" is the leader and mastermind behind "Regenschirm Corporation", the biological weapons corporation that assisted the Nazis during their "Operation: Mutant Strike".  The Fox himself is of Russian descent, but apparantly he sympathized with the Nazis during WWII, and has been trying to help them get revenge through biological weapons ever since.

To make a long story short, The Silver Fox assumed that BJ was the OSS agent responsible for foiling Muller's plans, and kidnapped him in order to get revenge.  BJ must have told him he had the wrong man, because The Silver Fox is demanding that the real agent behind the Mutant Strike counter strike be turned over to him to be dealt with.

In an effort to perform another counter strike, we're going to give him what he wants, just not the way he wants it.  We're sending you back into action to destroy the Silver Fox and rescue BJ before it's too late.  We've pinpointed the location of "Regenschirm Corporation"... disturbingly enough, its headquarters is on American soil.

The terrorist hideout seems to be a company called "Biotech Corp", located on the Alaskan coast.  The company seems legitimate on the outside, but strange occurances in the vicinity of the facility have lead us to believe it is anything but.  Over the past several months, a strange virus has been killing off locals in nearby settlements, and nearly all of the victims' bodies have vanished without a trace.  Add to that the fact that the broadcasts we've received from the Silver Fox have come from that region, and the facility looks very suspicious.

One thing we found strange about the whole matter...The Silver Fox said that the agent who stopped "Operation: Mutant Strike" had destroyed many of his "biological weapons", and he wanted to know what all you knew about them.  That makes two of us, since your debriefing mentioned only SS soldiers as opposition.  Witholding information about a possible biological weapons threat is a very serious violation of OSS protocol, and will need to be investigated at a later date, but right now, whatever knowledge you have that you gained on your previous mission makes you the most suitable candidate for this mission as well.

We're not sure what sort of opposition you'll face when infiltrating "Biotech Corp".  Intelligence tells us that there seems to be a large force of security officers on the premesis at all times, and we're assuming they're the Fox's terrorists in disguise.  If this is true, they won't hesitate to kill you, so don't be afraid to shoot back.  As for any other opposition you face, we would prefer that you leave some of the Silver Fox's "biological weapons" intact so we can collect them for research later.  Burning all the bodies after your last mission possibly robbed us of some valuable data we could have used against the enemy, and was a very poor decision.

We'll be air dropping you outside the "Biotech Corp" facility a few hours from now, so get your things ready.  The weather this time of year is pretty mild, so your stealth suit should provide sufficient protection from the elements, especially since you won't be spending much time outside.  Once outside the facility, you'll be going right through the front entrance...intelligence tells us it's the only way for a human to enter the facility.  It will be heavily guarded, but we have faith in you.  Once inside, your objectives are the following:


1 - Locate evidence to confirm Biotech is actually the biological weapons company known as "Regenschirm Corporation".

2 - Locate and terminate The Silver Fox with extreme prejudice.

3 - Obtain and preserve evidence of biological weapons to be returned to OSS headquarters for examination.

4 - Locate and rescue BJ Blazkowicz, and help him escape the facility alive.

5 - Escape the facility and contact us for extraction arrangements.


We have very little time before The Silver Fox figures out what we're doing.  It's possible he'll execute BJ if he discovers our operation, so work as quickly as possible.  Once you've returned safely, we will discuss your continued service to the OSS, based on our findings regarding information you witheld from your last mission.  Don't worry about that right now, though...you need to stay focused and complete this mission.  Good luck, Agent Hunter...failure is not an option...



MISSION INFO:

Unlike a lot of the other manuals for our projects, this one will be very brief.  You will have to discover pretty much everything about the game yourself, and from the moment you begin, you're on your own for ten whole levels.  At the end of certain levels, however, you will be rewarded with a bit of the story as it progresses, and, if you encountered any new enemies in the previous levels, you will receive information about these enemies as well.


CHANGES:

There are a few noticeable changes in OMS2, but for the most part, things have been kept as true to the original Wolfenstein formula as possible.  As was the goal with Majik Monkee's "Operation: Lezterschutz", and OMS1, OMS2 is meant to feel like a legitimate progression of the Wolfenstein story.  Here are the changes in the game:

- the rifle (pistol replacement) is almost twice as strong as the pistol is in the original Wolfenstein, making it a useful weapon for dealing with individual enemies, even when you have plenty of ammo.  This was meant to be the case in OMS1 also, but the code wasn't quite in the right place.  Consider the rifle to always be an alternative to the machine gun, especially when facing individual tougher enemies (like scientists in the beginning).

- ammo limit has been set to a max of 250 bullets instead of 99.  This is useful, since you will face a lot of tough enemies, and won't always have time to run around picking up bullets after you start fighting.  Be conservative, though...the chaingun can still go through 250 rounds pretty quickly.

- some of the boss behavior etc has been changed.  The result is that there are several "mini boss" type enemies you may encounter throughout the game, who will drop various items.  The ghosts have been made stationary, and now serve another purpose in the game...

- levels are now seamless.  There are only ten of them, but you don't have to pick which episode you want to play.  This is good, since there are no levels after the first ten...trust me.  Oh...and there is no secret level... sorry, but secrets don't make friends... :)

- shading has been added to the game to create a greater sense of atmosphere.  This was considered for the first game, but never actually implemented.  Be warned that there is a slight pause at the start of shaded levels as the shading table loads, but this is normal.  The first couple levels won't do this, because they are not shaded.

- there are some other changes, but they are classified in nature.  Sorry, but to reveal much more about them would be to spoil some surprises, and where's the fun in that?


GENERAL TIPS:

I'm not going to cover Wolfenstein basics.  If you've never played the original, you really ought to go play it first...at very least, the shareware version.  For those of you who have played the originals, though, you already know the basics, so this will just cover stuff that is a little different in OMS2.  If you've played OMS1 already, you can probably skip this section. Here goes...

- Keep your eyes open for enemies at all times.  You might be staring right at a potential threat and not know it.  You'll see what I mean after the first few minutes of the game (if you played OMS, you probably already know a little what I'm talking about).

- Security is very tight around "Biotech Corp".  Keys are almost never found just lying around. They will almost always be in the care of an enemy you must defeat, so don't run from battles...even the tough ones...nothing would suck more than to have an enemy with a key you really need wander off where you can't find them because you ran away from a fight (certain types of enemies that drop other things will never by carrying keys).

- There are a few different kinds of harmful objects that should be obvious to you.  If you are having trouble passing them without getting hurt, try facing away from them as you pass by.  This will reduce the chance that you get injured, or at very least, reduce the damage you take.

- Expect the unexpected.  That's what this game is about...keeping things a surprise until you come across them.  You may have seen some of the enemies in other games before, but until you come across them, there's always the fear and the excitement of the unknown.  Plus, there's some stuff you've probably never had to fight before to look forward to.

- Don't forget your knife.  It's not a silenced weapon in this game, but in a pinch, it can be used to kill most of the weaker enemies fairly easily, including mutants.  Be warned, though, that this only works on the mutants that lie around until they see you.  The other kind will finish you off quickly in close quarters.

- Keep trying.  This mod is difficult, but by no means impossible.  There is always a way to overcome every obstacle.  If direct confrontation isn't working for you, try something else.  You can do it...it's all worth it to reach the final confrontation... :)


GETTING STARTED:

The difficulty level of this game is a little higher to begin with than that of the original Wolfenstein.  If you've played OMS1, you'll be familiar with some of the tougher enemies near the start, but if you're new to Wolfenstein games, you might find it to be a little difficult.  Here are some more in-depth tips for those of you having trouble getting started (those of you who want things to remain a secret, ignore this section...it might spoil some stuff for you).

1 - Stick with your rifle at the start of the game.  You will get a machine gun very early on, but it's best used when you have a healthy supply of ammo already.  The rifle puts your bullets to much better use, especially at close range.

2 - It's best to draw enemies out of the room they are in and force them to come through the door into your room so you can pick them off easily where you have the advantage.  At the beginning of the game, there is a spot where shooting a certain security guard will trigger a horde of other guards to come running into your area.  Stay alert!

3 - While it's wise to eliminate as many enemies as you can, there are some that may be smarter to avoid early on.  The scientists can be challenging to defeat sometimes, but the medkits they drop can be invaluable, so consider waiting to fight them until you need a health boost (unless they are blocking your path).

4 - Be careful about picking up machine guns in store rooms and other areas.  Ammo clips can only be picked up if you have room to hold more bullets, but if you touch a machine gun, you will pick it up even if your ammo is full and get nothing for it.  The same is true of chainguns and other weapons you may come across later, so be careful.

5 - Be prepared to face a "boss" enemy at the end of the level.  It's not nearly as tough as the actual bosses of the game, but you'll still need to be careful.  The first level is a good place to observe enemy behavior,  because you're guaranteed to face a lot more of all enemy types as the game goes on.

That's all the tips you get!  If you're still having trouble, send an email, and I'll try to help.  The game does get easier after the first couple levels, but then it gets tougher again...hang in there!
