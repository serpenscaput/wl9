I'm going to make more formal notes later, these are just some notes to anyone who 
is testing.

* Core gameplay is very similar to the original game *
* Debugmode parameter is the same as the original game (--noss) and there are no 
activation keys
* Xmas levels from 2007-2010 are spread across level 39-49 - they can be accessed 
from a new secret in level 1 or warped to

In addition to bug finding, I'm looking for feedback on the game

Difficulty compared to the original
Suggestions for improvment
1920x1080 support - if you have a 1080p monitor, please try and run the game in this 
mode by adding "--resf 1920 1080"

There are some new features for better playability/asethetics:

***New options menu in the control menu
	This is still a WIP, but you can change various game features in this menu.
	Visual aspects can be toggled as well as control style.
	One-button strafing turns the set left and right keys into side-step keys and sets 
the mouse so it can only rotate the view (not move the player)
	Always run is for one button strafing mode, I may add to the classic style later

	Can be accessed in game by pressing F11
	
-New smart automap (press M to access it)
	While viewing a map, you can use the direction controls or the mouse to scroll around 
the map and press -/+ to zoom the map
	The map only shows spots that the player has seen within a certain range.  Only 
enemies that are dead or are on the player's screen are visible on the map,
	so the automap cannot be used for cheating that way
	The debug cheat auto map (Tab + M) is a fully exposed map with an additional feature: 
hold the tab button to highlight pushwalls, treasure, keys
	Press ESC or Enter to leave the map

-New fullscreen HUD
	Complete HUD for fullscreen mode
	Because the face is missing, the health font changes color based on state. (green 
is godmode)
	
-Backspace + [Key] toggles
	- Backspace + T 		toggles textures (this also turns off weather and clouds)
	- Backspace + W         toggles weather (sky/snow/rain/parallax)
	- Backspace + C         toggles clouds
	- Backspace + B         displays # of times game was saved and if cheats were used

	- Backspace + F         toggles FPS counter
	- Backspace + N			toggles notifications
	
-Mouse wheel is supported for changing weapons

-Some new debug keys
	-I'm not going to list them all, but try them out if you get the chance [except 
Q, that still quits ;)]
