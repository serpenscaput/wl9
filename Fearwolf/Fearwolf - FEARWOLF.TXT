Wolfenstein 3D Fear of Vengance Final 1.0.

Does this name sound familiar ? Maybe it's because a guy Adam Chapman made
the first set, it really wasn't something to get excited about. However i
choose 10 levels out of 30 - 35 levels from his set in order to make 1 full
episode. I'll probably make a completely new boss level instead of the old,
which only is a slightly extended level of the original.

Note : the light fluoroscent tubes that are in fearwolf, were made back in
the thirties almost exclusively used by different industries.

I am looking for some beta testers and/or level designers for episode 3 and 4. 
19 levels are missing, particularly the secret and the boss level in episode
4. If anyone are interested in contributing for 1 of the 2 reasons please
email me at : Fraulein (at) ofir.dk.
Before sending me any levels let me know asap, ok ?

If anyone got the wolfmaster (wolfms11.zip) collection put together by Keith
Heithmann, i would appreciate it if you contacted me. I have been looking for
it for a looong time.
