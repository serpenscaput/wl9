Mac Wolfenstein 3D ECWolf Mapping Pack

This is a simple mapping and asset pack for use with the dev version of
ECWolf/LZWolf and WDC, to make it a bit easier to use the extended 
features that ECWolf enables, like remote-activated doors/pushwalls,
flats, plane heights, light levels and more!  

To use this, simply use this PK3 as a base for your project,
and using WDC, start a new project using Wolfenstein 3D as 
your base project, set MAXPLANES to 4 and 
load ec_macwolf.wmc as your map definition file. 

To use the new features, I recommend reading my tutorials on
Zombie's WOLFSOURCE website, which details some of the 
features in depth.

The original version of this construction kit was 
designed for making maps using the original MacWolf
data files, however since A)those are very difficult to 
find and B)MacWolf support is extremely incomplete, I have
re-done this entire toolkit to rely on the PC Wolfenstein
data files rather than the Mac files.  This includes 
all assets, sprites, textures and sounds. I have also
recreated the original MacWolf status bar using LATCHCFG. 
Instead of ogg rip music, this contains IMF renditions of the
MacWolf music.  If you would like to use the ogg rips, download
the pack included with 37 1/2 Encounter.
If MacWolf support is completed, I will
make a stripped down version of this for use with those
data files.  The very least needed to be done to make your
own maps with this pack is to load up the WMC def in 
WDC, make your map, and then export and package and 
dump the WAD into the Maps folder in this PK3
(Remember to write your MAPINFO lump!)

NOTE:  If you try to play a vanilla MacWolf mod or
regular ol MacWolf with this, it probably won't work right.  
Best to use a shim file and write a new MAPINFO.
