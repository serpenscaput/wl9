This is a simple mapping and asset pack for use with the dev version of
ECWolf/LZWolf and WDC, to make it a bit easier to use the extended 
features that ECWolf enables, like remote-activated doors/pushwalls,
flats, plane heights, light levels and more!  This toolkit is based
Off of the Mac family of Wolf3D ports, with 3 different pk3 files, each containing
The necessary assets to replicate said version of Wolf3D within ECWolf.

To use this, simply use this PK3 as a base for your project,
and using WDC, start a new project using Wolfenstein 3D as 
your base project, set MAXPLANES to 4 and 
load ec_macwolf.wmc as your map definition file. 

To use the new features, I recommend reading my tutorials on
Zombie's WOLFSOURCE website, which details some of the 
features in depth.

This toolkit is based off of MacWolf's XLAT/WMC, with 3 diff base pk3s that can be used
To play created levels with. The very least needed to be done to make your
own maps with this pack is to load up the WMC def in 
WDC, make your map, and then export and package and 
dump the WAD into the Maps folder in this PK3
(Remember to write your MAPINFO lump!)

Included are 2 quick and dirty ports of the Mac and the Jaguar versions based on these toolkits and the maps ripped from the SNES version.  (They're basically the same thing
Just with slightly different graphics.  Atari apparently sacrificed good sounds for
Good weapon graphics lol)
