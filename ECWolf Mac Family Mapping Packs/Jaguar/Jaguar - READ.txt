This is a simple mapping and asset pack for use with the dev version of
ECWolf/LZWolf and WDC, to make it a bit easier to use the extended 
features that ECWolf enables, like remote-activated doors/pushwalls,
flats, plane heights, light levels and more!  

To use this, simply use this PK3 as a base for your project,
and using WDC, start a new project using Wolfenstein 3D as 
your base project, set MAXPLANES to 4 and 
load ec_macwolf.wmc as your map definition file. 

To use the new features, I recommend reading my tutorials on
Zombie's WOLFSOURCE website, which details some of the 
features in depth.

This toolkit is based off of EC_Macwolf, with Jaguar
assets instead.  This of course lacks the ogg rip music,
which I will make a separate pack at a later date.

The very least needed to be done to make your
own maps with this pack is to load up the WMC def in 
WDC, make your map, and then export and package and 
dump the WAD into the Maps folder in this PK3
(Remember to write your MAPINFO lump!)

NOTE:  If you try to play a vanilla MacWolf mod or
regular ol MacWolf with this, it probably won't work right.  
Best to use a shim file and write a new MAPINFO.
