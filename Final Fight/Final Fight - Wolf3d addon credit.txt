Thanks to Eric Lin for hosting the Wolf3D Haven forum, which brought so many people 
together to work on this mod. Also, to drchainsaw, Eric, WLHack and others who beta 
tested the levels.

And for the last, thanks to id Software for making Wolfenstein 3D and for providing 
the source code. Without them and their game, we'd have no addons.
