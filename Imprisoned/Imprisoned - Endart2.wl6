^C7d PRISON LEADER ASSASSINATED
^G32,16,5
^C00 The prison leader screams in agony as you pump one last bullet into his corrupted 
body. You step forward to his corpse and frown in disgust. You grunt in anger as 
you kick his blood-stained head. Hoisting your gun onto your shoulders, you begin 
your walk out of the prison.
