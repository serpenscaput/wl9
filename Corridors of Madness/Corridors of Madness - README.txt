===INTRODUCTION===

Thanks for downloading CORRIDORS OF MADNESS, my 39th mod. This mod was based on QUEST FOR THE GENERAL, a mod I originally made back in 2006. As with many other mods I made during that time it was never finished properly, and I always regretted this. Dean Horton put together a basic yet still functional and interesting EXE that never really got its due. 22 brand new levels later and, well... Here it is.

Coding changes include:

* Seamless level flow (20 straight, 2 secret)
* Changed ceiling colours
* Changed music
* Extra static objects
* Ammo box

===============

Imagine if you will an alternate gateway between Episodes 5 & 6 of the original Wolfenstein 3D...

===STORYLINE===

BJ stands in front of the rusty gates of Castle Offenbach, dead set on rampage. Though Hitler is alive and kicking in Berlin - allegedly - General Fettgesicht is one tough wad of meat that would look much better dead and buried, together with his evil schemes and vicious and pedantic minions. Infiltrate the castle, BJ! And kick some ass!

===LEVEL GUIDE===

Cellars (Levels 1-5): Where the vilest of the vile Nazis come to party. Crushed bones, blood pools aplenty and structurally very dark and confusing. Look out! It appears that Fettgesicht's old friend Schabbs lent some of his merchandise to keep an eye out for intruders.

Dungeon rampart (Level 6): This level separates the cellars from the main part of the castle. Having just laid Gretel Grosse to waste, it appears her brother is screaming bloody murder. Did he really schlep all the way from mouldy ole' Castle Wolfenstein just to be here and duke it out with you?!

Admin zone (Levels 7-10): Here you will find jacked-up officers zooming about, watching that you won't flip over their precious plants and tables. Your dossier also informs you that access to a spurious hideaway can be found somewhere around these parts. What in blazes can that possibly mean?

Tunnel (Level 11): This slimy monstrosity connects the different areas of Castle Offenbach. No holds barred! Watch out for the bad guys in their ever so slightly intricate hidey-holes.

Lower main castle (Levels 12-15): The main meat of Castle Offenbach, adorned with odd alcoves, rusty suits of armor and a musty aroma of the will for sweet escape. Tread ye lightly, BJ - there be queer noises about!

Upper main castle (Levels 16-18): The upper crust, definitely not as spooky and intricate as the lower half of the castle. However the circumstances, the officers here are definitely not afraid of getting their hands dirty. Watch your step! Apparently, before the castle was ransacked by Fettgesicht and his posse it was a stronghold of the SA (Sturmabteilung). All those guys are dead and gone now. But it appears their secret hideaway can be found here somewhere... Who knows what precious cargo this area may hold?

Ultramega security zone (Level 19): Use your GPMG34 and use it well, BJ. The SS have created massive human shields at this precipice, the very opening to the final chamber that houses the evil madman himself.

Fettgesicht's palace (Level 20): Garnished with splendour and ornaments from glories of decades past, the general can be located here encased in loot, loutishness and lewd Nazis whose sole purpose are to eliminate you, BJ Blazkowicz. Get them before they get you!

Secret areas (Levels 21-22): These two levels are accessed off the grid. Count your lucky stars if you manage to break into these places!
