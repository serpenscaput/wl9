Weird33.zip - October 10th, 2003.
This exe was created for the original levels.

Haha... I made this from scratch today - yup, in one day; I
was pretty bored I guess! lol. Only the first 2 levels of each
episode are fully functional, the rest of them I tinkered
with the way the game reads maps (so I could have some kind
of unpredictable adventure - heh), but they're pretty buggy,
so play those 3+ levels at your own risk. Have fun trying to
figure out how all all those cheezio strings work! :)

By the way... do you like pizza?!
