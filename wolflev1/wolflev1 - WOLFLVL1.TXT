Hello all you Wolf-3D fans out there!

I have modified level 1 just slightly (!) to make it a little
more difficult (actually, a lot more difficult).  Even I have
trouble getting through on Death Incarnate.

First of all, thanks to Apogee Software for a great game...

Thanks to Bill Kirby who made a great map editor...

Now, the hints:

1) Look for secret doors
2) Use tactical maneuvering when in a battle
3) Try to remain calm when you enter the maze and can't get out!
   (you can with just a liiiiiiiiiiiitle patience)
4) Only level 1 has been altered, but it should keep you busy,
   try to find everything
5) Yes, it is level 1 but you will have trouble recognizing it
6) Levels 2-10 are normal and I will modify them 1 at a time in
   the future
7) Keep track of extra health and ammo, you are going to need it.
8) The game is not quite perfect, I need some more hints from
   others who have done this.
9) Check those corners!!!!!!!
10) There are LOTS of goodies!!!!



Let me know what your scores are and what kind of problems you
seem to encounter.  This is a fun game and this should keep it
interesting.  Of course, there is no charge since the game
belongs to Apogee.  Happy gaming!
