*** //// Â¿HOW TO PLAY? //// ***

To play the mod you must have installed DOSBox wich can be obtained from the official page.

https://www.dosbox.com/

* Install the program and open it.

* Once the program opens you will see a command line pop up.

* Write the next line -> mount c c:\leben (the "C" represents the letter of the drive you have the mod installed on)

* If you did this successfully you will see the message "Drive C is mounted as local directory c:\leben\"

* Next you must enter "c:" and once you press Enter you will see the lines at the beginning change to the drive you have
selected (in this case it should say C:\).

* Now you must write "wolf3d" and once you press Enter the game should start.

* Have fun!
