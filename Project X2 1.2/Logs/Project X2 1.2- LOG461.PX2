^C7d Lab Accident

^C2a I heard we had a "terrible accident" in the secret test labs. I don't know the details, but apparently an experiment went wrong or something and the lab had to be sealed off to contain the "outbreak." Outbreak of what? A virus? They didn't say. Whatever it was, it sure killed a lot of scientists and soldiers. End of Log.
