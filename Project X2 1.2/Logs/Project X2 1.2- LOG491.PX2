^C7d Outbreak

^C2a All hell has literally broken loose in this sector. The experiment to enhance the Demons backfired and we've completely lost control over them. Now they're busy killing our soldiers and scientists. Many of our dead personnel have been possessed by the Demons and are attacking us aswell. The area has been locked down to contain this outbreak, but some of us were left behind. We're trapped now. I don't know how much longer I can stay alive. End of Log.
