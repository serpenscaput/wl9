^C7d Thoughts on Demons...

^C2a Why do we have to keep so many of these Demons around? They make great soldiers and all, but they give me the creeps. I don't trust them. And while The Command has assured us that they're totally under our control, how long will that last? We're dropping like flies, thanks to that bastard Rain, yet we continue to amass more and more of these creatures from Hell. Soon, they will greatly outnumber us, and who knows what will happen then. End of Log.
