^C7d Missing Black Key

^C2a Fucking Jackson, he lost this key to my hidden office behind a pushwall somewhere here. I told him to hide it somewhere, 'till I got back, because I needed to get my ummm... stuff. All my personal things are...hmmm?...What...THEY ARE NOT PORNO, DAMN IT!! Anyways, Jackson told me he hid my key in a pushable wall in the dog pen. I don't believe him. End of Log.
