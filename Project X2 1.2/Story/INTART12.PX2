^C7dChapter 2: Isa's Ice Palace

^C2aThis is Rain, journal date February 19th, 2026. The ship has arrived at the coast of Oregon. I managed to get in contact with HQ and report on my situation. They've instructed me to meet up with a scout in the forest near the docks. I have to listen for a slight pinging sound to find him. I just hope that the Neo's don't get to him before I do. End of Log.
