^C7dChapter 1: Escape From Mt. Fuji

^C2aRain, journal date February 14th, 2026. I've reached the center of the temple. It turns out the Neo-Vampires have been trying to summon the ghost of Zero to fight for their cause. But it seems that their little scheme backfired, because Zero's angered spirit is killing anyone who enters his tomb ... regardless of whose side they're on.

Wait, someone's coming. Who's there? Show yourself! My God, it's him... Zero.
