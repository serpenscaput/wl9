^C7dChapter 2: Isa's Ice Palace

^C2aThis is Rain, journal date February 24th, 2026. The battle is raging. I see lots of dead forces and Neo's throughout the castle. What a mess. Thomas tells me that Isa is escaping through the Ramparts with a bunch of shotgun guys. She's making her way to the roof where a helicopter will come to pick her up. I must stop her before it's too late. End of Log.
