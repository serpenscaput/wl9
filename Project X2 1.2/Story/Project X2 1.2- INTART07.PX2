^C7dChapter 1: Escape From Mt. Fuji

^C2aRain here once again, journal date February 14th, 2026. I've found the entrance to the Temple of Zero. Looks like Edmund's forces are already in there. When they disturbed this sacred place, they awakened something ... something powerful ... something angry. That's what is causing it to snow endlessly;  even the mountain has less snow than this. I have to go deep into the temple to stop those bastards before they unleash God knows what. End of Log.
