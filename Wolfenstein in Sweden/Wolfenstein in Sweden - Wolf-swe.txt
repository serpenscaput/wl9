This is the Wolf-Swe version of the shareware edition of Wolfenstein (v1.4).
This game has new graphics (with ghoast soldiers) and new sound.
It also combines 4 different map versions.
Use the the file map.bat to control the game.
The map.bat file also controls the savegames.It will back up savegames from
maps you are not currently using !!



Programs I used creating Wlf-Swe were "Wolfedit" by Bill Kirby and "Wlfaud" by
Bill Neisius.

The commands:


Map [1,2,3,4] :The different maps you may choose.
