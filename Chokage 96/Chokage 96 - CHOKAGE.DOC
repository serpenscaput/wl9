                       Chokster's Super Chokage V1.22
                    ==========By==Chris=Chokan==========

What's New with CHOKAGE?
--------------------------
  It's Got Some New Walls, Bad Guys, Props, Guns, Sounds, Levels. Even I'm
in there (I'm The Guy With The Huge Head, that's because I'm such a MasterMind
at everything, Not!)

How Much Room Does CHOKAGE Take Up On Your Hard Drive?
-------------------------------------------------------
-This Game Take approximately 1.6 Mb (Megabytes) on your Hard Drive 
-If Another Wolfgame is added (JennyStein, Hemio The King) the combination
 of 2 games is about 2.4 Mb of your Hard Drive and the combination of 3 is 
 about 3.2 Mb.

Problems?
----------
Here are some problems that may happen during the game.

P: After a while playing, the sounds on the game go off but the
   music stays on.

S: 1. To get the sound back on just press F7 and press "N" after and they will
      go back on (this no sound thing may come bach though) 
   2. Try putting a line in your config.sys SET BLASTER=A220 D1 I7 (The 
      Numbers May Vary depending on the sound address you are using) 
   3. Take Off The "Digitized Sound" on the sound menu on Wolfenstein if it
      bothers you too much (This will make different sounds for the guys)
   4. This may sound real weird, but the first time I played CHOKAGE the
      sound didn't work too good but the more I played it the better it worked

P: Sometimes I get this "Out Of Memory" message after I die.
S: Don't know how to fix that, Wolfenstein even does that to me sometimes.

P: In some places, the guys are shooting me but I don't get hurt
S: Good, that's how some places are supposed to be

The Music Menu
---------------
If you have Corridor 7 (Complete Version [disk or CD version], you're in luck.
Chokster's Super Chokage & Wolfenstein can play Corridor 7 Music if you ever
get tired of those old Wolf tunes or just want something new.  To get to this
Music Menu, type "M" at the "Chokage Main Menu". You may find the "Wall" sound 
annoying with the Corridor 7 Music, if so just take off the "Sound Effects"
in the Wolfenstein Sound Menu or change it to PC Speaker but you can still 
leave on the "Digitized Sounds" and the music. If you don't have Sound 
Blaster or compatable, PC Speaker will play new sounds on Wolfenstein with
the Corridor 7 Music Option. There may be "minor" problems with the Corridor 
7 Music Option but when you turn the music back to Wolfenstein Music, those 
problems will vanish. And if you installed the "chokage.wav" and you've got
Windows 3.1 (Other versions may work) and a Sound Blaster, Adlib or any other
sound systems that are compatible with Windows 3.1, you can play awesome music
in Wolfenstein (With people actually talking).  Here's how: Go into Windows,
make a new "Program Item" called Super Wolfenstein (There are quite a few
icons I put in the Wolfenstein Directory). Go into the program "Sound 
Recorder" (should be in the Accesories group), goto "File" and open the 
CHOKAGE.WAV file (It's in your Wolfenstein Directory if you have it), play 
it and click on the Wolfenstein Icon without leaving "Sound Recorder"). The
first time it won't work (we'll it might for you). If it says (Error with 
Adlib) or something like that, click on it again (don't click on the one that
you just did, this time there should be an icon on the bottom left of the 
screen to click on). At first, Wolfenstein will look screwed up and will go a 
bit slower but that will all change after playing it for a while. When you get
to the menu in Wolfenstein, go to the "Sound" and change the Sound Effects to
Sound Blaster/Adlib. The songs in CHOKAGE.WAV don't last too long but you can 
decrease the speed (nevermind, This Doesn't Work) or copy the songs over and 
over again so it will last longer, you can do this in the "Sound Recorder" 
program, also in the "Sound Recorder" go into the Effects menu and press Echo
3 times(press it once, wait, go back into the menu press it again, etc.), it 
sound awesome. You can also use other WAV files for this operation too (mind 
you, they got to last at least a minute for them to actually be on 
Wolfenstein).  Another way of playing this instead of using "Sound Recorder"
is to go into "Control Panel" in the "Main" group, go to "Sound" and change
the "Windows Start" sound file to CHOKAGE.WAV and get out of Windows, then go
back in Windows and load Wolfenstein (This way, the first time you click on
the Wolfenstein icon, it won't screw-up).

Make Your Own Levels
---------------------
If you have any Editors (Mapedit, Wolfedit or Wolfsnd), you can make your own
games for Wolfenstein (and they will appear in the "Chokage Main Menu"). If 
you already have one made, ZIP it with "PKZIP 1993" or older; unless you have 
a PKUNZIP of the same year as your PKZIP that you should copy to your 
Wolfenstein directory (ZIP these files: Gamemaps.wl6, Maphead.wl6 & Vswap.wl6 
as Yours.dat [use all the edited files if possible]). If you haven't made any
game, press "E" at the "Chokage Main Menu" to start (If you have any Editors).
If you don't have any editors, the only thing you when you've pushed "E" is 
make a story for your game.

Quick Play
------------
If you've got "JennyStein", "Hemio The King" or "Your Levels" in Wolfenstein, 
you can play the same game you've played last again by typing "P" in the 
"Chokage Main Menu". (Example: If you played JennyStein yesturday & never 
played any other Option since, "P" will play JennyStein in fast mode) "Fast 
Mode" is when the game is not unzipped (For any computer (especially slow 
ones), Fast Mode is a REALLY good idea).

The Intro Sequence
-------------------
This little "Thing" I found in this game called "The Lion King". I switched
some of the stuff around on it (Yes, that screwed-up spot in the middle was 
always there). The music is pretty cool if you've got a Sound Blaster. See if 
you can understand the weirdness I wrote. It was really hard to make this 
thing because it was coded and the words have to have letters the same as in 
other words and bla bla bla...

Krazy Wolfenstein
------------------
Krazy Wolfenstein is for those people who find Wolfenstein too easy or just
feel like trying something different.  First of all, you CAN'T change your 
gun. You may notice in most levels that you can't even get any gun (even if 
you walk over it). Also, the screen is smaller than you can actually make it 
(If you don't like the screen small, you can change it by going to "CHANGE 
VIEW" in Wolfenstein). Another thing is that you only use 4 buttons (the 
arrow keys), this may seem REALLY hard at first to manage since all the keys 
move you the wrong way & you must move backwards to fire the gun and... I'll 
leave the rest of this a surprise for you. By the way, it is possible to stab 
someone. I'm trying to beat Episode 1 on Wolfenstein on "Can I Play Daddy Mode"
without saving my game (Never saving my game ever, not if I'm gonna die, and
I never exit the game until I've died all my men or beaten the Episode [For 
some reason dying all my men is usually how it always ends up] and I go 
without changing any of the settings (Screen size, controls) So far I've made 
it to level 4, see if you can do better under those conditions. I usually turn 
off the "Sound Effects" but not the "Digitized Sounds" for my Sound Blaster 
because of that annoying noise when you try to turn right. Go for KRAZY, it's 
a REAL challenge. Type "K" in the "Chokage Main Menu" to get to this 
Screwed-Up Wacky Game.

The Delete (Destroy) Menu
--------------------------
If you get tired of Chokster's Super Chokage or even Wolfenstein, you can 
erase them by going into the "Destroy Menu". To get there, type "D" in the
"Chokage Main Menu".

How To get To The Chokage Main Menu
------------------------------------
It's Easy, just type CHOKAGE in your wolfenstein directory.

How To Make Spear Of Destiny Real Weird
-----------------------------------------
If you have Spear Of Destiny installed to the same directory as Wolfenstein, 
you have probably found out that you can play it in the "Chokage Main Menu". 
If you're bored of all those normal guys and stuff just rename your VSWAP.SOD
to VSWAP.BAK and then goto the "Chokage Main Menu" and play Spear Of Destiny
and there will be really weird guys. Whatever Wolfenstein game you have used
last (Wolfenstein, Chokster's Super Chokage, Jennystein, etc...) will be on
Spear Of Destiny in a weird way.
                                      
Funny Stuff and Tips: If the Wolfenstein Graphics are on Spear Of Destiny, the 
#4 gun would be the best for shooting, it's a knife bazooka (Apparently all 
the other guns fill up half the screen), you can find the knife bazooka in two
places on the first level. Shoot the guards and they'll make weird noises.
Some walls even look like a two year old drew them. My favorite boss is the
one at level 18. Story: Sailor Dude and Doc were havin' a bet about who'd win 
the stanley cup, Sailor Man picked Toronto and Doc picked Monreal. But as we 
all know, Toronto never won a cup since the 60's and Sailor Dude was so 
furious about Monreal winning the cup that he starting screaming and launching 
Doc at the wall along with a few of his weapons and his ghost. You'll probably 
notice that he doesn't really clean up after himself (all that ketchup running 
down his shirt from the last few hamburgers he ate). Watch out though, Sailor 
Dude has really bad aim and couldn't hit the wall if he was right infront of 
it, and he doesn't really like visitors while tormenting his victims. With
my graphics (Super Chokage), the awesomest dude is the Alien at level 21.
Story: Looks like the two cool guys have teamed up to make the ultimate 
fighting machine, Chokster lauches Muscle BJ at you with amazing force. The
key here is to shoot Chokster while he's charging his brain cells back up
(That's when his head is disappearing from thinking too hard). I won't 
tell you what the rest of the stuff is though, surprises are fun.

How To Have Cool Walls In Wolfenstein
---------------------------------------
Go to the first episode, dispose of all the guys in the first level on "Can
I Play Daddy". Save your game. Now go into Blake Stone/Corridor 7/Spear Of
Destiny and then go back to your saved game in Wolfenstein. Usually the 
"Weird" walls turn into walls off Blake Stone/Corridor 7/Spear Of Destiny.
The Spear Of Destiny walls look good (except for that little part on the 
left side) but with the other games, the colours change but you can still
tell the picture is from that game (like the one with the bad dude on Blake
Stone is looking at you). You can do this with many games and programs. Just
run the game and then go into Wolfenstein and load your saved game. It even
works on WOLFEDIT (Not that the walls look that good though).

Why Are The Guards Hangin' Off The Roof?
-----------------------------------------
   A long time ago, the Guards stood straight and followed the instructions,
but after a few years on the job guarding Castle Wolfenstein, some guards
took a new role, guard Castle Chokage. But what they didn't know was the king
of Castle Chokage (The Chokster) was mean and wanted everything. For the 
guards, this was pure hell and they started slackin' off because it was so
boring and sometimes they would even fall asleep on the job. One gloomy 
morning, the king noticed a guard sleeping on the job and got so mad, he 
shook the Castle so hard and it got practically destroyed. Unfortunately,
he lived. So did most of the Guards. Some of them were killed, others injured. 
The Castle still hasn't been fixed up very much. Some floors were somewhat out 
of whack, the other floors had survived the crash (Luckily). After a few days 
of thinking about how to stop the Guards from sleeping on the job, the king 
insisted that they wear plungers on their feet and hang off the roof, that way 
sleeping on the job would be more agravating than standing. Some guards tried 
to get off the roof but they only injured themselves and were shot into the 
dungeons by the kings royal servants. 

Why Kill The Nice Doggies?
---------------------------
  All dogs hate being treated bad, these dogs are whipped, slashed, tormented 
day by day. They have been trained to kill intruders, nomatter how long it 
takes them, they're life is a living hell and sending them to a warm, playful
and fun doggy heaven would make their every dreams to come true. But you have
a fun life, getting rid of all those evil souls who brought you to this dump
of a place that doesn't deserve to even be called a Castle (Maybe a Junkyard
or a gigantic shack would be a better name). If you want to have fun and feel
like you're doin' the right thing, don't let those dumb guards boss around the 
doggies (send them to heaven) and send those freakin' bastards to hell. Hey,
if you rather let the doggies kill you than you kill them, think about how
screwed that plan sounds, guards get to boss around and hurt the doggies,
doggies are in more of a hellish place than hell could ever be, and you're
probably dead and thinkin' "Hey, I'm not ready for this yet" and the doggies 
probably don't have much more time to live because they only live about 13
years and they're probably already about 8 or 9 and won't get fed enough to 
live much longer.

Why Are There Millions Of BJs?
-------------------------------
   When Dr. Schabbs conducted an experiment to make dead guys come back to
life, he didn't know BJs were involved. Remember in Castle Wolfenstein
where you died several times before escaping. Well those dead BJs got mixed up
with the other dead guys during Dr. Schabbs's experiment and now there's live
BJs trained to kick your ass down the highway (in this case, down the elevator
shaft), have fun gettin' rid of these guys!!!

Why Are There Guards In Secret Passages & In The Walls?
---------------------------------------------------------   
   Most of the guards in the secret passages were trapped in there from the
big crash and couldn't find a way out, some of them were put there because 
they were caught sleeping on the job. The guards in the walls got stuck there
from the big crash too, but they found ways of getting out of the fallen 
walls (some of them anyway).

I Am So Obsessed With Wofenstein That...
------------------------------------------
   Some signs of being obsessed with wolfenstein are:
   -You make wolfenstein levels during school
   -All your stories have pictures of those Wolfenstein Guys (BJ, Guard, 
    Dr. Schabbs, Sailor Dude)
   -You Dream About Being In Wolfenstein
   -Your name is CHRIS CHOKAN

   I've dreamed about being in Wolfenstein many times. I remember one time I 
dreamed about being in one of Carrot Top's levels where the blue guys would 
always come out of their little room so we put a deaf guard behind the door. 
In my dream, the blue guys launched away that deaf guard (The guys weren't 
dots, they were real people) and started coming after me. I didn't shoot, I 
ran like hell to the elevator & YIKES!, there was a blue guy with me in the 
elevator. Somehow, we reached Pizza Hut, and boy did it have a big chandelire 
and the blue guy was telling me about some guys he knew from school, I saw 
some guys (& girls) I knew from a long time ago too & while I was talking with 
this girl (Angela Frawley) I woke up. Another cool dream I had (Last Night 
96/11/01) was that me and the white guys were trying to bring us to Level 61
but those damm blue guards wouldn't co-operate. So I went into my editor 
and switched the blue guys to guards (this is probably the stupidest dream 
you've ever heard of) and then I went into the elevator and were telling the 
white guys (who had somehow turned into G.I. Joe's) to shoot me so the 
operation would work (For some stupid reason, I didn't even feel any pain from 
the bullets). After they shot me, I flicked the switch and we ended up in 
another world. Next thing I remebered, me and this girl (Amanda Glenn) were 
walking in this clear tube to find something (I thing it was dust) and I had 
to get up to go to the washroom (Shucks!).

What Are The Levels Actually Suppose-To Be?
---------------------------------------------

* Episode 1 

Notes: This is a "Have A Blastin Good Time" kind of episode, if you can find
       level 10, you are a GENIUS!!! (It's real tough)  
       
- Level 1: Crumbled So Bad  

The crash has wrecked everything in sight, and Chokster is up somewhere else
with his pototo chips and soda pop muchin' down infront of the old tube not
caring a bit about what happened during the crash to his guards.  You (A 
prisoner sentanced to death by Chokster [Like many others] because of not
slaving for Chokster) are trying to escape from this dumpster. The exit is
real tough to find.

* Episode 3

- Level 1: Chris's House

You (Chris) are in the middle of sleeping in your bed when you hear some 
blabber-mouths talking so you decide to get up. You were always a very 
protective guy, those 80 or so bullets in your room could actually be used 
for some reasonable purpose (unlike all the other times you used them for
blowing away mom and dad's furniture and appliances, the kitchen is pratically
empty because of everything destroyed and sent out on garbage day, along with
your sister Jenny, but for some reason the garbage man never put your sister
in the dump truck to send her to the junkyard, some stupid law I guess).  As
you go to feed your dog (Robin) he jumps up and starts attacking you (Must
of been because you haven't gave him any water since the last time he spilled
it on the floor [about 5 or 6 weeks ago]). After battling Robin, you find your
mom & dad just hangin' around (They don't look so good, must of been cause 
they stayed up late last night). You feel a craving for some pizza (which you 
have plenty of left from yesturday's supper) and gobble a few hundred slices 
of them down (Nowonder why your so fat).  You still feel hungry for pizza and 
there's not even a crum left so you go to your sister's room to get some more 
money. As usual, she fell off her bed again and "Yuck!", had her periods on 
the floor. You decide never to go in there again, or atleast until the next 
time you need to borrow (I should say TAKE) some money from her. "Grrr!" 
You've just about had enough of those guys next door blabbin away and grab 
enough bullets until you're pistol is fully loaded to go and toast those 
chatter-boxes (Too bad you don't have you're Chaingun, maybe mom threw it away 
somewhere because it was too scary)... 

Hint: A long time ago, while you were working on ways of disposing the 
neibours who hadn't paid you for cutting their wrecked lawn, you came up
with a chemical reaction that could freeze someone in a manner of seconds
(Sounds pretty cool eh?). As you were walking down the road to freeze you're
first victim (Marty), you're "invisable goo" spilled all over his bricks. You 
never really paid attention to it until you noticed there was no more "goo" 
left. The "goo" still exists in the bricks (that are now placed together to 
form a wall outside their house) and it is said that if you walk in it 
backwards, you will not be frozen but your eyes will react faster and you will 
change into a magicman if you venture far beyond the goo. One neibour (Brian), 
who was scared as hell at the time was saying his friend Brad was cursed with 
these powers and as he said these magic words "Tab-Jee", he turned invincible 
and while saying "Tab-Double-You", he just disappeared. It is said that if you
use your own spells (like Emm-Eye-Ell), the goo will dissapear and the bricks 
will feel like a normal brick wall. If your really brave, find these so called 
bricks that they mention (if they actually exist), and test the "goos" powers 
(maybe it'll just freeze the life out of you).

* Episode 4

Notes: This is a "Wolfenstein Wizard" Episode, if you think you are REALLY 
       good at solving problems, try this episode (You won't beat it [If you
       beat this episode, YOU ARE SO AWESOME] It took me over 200 times to
       beat this episode (And I made this). And yes, there is an exit to every
       level (You may not think this after playing it about 500 times).

Records (Best Times)
---------------------
   I just love trying to race down levels trying to get the best times. Here's
some records I've gotten without the help of those massive cheats and without 
saving or loading my game at anytime during the RACE, see if you can do better
(Easy means on "Can I play Daddy" and hard means "I am Death Incarnate"):

Chokster's Super Chokage:         
Episode 1 (Easy):

Wolfenstein 3D:
Episode 2 (Easy): 4:53 (Try this episode with Corridor 7 Music for a blast)
Episode 5 (Easy): 8:05
Episode 6 (Easy): 17:09

Something Neato
----------------
This is an awesome way to get tubular things, like CODES.
First of all, type the CODE in Chokster's Super Chokage (THE GAME) that tells
you to: "CUT THE BULL". Types the letters of this CODE simultaiously (In their 
natural order) while you're in the "Chokage Menu". After this has been 
completed, follow these steps while you're in the "Chokage Menu":

Leave the DEATH KEY down while typing the numbers on the keypad simultaniously 
of the answer to the NUMBER QUESTION then release the DEATH KEY. 

---Death Key---
It's a name of a food company (makes alot of Dairy Stuff) pronounced the same 
as a key on your keyboard but it is spelled differently, the food company has 
an extra letter in it (The extra letter is not in B.J.'s name).

---Number Question---
How many levels there are in Spear Of Destiny; divide it by the number of
Officers there are on level 7, Episode 1, on "Can I Play Daddy?" mode on
Wolfenstein; add the amount of Pac-Man ghosts are in Wolfenstein episode 3; 
multiply by the number of colours your screen has to be to run Wolfenstein; 
add your total to the episode number that you meet Hitler; subtract this by 
number of guns you can get in Wolfenstein; multiply this by the number of 
"FINGERS" you (yourself) have [unless you're disabled], multiply this by the 
number of levels you have to go through before meeting Dr. Schabbs in 
Wolfenstein, add the total to the number of eyes the "Last Boss" on "Spear Of 
Destiny 2: Return To Danger" has; then subtract the answer by the number of 
floating Hitler guys (the magic dudes that shoot out that bubbly red stuff) 
there are in Hitler's Level on Wolfenstein.
