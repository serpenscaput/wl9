      <p>
      Game uses the same engine as Trail of Schabbs SDL-demo (2010).<br>
      For the same reason the in-game palette and some textures are 
      taken from TOS.
      </p><p>
      As the original storyline had so many gaps, it was slightly altered...<br> 
      Because of these changes, some bossfights were altered as well.
      </p><p>
      Depending on the difficulty, some enemy behavior changes. 
      </p><p>
      5th difficulty setting was originally intended to start a completely
      different game. Instead of the regular levels, player was going to have
      to play through series of challenge levels.
      </p><p>
      Shotgun was originally planned to be a double-barreled one and
      the rifle was going to be equipped with a scope (zooming was already 
      included in the games code).
      </p><p>
      Enemies reloading their weapons was not planned to be a part of the game.<br>
      It was later added to balance things out and make the game a bit easier.
      </p><p>
      As mutants were based on dogs, they had no standing frames. 
      Standing frames were added as it was hard to design athmospheric 
      levels with just the mutants patrolling the areas.
      </p><p>
      All bosses have re-recorder voicefiles.
      </p><p>
      There is a bug in the first level of the demo that causes all guards to 
      become alerted when the level finishes loading.
      </p><p>
      The morse code messages heard on one of the laboratory levels are 
      badly translated calls for help:</strong><br>
      <strong>Wir brauchen hilfe!</strong><br> 
      <strong>Sie haben die Anlage Ã¼berholt!</strong><br>
      <strong>SOS!</strong>
      </p><p>
      Originally there was going to be a secret level "The forest camp", where
      player would fight tanks with panzershreks. It was removed as it was too
      hard and did not fit the games storyline.
      </p><p>
      As an early concept, some of the knight armors in Sturmgard would attack
      the player. These knights would act like dogs and use only melee attacks,
       and to make things more interesting - you could only harm them with STG.
