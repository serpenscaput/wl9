HINTS:

EXPLORE EVERYTHING!  Some things are behind pushwalls.  Some things
are behind doors that can be only opened by switches.  Sometimes, walls
and objects that can be destroyed are blocking the path.  Just because
it seems like you're stuck, doesn't mean there isn't a way out!  It 
may be behind a switch or a touchplate....

SWITCH WEAPONS OFTEN!  Conserve your ammunition by using the lower
powered weapons on the weaker enemies!  You don't wanna face off against
Dracula with a tiny little Plasma Pistol!

USE THE AUTOMAP!!!!  It's easy to get lost!  These maps are huge!!!
