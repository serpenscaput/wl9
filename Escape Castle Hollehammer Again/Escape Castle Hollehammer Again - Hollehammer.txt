Wolf3d demo "Escape Castle Hollehammer... again"
Made by Lars Asplund (Sweden) Larshongkong@hotmail.com
Well it is a little upgrade, not very much but better than nothing!
Maybe I´m gonna do a bigger mod but thats another story!

The changes:
Walls have been changed. : Like Hitler and other...
Sounds have been changed! :Now they sounds like Germans!
Titelscreen. : But its not so cool!

Special thanks Brian Lowe and Tristan van Putten : (Wolfenstein 3-D Dome)   http://www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk


Mr Flo and his Floedit!
Bobby Bucksnort, his wolfenmods are fantastic!
And all other friends out there you now who you are!
