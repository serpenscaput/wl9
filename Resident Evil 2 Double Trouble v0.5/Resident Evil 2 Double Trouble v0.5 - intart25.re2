^C24 A SPEARS GRASP

^C00 It's just a hands grasp away, with the ending of Herr van Schintz, you know that what lies ahead is not going to be easy.

One level before you fight the manical Doctor Schabbs, you put your fears a side and continue your battle on level 25.

Remember it's a spears grasp away...
