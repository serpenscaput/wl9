	INTRODUCTION :--
========================

	Thank you for Download Double Trouble, this TC is a sequel to my first TC Rising Evil, and continues from where it stopped. To read the story of Double Trouble read on.

This TC took me 3 years to create and contains completely new graphics, levels and some new sounds and even uses the Spear of Destiny engine. Double Trouble contains many of the features found in Rising Evil and much more.

	STORY :--
========================

	As the war raged on Dr Schabbs starts to put his develish experiments to work, continously sending them into a neverending battle to kill every ally, but as all the plans of the nazi regime start to fall into line, B.J. steps in destroying Dr Schabbs, his plans, his undead army of Aero Drones and his dream to help Hitler rule the world. As all hope failed for the Nazi Regime, rumours start to rise again of another evil experiment going on. It has been heard that these experiments are being done by the twin brother of the late Artz Schabbs, an evil doctor by the name of Franz Schabbs.

	It's 1943, it's a year later, and Franz Schabbs has continued with what his brother started and in his conquest to create a stronger Nazi regime he has also stolen the Spear of destiny (out from underneath the noses of its keepers) with the help of Hitler's most loyalist soldgier, a man by the name of Herr van Schintz. Amongst these deadly experiments the evil Dr Schabbs has created a stronger band of undead mutants, that have been programmed to kill every Ally that gets in the way of Franz Schabbs.

	With the help of the Spear, Franz Schabbs plans are not only to create a group of undead fighting machines, but also to resurrect his brother in order to help Hitler rule the world and destroy every Ally alive, hence the Allies giving this evil plot the name "Double Trouble".

	It has been heard that these experiments are being done in a castle not far from the city Dusseldorf, where the nazis are enslaving the local peasants, not only to put them to work, but to turn them into a deadly mean fighting machines. This castle is situated on a mountain top and its easiest access point is through the caves found in the mountain, which you'll be able to intrude via the forest surrounding the mountain, and be careful as there are many traps found through out the forest and the inner levels of the castle.

	Your mission is to infiltrate the nazi castle, destroying Dr Schabbs deady creations, and the evil doctor himself and to retrieve the spear before he fully uses it, to its capacity and brings his brother back to life.

NOTE: Certain things work differently on different computers, such as the shading, the shading darkness may vary on computers due the monitor as I've encontered on my two computers (Meaning...some monitors are darker than others so on certain computers that have a darker monitor, it may be a little harder to play certain levels).
