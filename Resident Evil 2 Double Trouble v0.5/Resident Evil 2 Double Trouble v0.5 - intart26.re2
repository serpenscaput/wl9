^C24 AND NOW...

^C00 ...Your final battle is ahead (at least you hope it's your final). Dr Schabbs is ready and waiting. He's been waiting for this moment ever since his heard the news of what you did to his brother.

You've been warned...

...This next battle is not going to be an easy one, getting hold of the spear is easy, but retreiving it from the grip of the Dr is another story.
