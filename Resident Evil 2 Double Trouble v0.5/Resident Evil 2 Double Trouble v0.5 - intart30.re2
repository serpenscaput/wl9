^C24 SECRET LEVEL

^C00 A secret level has been discovered, it's the central area that you may find appealing. The central tower is where the main action is to be found, that is with the help of a "Displacement Artifact".

There is one hint: An extra bonus lies ahead, hid to the left, before you look to the right.
