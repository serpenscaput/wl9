    `--------------------[ Version 1.0 3-19-94 ]---------------------'


Star Wars 3D is simply an add-on for Apogee's and IDGames's Wolfenstein 3D
Shareware version 1.0.  It will only work with 1.0, so don't try it with
v1.4 or anything else.

--INSTALLATION------------------------------------------------------------
Installation is simple.  Create a new directory on you Hard Drive and
install a fresh copy of Wolfenstein 3D v1.0 into it.  (the file
W3D1-ASP.EXE) Then unzip this file into that directory, answering yes when
it askes you to overwrite any files.

--RUNNING THE GAME--------------------------------------------------------
The first time, type SW3D or WOLF3D and choose the proper options (sound,
window size, controls).  From now on you can type WOLF3D to get into the
game, SW3D to quickly get into the game, or type SW for the quickest way,
but you go right to level 1, without the chance to load any save games
or change the difficulty level.

--THE CHEAT CODES---------------------------------------------------------
The cheat codes only work if you type SW or SW3D, not if you type WOLF3D.
To enter the cheat codes, you must be in the game, not on any menu screens.
Hold down TAB-CTRL-ENTER to enter cheat mode.  Then you hold town TAB and
press the folowing keys for diferent cheat:

G - GOD MODE (nothing hurts you)
I - FREE ITEMS (once for gun #3, again for gun #4)
W - WARP TO ANY LEVEL (type in the level number when it asks you to)
N - NO CLIPPING (walk through walls)
Q - QUIT (quits quickly, rather then pressing ESC then ESC-Y)
S - SLOW MOTION (and slow is an understatement)
E - BEAT CURRENT LEVEL
Q - QUIT QUICKLY
O - OVER HEAD MAP

There are others, but these are the most helpfull ones. TAB E and TAB Q
doesn't seem to allways work on my computer, sometimes it just freezes up
and erases the config file.  Wierd. Also, try not to cheat unless you're
stuck, otherwize it takes out all the fun!

--THE SW 3D GRAPHICS------------------------------------------------------
All SW-3D is, really, is an edited graphic file.  I think it's great and
really fun to play.  2 graphics (originally steel plating, and purple
wall [with various decorations]) only appear in 1 level each. They are
some of the best graphics in the game, so if you find 'em then have fun.

--THE SW3D LEVELS---------------------------------------------------------
The levels that come with SW3D are really the same as the originals, but
they are slightly modified so you can see more graphics.  4 graphics
(originally grey stone 3, grey stone w/ signs,  steel plating w/ signs, and
red w/ eagle) were in the graphics file, but were never put into the game.
In my levels, they are.  What this means, is you won't see the 3rd section
of the 3 panel Star Destroyer wall, or the new graphic for the Steel
w/signs and grey w/ signs if you play these graphics with the original
levels.

--MAPDATA.DEF & OBJDATA.DEF-----------------------------------------------
For those of you who have MAPEDIT or a similar program, you will know what
these files are.  The names off the walls and some of the objects have
been changed in these file so if you wanna edit maps with SW3D graphics,
it's easier.  Do not use these files with the registered version, or SOD,
or even shareware version 1.4, because I took out all of the graphics from
those versions.  Also, do not put down any "unknowns" when editing, it
could freeze up your computer when you try to play a level with it in it.

--WHAT'S TO COME IN FUTURE VERSIONS OF SW3D-------------------------------
v1.0 just has different walls, you still fight nazis.  v1.5 will have
edited sounds and weapons.  The knife will become a light saber, the guns
blasters, etc.  And if I get a WOLF3D editor that you can edit the
background music, all 10 levels will have various SW music from the
SW 4CD music anthology set.  If v2.0 ever comes out, the nazis will become
Storm troopers, and the last guy will become Darth Vader.  Vader'll be
cool, he say stuff from the movies (like the force is with you and stuff).
If v2.5 ever comes out, It'll have 10 new levels.  If v3.0 ever comes out,
It'll be for the registerred version of WOLF3D, and Hitler will be replaced
with the Emperor, the others guys the red stormtroopers, etc. That ones
gonna be cool, if it ever comes out.

--THANKS------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for Bill Kirby for creating WOLFEDIT, and MAPEDIT, without wich none
of this would have been created.  Thanks to whoever made Graphip Workshop,
without wich almost all of the walls couldn't have been made.  And thanks
to each and every user of the FIDONET STAR WARS CONF, without their
encouragement and GIF sending I would have never have even made this.  I
probably wouldn't be a huge SW fan, either.  Thanx also to everyone else
I forgot.

--FINAL WORDS-------------------------------------------------------------
If you know who I am, do not send me any money.  Send it to Apogee.
Register WOLF, register Blake Stone, go out and buy Spear of Destiny, I
don't care.  Or send it to ID and register DOOM, just as long as I
don't get any money.  I apologize if I offended anyone at Apogee or ID
for creating this, but I'm obviously not the first to do it, so you're
probably used to it by now.  I'm also sorry if I offended anyone at
LUCASARTS, but I *really* hope that Lucasarts will instead like the idea
and make a SW3D of their own.  The level in Rebel Assualt was great, but
we want more STAR WARS!
