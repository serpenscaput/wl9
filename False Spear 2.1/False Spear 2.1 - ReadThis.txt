--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the source code you will find lot's of features from / references to the Trail of Schabbs, 
but as they are dated back to the early stages of the development, there is no quarantee 
that they will work with the current code (at least you need to make a lot of adjustments) and 
even if they do, you need the files from the TOS SDL-demo (released 2010) to make the game run.

Despite that I decided to keep them in the source just in case. Who knows, maybe you
find some features usefull in your mod (e.g. animated walls/floor/ceilings). I need to warn
you though, the old TOS code is quite a spaghetti so prepare to see some unexpected effects.

One last thing. To activate the TOS side of code, just uncomment the "TRAILOFSCHABBS"
definition from the version.h-file but remember to comment out the "FALSESPEAR" definition.
Also I suggest that you implement WSJ's sprite offset for new actors, especially if you
are going to add more guards.
