^C25 Franz the SS-Gruppenleiter

^C15 This floor is guarded by the SS-Gruppen- leiter... The most wicked gear of the nazi warmachine.

^C15 It is better to stock some ammunition because he doesn't have a good sense of humor, and it won't make things better if the humor is pointing him with a gun...
^C15 So B.J. good luck and remember to say goodbye to Franz from me.
