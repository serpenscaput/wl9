-- The False Spear 2.0 (SDL)                                            --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is this all about:
- This is the polished release of the False Spear SDL, that should get
  rid of the nastiest bugs found from the game after its initial release.
 
What is included:
- Source code, updated game and mapping definitions

What has changed:
- Several sprites have been updated and weapon balance is now better 
 (thanks to DoomJedi for his assistance). 
- Flamethrower now has a radius and the rifle has a scope (press 'V' to zoom).
- Levels has been changed a bit to give every weapon more usage.
- Added "Wolf4SDL_flash.exe" to the game folder. This is a test executable 
  for The_Fish's advanced shading (press 'B' for flashlight).
- Screen resolution has been restricted: 
  320x200 - 640x480 with --res and 320x200 - 1280x720 with --resf
- Other small fixes and edits here and there

NOTE: In these instructions I assume you have not changed the games code.
To include the mapping definitions in ChaosEdit, simply copy the content
of "ChaosEdit files"-folder to your ChaosEdit folder and replace everything
if prompt.

- Gate control-object has to be placed on top of the switch wall (id 2/3).
  When operated, it will open/close all gates and black columns in the level.

- Special pushwall switches should also be placed on the top of the switch wall.

  NOTE: placing more than one of switch of the same type will cause strange
  errors with the wall pictures. Also even though you can add two different
  switches for one pushwall - this should be avoided as it might break the game.


- Detonator will "break" every single directional concrete wall in the level and

  in the last level the earthquake-tile will work as the same.

- Both campfire and poison will hurt player when stepped on.

- SS-Gruppenleiter will drop a key (rusty) only in level 3 and ÜberMutant drops
  a key (bronze) only in level 9. Bryson will always drop a silver key and Kippling

  will drop a golden key.

- Golden key door will not work in the last level (number 24).

- Player can access secret levels from levels 6, 12 and 17.
 
- Wallnum 225/226 should be left alone as the code places them over/under of each 
door. 
  Also when placing floor/ceiling if you want to use texture with wallnum greater 
than 255,
  you should place texture with wallnum 9 - 203 instead (wallnum 9 = 256 and 203 
= 449).
