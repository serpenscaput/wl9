Boesenstein SDL Version

The Dos exe has been included too but if this is used then delete the supplied config.wl1 
file.

This variant of Wolfenstein v1.4 was made with Floedit 2, Paint Shop Pro 7 and my 
own Seefiles program.

Graphics and sounds (some are modified) come from...

Wolfenstein3D
Christmas Wolf
Lost Episodes
Hotel Romanstein
Duke Does Deutschland
No Place to hide
Halloween
Barney
-and a few Doom graphics and some of my own make.
The statue is by Arno Breker, Hitler's favorite sculptor.

About this game...

The levels are of medium difficulty.
No keys are behind secret doors.
Some (but not all) locked doors are there for logical reasons and need not be opened.

The bloody skeleton has been replaced by a red-eyed rat.
Always watch your back!
