1-----Setup

Dungeon Cephalis requires WOLFENSTEIN 3D to run. You may want to back up the files VSWAP.WL6, GAMEMAPS.WL6, and MAPHEAD.WL6, as you may need them to recover WOLFENSTEIN 3D. Please follow these directions to play Dungeon C£phalis:

A. Unzip dcephalis.zip into your wolfenstein directory with your unzipper (winzip, pkunzip, zipmagic, etc.).

B. Click on Wolf3d.exe to run.

Please enjoy the game!


2-----Troubleshooting

Of you encounter any problems during gameplay, please see the FAQ to answer your question. If your question is not answered, you may e-mail me and I will be happy to fix them for you.


3-----Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Where did the files that I just unzipped go?

A: Did you unzip them to your wolf 3d directory? Your best bet is to do that.

Q: Why does the game freeze frequently during gameplay?

A: Usually the answer lies in your machine. Is your computer setup to run DOS based files?

Q: After about an hour of gameplay, the sound gets funky. Why is that?

A: That occurs frequently and I have no clue how to fix that. That's been a problem for me from the beginning. Sorry!

Q: The game won't play and when I click on the .exe it just says "Runtime Error - can't find rtm.exe". Why?

A: Usually that occurs when you click on "Wolf.exe" and not "Wolf3d.exe". If that problem still occurs, I will send you a copy of the game.
