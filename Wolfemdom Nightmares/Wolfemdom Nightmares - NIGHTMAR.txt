ABOUT LSHSPAIN
===========

I appreciate the creativity of some modders creating modern settings, REALISTIC or FUNNY. I tried to develop a mod with the following features:

- Femenine characters contrasting the natural instinct for respecting and sharing life with the social insecurity  -authority, emptiness, consumerism.
- Idealisations may lead to tension, alienation and unbalanced relationships -PG-18 in no case offensive but symbolic!-
- Unnatural fears CAN BE CHALLENGED without violent guns or avoided running away. 
- Hide and sneak, discover non violent defense... or escape from immune fears. Use keys for finding energy, power and surprises. 

If you have feedback about the mod, please leave a message in the same webpage where you found it.
