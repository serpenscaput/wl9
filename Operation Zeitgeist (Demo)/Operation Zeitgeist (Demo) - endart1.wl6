You curse under your breath. So Lief wasn't at the Lunatic Fringe's mountain hideout 
- he must be at one of the other locations.

You start to head back for base when you receive a radio message from Central Command. 
You are instructed to head for a nearby sewage processing plant, where the Fringe 
have begun their escape...
