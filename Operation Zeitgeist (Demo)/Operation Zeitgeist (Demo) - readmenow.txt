OPERATION: ZEITGEIST

This is a much better demo than the last one and is the final demo before the full 
6 episodes will be replaced. It is much more representative of the final game.

(I didn't update the credits screen in-game yet.)

KNOWN ISSUES:

-It's best to save at the beginning of a level, because in most levels, there will 
be weapons immediately available. The reason for this is because when loading a saved 
game, there is a chance that the game will neglect to give the player the assault 
rifle or minigun.

-In level 9 of episode 1, the screen flickers and there are some slowdown issues. 
This is a combination of the rain and sky as well as the large numbers of Flame Troopers 
in the higher difficulties.

TO DO:

-Finish 4 more episodes (duh)
-Finish music and sounds
-Finish sprites
-Fix saved game bug
-Replace menu and other miscellaneous graphics

SKILLS:

Lemme play! - Easy mode. Enemy shots do less damage, and there are less enemies.


I can do it! - Medium mode. Enemy shots do more damage, but same enemy count as Lemme 
play.

Bring 'em on! - Hard mode. Enemy shots do same damage as I can do it, but more enemies.


I cannot die! - Expert mode. Enemy shots do severe damage. Each room is a life or 
death battle. One enemy sneaking up on you can kill you. Save often.
