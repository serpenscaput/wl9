Castle of the Nazi Zombies! is a stand alone total conversion of
Wolfenstien 3D. That right, stand alone.  That means you do not
need have the original Wolf3D game to run it. (Although if you
haven't played the original Wolf3D, we highly recommend it.)

CNZ! is based on the Wolf3D source code created by ID software
in 1991.  CNZ! runs DOS native. So, unless your running DOS 5.0
on a 486, we recommend you get your self a copy of DOSBOX for
your operating system.  With DOSBOX you can run CNZ! on
Windows, MAC OS, and even Linux.

Download DOSBOX - www.dosbox.xom

Your mission: Infiltrate the Nazi castle that is overrun with the
undead of the fascist kind, Destroy the Evil Lab, and Escape
with your life! CNZ! is 10 exciting levels of Nazi Zombie killing
fun for the whole family!

Special thanks to the makers of Chaos-edit 

and to M2 for lending me thier JASON graphic.

Also included in this version is an SDL exe and associated files needed to run the 
game on Vista and later Windows versions without using DOSBOX.

Please note that 'saved games' made with a Dos exe are not compatible with the SDL 
exe, and vice versa. Also, delete the Config.wl1 file first if changing from using 
one exe to the other.
