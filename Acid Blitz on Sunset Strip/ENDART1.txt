^C7eCONGRATULATIONS!
^c00With both Mondstahl and Jitterman dead at your hand, you make your way out of the complex. As instructed, you shoot off a signal flare. Within minutes, hundreds of national guard troops are on hand to secure the site. In the crowd, you see the two men who initially contacted you. As you approach to shake their hands, you feel a sharp pinch in the back of your neck and then the world goes dark....

You wake up in a padded cell. It seems your handlers had other ideas about what was in your best interest. 
The next few months are a blur of electroshocks, injections of thorazine and degrading
group therapy sessions until one day when a familiar face opens the door to your cell....
COMING UP NEXT: V2s over Appalachia!
