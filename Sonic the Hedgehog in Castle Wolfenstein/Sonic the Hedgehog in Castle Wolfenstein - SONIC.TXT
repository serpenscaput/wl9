also the game is setup to run in the C:\WOLF2   directory. cio!




SONIC THE HEDGE HOG
IN
CASTLE WOLFIENSTIEN

Race through levels and beat your best time!
Watch out! though shareware based these levels
are full of TRICKS and SUPRISES that will get 
you!!

The Wall graphics are based on what i've seen
of the Sonic the Hedgehog game. The bad guys
Were custom made to have 'some' resembelence
to the robo baddies. I admit I couldn't 
get the 'animations' to work out properly.

I made this way back in 1993/1994
Nobody seemed interested in it back then.
Doom wasnt even out at that time.

So for all those who like the original wolf'
and those who like sonic.
Enjoy!!

P.S. Feel free to edit the music/sound or 
character bar.

BTW i tried a variety of wall graphics and found
that many detailed ones COULDNT be used. The 3d
engine ended up 'mangeling' them into a mess of
static and confusion.
