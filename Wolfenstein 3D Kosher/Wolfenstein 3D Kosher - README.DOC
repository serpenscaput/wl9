                     WOLFENSTEIN 3-D KOSHER
              BY: PETER RINGERING (ringpe@wwc.edu)


     This archive contains a file that will make your Wolfenstein
3-D a more kosher game.  Instead of shooting at people, you shoot
at objects which, like the original guards, will shoot at you.
(If they didn't shoot at you, then the game wouldn't be Wolfen-
stein.)  I also changed the skeletons, bones, and blood into
objects.  However, in order to keep the original "spirit" of the
game, I left the Nazi symbolism.  Another thing I couldn't change
was Mr. Blazkowics's bloody face when he get's wounded.  In
short, I changed the game from an "R-rated" game into a "PG-
rated" game.  However, the incredible action is still intact.

INSTALLATION
------------

     To install Wolf 3-D Kosher, you will need to do the follow-
ing simple steps:  First, rename your original VSWAP.WL1 that's
in your Wolf 3-D directory to VSWAP.ORG. Then copy the VSWAP.KOS
to your Wolf 3-D directory as VSWAP.WL1 (ie: COPY VSWAP.KOS
\[wolf3d dir]\ VSWAP.WL1)  Then start up Wolf 3-D and enjoy the
game.

     If you ever want to go back to the original Wolf 3-D charac-
ters and objects, just rename VSWAP.WL1 to VSWAP.KOS.  Then
rename VSWAP.ORG to VSWAP.WL1.

ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE
------------------

     You can use this file with Enigma's Nightmare I, II, and
III.  However, you will not be able to use the special walls that
come with Enigma's Nightmare.  You will have to use the original
Wolf 3-D walls.  So, if you wish to use this with Enigma's Night-
mare, do not install the special graphics.

---------------------------------
CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL WOLF 3-D
---------------------------------

     The guards have been changed into "marbles".  The original
brown guards are now brown marbles and the original SS blue offi-
cers are now blue marbles.  The dogs are green marbles, and the
big "boss" at the end is a gigantic blue marble.  These marbles
will shoot at you too, therefore, I recommend using the "God
Mode" when you first play this version of the game.  When you
destroy a marble with your gun, the marble will fall apart and
turn into a bunch of marble junk on the floor.  When a blue
marble is killed, it will turn into blue junk on the floor, when
a brown marble is killed, it will turn into brown junk, and when
a green marble is killed, it will turn into green junk.

     The blood that was on the purple wall was turned into tar
and the hanging skeleton was changed into a hanging potted plant. 
(To add a natural touch.)  I replaced the skeletons in the prison
with smiley faces in the cells and most of the skeletons and
piles of bones on the floor were changed into smiley faces.

     Beyond these changes, the game is the same.  Have fun!

UPDATES

     As soon as I improve on my computer artistic abilities, I'll
be working on making the marbles "roll" better and look more like
marbles.  Then I'll upload updates.

DONATIONS

     Please don't send any to me.  Eventhough a lot of work went
into it, I enjoyed making this.  However, if you do feel "com-
pelled" to make donations, send them to your local charity.  I'm
sure they need it a lot more than I do.
