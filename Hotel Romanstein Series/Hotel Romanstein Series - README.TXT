This EXE has been custom-made for Hotel Romanstein 6 and 7 to run 
the games in DOS. It uses a modified version of Chris Chokan's 
memboost.zip source code, and has been modified in the following ways:

Adjusted defines in VERSION.H to compile as shareware 1.4 EXE
Increased MAXSTATS in WL_DEF.H to 900
Decreased MAXACTORS in WL_DEF.H to 148
Decreased MAXDOORS in WL_DEF.H to 58
Increased MAXVISABLE in WL_DRAW.C to 100

It has been tested on a machine with 608k of conventional memory and
one with 580k.

Many thanks to Chris Chokan and all of the contributors to the DHW 
Code Crackers thread "[Info] Freeing Up Memory - A Must Read!"

This EXE is also useful for Hotel Romanstein 2, 3, and 5. The first
and 4th in the series can be played in DOS using the normal shareware 
version 1.4 EXE.

Enjoy!
