************************ WELCOME FELLOW WOLFENSTEINER ***********************

 I am honored that you have chosen my game. I wish to thank you & all of the
people who helped on this game.. I (as you are) am a full-blooded
WOLFENSTEINER, and a DOOMer too.. But in the intresets of this text, well
stick to Wolf!
 For years I've been messing with Wolf3d & designing maps here & there, never
once thinkning I was going to be SERIOUS about it, then fumbling through a
local BBS, I came across a new WOLF3D floor W3WAD ( Wolf wad, cute eh?) & 
poped it in.. I was blown away at what was going on... As soon as you shot 1
GUARD 1 GUARD, the whole place went bannanas... Doors flying, guards yelling
& me standing there in the middle of this, trying to figure out what's going
on... Don't get me wrong, the floors were GREAT , but they lacked something 
that makes a GOOD Wolf3d GREAT, TASTE!!!!! It's hard, YES, it's a trial to
get out YES, but where's the fun of walking through a place that's dead
empty ( save for all the bodies lying around YUCK!), with only the secret
passages to find.. Though if setup right this could make for a GREAT game
but not in that kind of format..
 Right then & there I though, " MAN, that's it... I'm going to do this &
make sure I do it the way, I've seen it from Id & others who I've seen
& know what to do in making a GREAT Wolf3d game... So I go ahold of 
*** MAPEDIT 8 ****, the SIMPLESTway to go & the BEST TOO.. So after 2 years &
hundreds of hours vamping & revamping, this is what I've come up with... 

 ***************************** The Clone Wars ******************************

Back Ground:

  For the past few months, there have been reports from within the German
high command that they have been doing research into cloning.. But being only
in the 40's it seems IMPOSSIBLE to do it, but now your worst fears have just 
been confirmed.. A telephone call from a insider in the High command has just
confirmed that the german have not just tried, but ARE using cloning for
wafare & have been for sometime...
 The end seems darker now, germans able to create their own SUPER GUARDS & 
just grow another one when it dies.. An ifinate army... This must be stoped
before there is NO chance to save the world... 
 Your mission is to enter the camp where it is said that a map of the location
of this "FARM" is.. You need to find that map & bring it back to HQ so they
can build a new plan of attack on this "FARM OF DEATH".... Go.. & may the 
gods be with you, because you're going to need ALL the luck to get out alive
from "THE CLONE WARS"....

********************************* ENDING ************************************


 So now it's up to you to go through & find that map & get out ALIVE!!
Enjoy your runn through my personal war!
