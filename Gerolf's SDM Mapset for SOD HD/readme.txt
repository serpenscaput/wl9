"Gerolf's SDM Mapset"

The Spear of Destiny Demo only allows so many textures and objects for use
in the map files. I wanted to work within these limitations and see what I
could pull off. 

This download contains a 2-level SDM mapset with its own SDL EXE. There are
minor code changes added to the EXE. Enjoy. . .
