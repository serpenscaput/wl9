Day of the Chaingun

This game has recieved positive comments from Chris Chokan and Wes Desjardins, as 
well as two of my friends.

The Nazis have invented a cool chaingun. Steal it. 6 levels, with around 6-20 minutes 
of gaming time, depending on your speed
(Chris Chokan, creator of Chokage managed to beat my top-score in MY OWN GAME in 
a couple of minutes. He beat me at my own
game!).

Day of the Chaingun is out already, and can be downloaded from the Wolf 3d Dome (I 
forgot the url, look it up on Google.com)
or www.geocities.com/rosswilliams59100/dotc.zip.


Gore

You are an elite Star Commando on a starship fighting enemies who are under the leadership 
of a tyrant called Gore. You get
the picture. My friends liked this game. We went to the library at school to download 
and play it until the librarian kicked
us out. Chris Chokan said he laughed when he saw the gimpy, retarded main character 
attempt to jump at the end of the game.
