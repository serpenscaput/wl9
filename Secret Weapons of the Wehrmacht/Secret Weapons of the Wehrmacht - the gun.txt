This game is based on a real weapon, the famous Stg-44: the first ever assault-rifle. 
The zombies weren't real though.

Knife-Shiny Knife

Pistol-Luger P08

Sub-machine gun-MP40

Chaingun-MkB42 H (early prototype model of Stg-44).

Hans Grosse-Uber Soldat (genetically modified cyborg zombie)

Story: We've received reports of a new German weapon in the Litchenstein Werhmacht 
Weapons Research Castle. We would like you
to go in an steal this weapon, the MkB42(H) and any plans and military secrets. Allied 
Scientists like to read military
secrets. We have also heard reports of many corpses being taken to Castle Litchenstein. 
Either the Nazis are so desperate to
wash they are melting down the fat of the bodies to make soap, or they are doing 
something particularly more evil. Yeah, find
out about this, and uh, if possible, steal military secrets about that. You will 
be inserted into the Castle by sneaking in
through a pickle truck, driving in to supply the Reich with salty treats. Once there 
you'll finish the mission and walk back
to the Spy headquarters (we can't tell you where it is. Sorry!).
