This is a beta version of The Thirteenth Floor: Special Edition.  This is not a complete version.  Some of its features include: every weapon separate (just getting the chaingun doesn't get you the machine gun), separate ammo caches for every weapon, trigger switches (most, but not all, make new pushable blocks and make others un-pushable.  There is one trigger switch on Level 1 that will make the secret elevator take you to a different, and new, secret level.)

Please e-mail me at barichm0@netscape.net if you find any bugs or concerns.
