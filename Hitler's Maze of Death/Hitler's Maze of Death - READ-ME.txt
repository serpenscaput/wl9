Hitler's Maze of Death

This is a one level game created by Patrick Gray
The concept was by Konrad
I would like to give credit to all the add-ons i borrowed 
graphics and sounds from. They are:

Spear Resurrection
Mutantstein 4
WolfenDoom
Himmlers SS
A Madmans Dream
KKK Beta
*I apologize to the creators of any add-ons that i forgot.
+ Graphics from Spear of Destiny and The Lost Episodes

Your mission is simple, you are to kill Hitler.
Find your way through the maze fighting off gaurds.
In order to find get the key you must find a secret where you must
defeat the Angel of Death in order to get the key. When you are looking
for the Angel of Death, beware, some secrets contain those 
indestructable creatures known as Pac-Men. However, there is only one 
real Pac-Man in this maze, the other 3 are different creatures with
identical powers. 

There is one known bug in the game. When you see the title screen, 
then the credits screen, dont wait for the demo or the game will 
freeze. I unfortunantly have no idea how to fix this.
