MegaDemo 1.2 (15-Dez-1999)
Welcome to the new MegaDemo of FloEdit, world's best editing tool for the popular 
ID-Software games Wolfenstein-3D and Spear Of Destiny! 

This demonstation shows you the following features: 
  * New walls
  * New guards
  * New sprites
  * New weapons (well, new gfx for the weapons)
  * New digitized sounds
  * No elevators - kill Kenny on every floor to get to the next level!
  * No episode separation 


The game has got 6 levels. It's now a lot more easy to cheat, since I think it's 
up to you to cheat or not. So you don't need to enter any command-line parameters 
anymore, as well as you don't need to press any special key combination to cheat.


Here's it:
  * Press [M], [I] and [L] keys at the same time to get keys, health and bullets

  * Press [TAB] and [G] to get to god mode
  * Press [TAB] and [W] to warp to another level (last level is 6)
  * Press [TAB] and [Q] for fast quitting the game
All other cheats you know from the game are also supported, I only showed you the 
most important ones here.

I don't think that it's necessary to give you are story for this - just KILL KENNY!!!
