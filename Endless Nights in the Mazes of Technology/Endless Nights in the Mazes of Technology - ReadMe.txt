Storyline:

The year is 1956. After the interference of Captain William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz 
in the Nazi project Operation Künstliche Denker, the Nazis suffered heavy blows. 
For a while, the Allies gained the upper hand. However, all was lost when the mutants 
began to march onto the battlefields.Annihilating the massive Ally armies, the hundreds 
of mutants, armed with some of the latest technology of the new Third Reich, suddenly 
were everywhere. In no time World War 2 was lost, and as the skies went dark the 
world was taken over by the Nazis. Massive technology booms around Germany have caused 
a new utopia to form around the world, one where the cool cold metal holds the people 
in chains. Hitler has become almost godlike, and the massive cities of metal and 
neon lights all advertise his glorious image. No one strong enough to end the war 
is still alive, and what few falling pockets exist are nowhere close to the Furher's 
massive capital. As the world grows dark, it seems there is no one left to save it. 
No one except for Blakowitz.

Chapter 1: Server Rooms and Supercomputers

Blazkowicz awakens on cool, metal ground. Ticks and whirrs have blended in with the 
pricing white noise in his ears, and the rumbles of a thousand machines below quietly 
vibrate the floor. He stands up and discovers he is wearing the same grey jumpsuit, 
with the same tears and stains. However, it is damp with a purple liquid substance. 
Quickly, Blazkowicz reaches into his pockets and hostler and discovers his old combat 
knife as well as his obtained Walther P38. His head aches with the powerful roaring, 
as if he is becoming a part of it. He stands up to discover a room filled with glass 
tubs. In each glass tub lays a person, either in civilian or military clothing. However, 
their heads are all gray, and they all leak purple fluid. Little robots in the tubs 
monitor and replace the blood as well as put gears into the people. Blazkowicz, taking 
a step back from the madness, looks behind to discover his own tub. Whatever they 
were doing to him must have been taking a lot longer, yet his head still aches from 
it and his sweat is discolored. He hears a clicking sound, and as he steps forward 
a little machine with a red eye on the ceiling seems to be watching him from its 
corner. Blazkowicz remains cautious and looks out, to see a nazi in black uniform 
with a blue pistol at his waist. Pulling out his Walther P38, as Blazkowicz rushes 
to meet the enemy head on, and as the questions spin in his head, a prominent hope 
presents itself. The hope that the bullets of the future work in his guns!

Chapter 2: Coolant Pools and Metal Corridors

From his initial encounters, Blazkowicz has learned many things. Almost all of the 
soldiers, not including the dogs, have the metal arms meant to repair any biological 
and technological damage to the cyborg soldiers when they "die." Another problem 
is the arms can be remotely disabled, but require the "mother" to be destroyed. Luckily, 
Blazkowicz is good at sabotaging elevators and will not have to deal with these monsters 
of metal and flesh again if all goes well. The bunkers are built on the foundations 
of the original bunkers of World War II, as decayed bricks sit behind metal panels. 
An odder feature is fetuses in odd stands. The purpose of these "blanks" is unknown, 
but they seem to surge as if they can grow rather quickly if given a blueprint. Finally, 
Blazkowicz is still in Berlin. The massive blue buildings and sparking water shining 
from the night outside is some new Berlin, as Blazkowicz has discovered. The world 
has crumpled and unethical science has created a utopia of dystopian proportions. 
Humanoid machines have rounded up hundreds of protesters and converted them to mutants, 
but pockets still exist. Blazkowicz's mission: To find the "mother" and destroy it 
once and for all! 

Chapter 3: The Furherbunker

The final floor of the fortress is the massive Furherbunker. Hitler has made two 
mistakes as the Emperor of the NeoWorld: He has left his guards down, left pockets 
of well-armed resistance and, most fatal of all, left the great Blazkowicz close 
at hand. Now, BJ has entered the blue walls of the super huge techno-bunker to meet 
the Furher head on. However, with the clicking and whirring of the walls come binary 
strings, and his head aches with the calls of something living and thinking from 
within the gears. He has seen the eyes of the thinker; now he hears the calls of 
this thinker. Blazkowicz needs to do something about the noises, the great echoes 
of the being hiding in the wires. But first, Blazkowicz must reach the Furher in 
all of his glory and end the true "mother," the Emperor of the Neoworld. Only then 
will the world have a chance to defeat the Nazis once and for all.
