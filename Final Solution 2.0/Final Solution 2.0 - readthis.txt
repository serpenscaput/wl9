Details:

This is the full version of the game. All levels, all graphics, all sounds,
everything's completed. This is the result of 1,5 years of hard work. Have
fun with it and send any questions, feedback or whatsoever to my email adress.
The full manual comes after the installation. Read it by opening the file
"Manual.DOC" with Microsoft Word or "Manual.TXT" with NotePad or just start the game 
and 
select "Read This!" from the game's main menu. Be sure to have read both of them!

Note by Brian Lowe: The original version of 'tfs' had a bug on level 8 where it wasn't 
possible to collect the gold key. Tristan asked me to fix this and this latest version 
(dated 1/26/01) solves the problem. A few extra guards, effects etc have also been 
added on level 8 and a saved game from level 7 is included.
