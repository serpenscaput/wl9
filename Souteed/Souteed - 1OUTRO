^C[Brown]As you close the steel bulkhead and break off the handle to ^C[DarkGreen]Dr. 
Soute's ^C[Brown]bunker of nightmares, you feel the relief wash over you. The doctor 
had the tools and instructions to create a mutant army, but without the skill and 
knowledge his mentor had, all he managed to create was a few mutans and a horde of 
mindless monsters, killing any living being in their sight. Strangely, ^C[DarkGreen]Dr. 
Soute ^C[Brown] seemed immune to their aggression, but he wasn't immune to good ol' 
fashioned lead poisoning.

You radio in to HQ for extraction. May this island and it's awful secrets rest forever.


THE END. ^C00
