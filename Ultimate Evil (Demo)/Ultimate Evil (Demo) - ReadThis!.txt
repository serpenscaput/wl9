::Introduction::
Hails.
My name is Raziel and I'm a 18 years old from israel (unfortunetly..) anyway.. This 
game was made me
Raziel, or Human_Waste or whatever you want to call me.. This is my FIRST TC so dont 
expect something
Uber cool.. Because you just wont.. I want to thank all the guys that helped me with 
my Source-Code problems..
And a BIG thanks for the guys at ID SOFTWARE who made this awsome game including 
some other ones...
And of course, for releasing the Wolfenstein3D Source-Code.

::Story::
Germany 1944, europe is still raging with the flames of everlasting war.
It seems that this war will never end. Lots of casualties from both sides.
And rumors of inhuman acts by the Germans are wondering around everywhere.
Stories from the battleffields telling that the Germans have a secret weapon
Some kind of Cyborglike beings mixed with human parts... 
Even stories from the wounded Allied soldiers about weird beings that armored like 
tanks,
And almost invincible... Some kind of mutants they say... A tale about Hitler's top 
doctor...
Yes, you got it right.. Dr. Schabbs himself! 
There are too many horrifying stories about this guy... Than I guess those stories 
are not a fiction at all,
And Dr. Schabbs does exist... Someone gotta put a stop to this madness and fast.

Before something terrible will happen and will change the face of the earth as we 
know it..

And there is only one man that is capable of doing this mission with full success..

You play as Major Winters! A former paratrooper and now the commander of the 55th

Commando Squad (or something like that..) 
Your mission is to infiltrate the compound which Dr. Schabbs uses for his Laboratory.

Be aware that the castle is lurking with his Soldiers and his personal Body Guards.

Clean the castle out of those mutants/cyborgs and last but not least,
Eliminate General Gruber von Hertz. 

Be careful out there M. Winters, and god speed!
Now go get em' ! (if you think this storu stinks... I DONT CARE! :) )
