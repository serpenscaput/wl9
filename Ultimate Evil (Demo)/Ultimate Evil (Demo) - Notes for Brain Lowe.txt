Hello there brain.

My name is Raziel (Human_Waste) and I want you to publish my [DEMO] game at your 
website 
(www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk). I would appreciate if you'll do that. Also, this game 
has only 4 levels 
(I planed to make 19 Levels.. But this job seems to be too hard for me... So I'll 
make only 10)
and In the full version of it those 4 levels will stay the same. I hope I didnt forget 
to add anything...
Thats all I guess... For more information about the game check my site at (www.dark-design.cjb.net)


Take Care,
Raziel.
