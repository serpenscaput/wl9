WolfBat - by Fred Kenny 

Thank you for downloading this add-on for Wolfenstein 3D. The full version of the 
game is needed to play.

This zip file contains GAMEMAPS.WL6, MAPHEAD.WL6, VSWAP.WL6 and WolfBat.TXT. Please 
do not distribute this set with any other files added.

This set has the same maps as on Wolffred, ie - there are 10 new levels on episode 
three, started by Fred Kenny and completed by Brian Lowe. Some later normal levels 
have bosses, usually Hans Grosse. All other episodes have some alterations done by 
Fred Kenny, particularly episode one. 

One difference between this set and Wolffred is - as the title suggests - bats. They 
seem to be everywhere and come in many sizes. There's also the new vivid wall designs 
too. And some treasures have been redesigned.  

Thanks go to those at id software for producing such a great game and without which 
this add-on would not be possible.
