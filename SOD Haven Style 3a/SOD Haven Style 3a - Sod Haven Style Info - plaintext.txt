========================================================================	
	Well, well. Here we are, at the second mapset of Wolf3d Haven. For those who do 
not know about the Super Haven Mapset, it is a 60 level mapset with SDL and Dos compatibility, 
along with some sweet features. (Try out Tab-O on cheats!) This should not be confused 
with Haven Mapset, a partial, earlier version of the Super Haven Mapset.
	Anyways… Here we go again, another mapset. I’m just going to keep building levels 
until I run out of ideas. Wolf3d has drained my creativity for a little bit, but 
seeing the new stuff on Sod, I can see some new levels I could create.
	This time the theme of my levels (and maybe some levels contributed by other Haven 
Members) is to present you with only High Quality levels. (On Super Haven Mapset, 
I kindda grabbed all of the levels I could’ve get) Also, treasures are a little scarcer, 
meaning that finding that cross or finding that treasure chest should mean something. 
One other theme I want to be under while making this game (along with others, of 
course) is to bring this game and readme to a whole new level of editing and bug 
checking. I want no bugs or typos at all when this set is said and done.
	This time, this Sod Mapset Mod will only use SDL. Sorry, folks. 149 Guards just 
aren’t enough. I almost blew past Ronwolf’s 699 static object limits, also. 
	Without further ado (other than this readme), please go play the Sod, Haven Style, 
abbreviated SHS. Thank you!

of the map shown, the bright yellow squares are where the enemies are. A blob of 
yellow means there’s a lot of enemies in that one area. A purple block on the map 
means a push-wall.

Difficulty:
	The game gets more difficult (in general) as you progress through the levels. 
Can I Play, Daddy?
Easiest, obviously. Anyone with a little bit of skill should be able to beat this 
game on this difficulty. Also known as the sissy difficulty level. 

Don’t Hurt Me!
This difficulty is for those who want the game to be more difficult without having 
more guards. Running around going berserk won’t be enough to win anymore.

Bring em’ On!
Now it starts to get difficult. And when I say difficult, I mean difficult. This 
difficulty is for those who want a challenge, yet don’t want a nightmare scenario 
of having to find every secret for ammo.

I am Death Incarnate
Only for those who have too much free time on their hands, and want to blast it all 
away. In this difficulty level you will die many times. Push walls are sometimes 
a must in order to survive the level. A knife is required to beat the game on a few 
specific levels. I won’t pay for any psycho-counseling required after you try to 
beat level 18. I just won’t. Of course, do not forget to save, save, save in this 
difficulty level. Sometimes I save after every guard I kill. I assure you, this game 
can be beat on this difficulty. The question is whether you are ninja enough to beat 
it. :)
Until next time, everyone! Auf Wiedersehen!
