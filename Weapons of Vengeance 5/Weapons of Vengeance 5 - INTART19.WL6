^C28 General Steinkopf
 
^C00 You've found the General hidden away in his office's where he oversees the daily running of the castle. As you approach you get the impression that preperations are under way for a special visitor, it couldn't actually be the Fuhrer himself could it?  The General may not be expecting you but this guy is always prepared, armed with a rocket launcher and a machine gun means you'll have to be extra careful to protect yourself.
