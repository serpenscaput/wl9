Storyline- Year, 2100
	The US is gone. All that is left is China, Russia, and England to preserve peace. 
About a year
ago, a massive attack by the NNF [Neo-Nazi Faction] destroyed Washington D.C. All 
Americans fled 
China or Russia. The NNF took over the German government in the year 2060. They crushed 
all opposition.
The ruins of the United States of America lay there. The US had overestimated the 
NNF. The NNF was
responsible for cryogenically freezing Hitler and the Grosse klan. Now they have 
ressurected them.
It is estimated that their army has over 50000 men in a division. THERE IS NO DOUBT 
THAT THE NNF MUST
BE TERMINATED. But this won't be easy. The NNF have discovered the ruins of a US 
base that the NNF had
attacked and abandoned by the US Army. This Base is built on a network of terraces. 
You must find your 
way through. There are switches on each battlefield you go through and you MUST turn 
them off by
pushing the switch up. This will shut off electricity to part of the base and will 
disrupt the NNF's 
operations making them weaker.
Level 1- Skirmish- Infiltrate behind NNF lines in the US near what used to be San 
Francisco. This lightly
guarded area is the newest switch installed and is located right next to a road which 
is patrolled 
every day by NNF troops. Destroy this installation by turning off the switch and 
kill off all the guards!
Level 2- Cheyenne Mountain -What the heck is this? This place used to be the base 
of the missile defense
of the US. It can take a hit from a nuke and it wouldn't budge. Unfortunately, shelling 
and bombing
of the place reduced it to ruins and a final attack killed the rest of the surviving 
US troops.
A switch is also planted here. This switch runs part of the next stronghold you will 
attack.
Level 3- They Know You're Here -On your next mission to turn off the next switch, 
you were discovered and
those NNF goons ordered you to drop your weapons. They have sent around 4-8 men straight 
at you to 
imprison you if you don't drop your weapons. Well tell those NNF guys to come and 
get you. Because you 
aren't going to get imprisoned.
Level 4- The Secret Plans of the New Nazis- Death Awaits. The Germans have created 
the ultimate bomb. 
It works by dropping the bomb and before the bomb reaches the ground, it sends a 
beam of solar light
into the ground causing a massive explosion that instantly blows people into skeletons. 
They are 
planning their first attack so go and kill the four officers behind this plan.
Level 5- Central Command- Welcome to the center of the NNF's power supply. Shutting 
this switch off will
damge NNF ops greatly. However the other power supplys will still function. Well, 
at least its a big
breakthrough!
Level 6- The Castle of the Last Stand- This is where the NNF killed off the surviving 
US Underground 
Resistance which had built this old castle. Now it is a temporary meeting site of 
2 very important NNF
commanders. Their divisions are meeting and you must kill the commanders. Then shoot 
up their army and
turn their portable switch off before they finish their plan for attacking China, 
where the remnants
of most Americans and their army is hiding.
Level 7- No Where to Hide, No Where to Run- Russian Intel has reported that there 
is a double electric
generator in what used to be Arizona. This place is where another group of commanders 
are. As your plane
flies over to drop you, you see that this place is one HECK of a filled training 
camp. You land on the 
ground and find a guard walking along the side of the building as if he knew you 
were coming...

DO NOT READ THE NEXT PART UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPLETELY FINISHED THE GAME.
IT WILL SPOIL IT AND IT IS OF NO USE TO YOU UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN 
EACH LEVEL.






















YOU DISCOVER, THAT THIS WAS A TRAP... THE NNF HAD ALREADY KNOW YOU WERE COMING.
YOU CONTINUOUSLY SHOOT. YOU WALK OUTSIDE FOR THE PICKUP HELICOPTER... BUT IT
NEVER COMES...YOU ROAM THE AREA FOR HOURS... UNTIL ANOTHER NNF DIVISION COMES.
YOU SHOOT UNTIL YOU RUN DRY OF ROUNDS. AND YOU ARE CAPTURED BY THE NNF. YOU
ARE PUT INTO A POW CAMP WITHOUT ANYONE AROUND YOU TO HELP YOU...

HOW WILL YOU ESCAPE? FIND OUT BY ORDERING THE FIRST THREE LEVELS BY E-MAIL. OR
GET THE WHOLE GAME! 43 NEW LEVELS OF INTENSE BATTLEFIELD ACTION INCLUDING THE 
BATTLE TO DESTROY THE BASE! STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH? WELL THEN GET THE FIRST
SEQUEL TO IT WHEN IT COMES OUT! 

HOW TO ORDER:IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED YET BY OUR MANAGEMENT.
THE SEQUEL-EPISODE 2 THE REBIRTH OF THE WAR [A.K.A. a NEW DICTATOR COMES TO POWER]

	AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN MADE. THE NNF STOPS TERRORIZING THE CHINESE
AND THE US STOPS FIGHTING THE NNF. YOU ARE TAKEN TO THE NEW CAPITOL OF THE NNF.
STILL BELIEVING IN FREEDOM, YOU ESCAPE AND KILL THE NNF DICTATOR HANS SIEGHEIST.

NEW DICTATOR COMES POWER THIS TIME, IT WAS FIREIG RHINKREIG, A 69 YEAR OLD 
GENERAL. HE HAS RESTARTED THE WAR. YOU MUST WORK YOU WAY TO WHAT USED TO BE NEW
MEXICO TO FIND RHINKREIG. IF YOU DO FIND HIM, TERMINATE HIM INSTANTLY!

THE NEXT ONE WILL BE ON THE INVASION OF NORTH AMERICA AND THE RETREAT OF THE NNF.
