^C25 Intermission from O.S.S.:

^C25 URGENT!!!
^C25 We just got information that SS might be planting bombs to the mines,
^C25 so your better get rid of them before they explode...

^C25 NOTE: In that case the bombs are already fused, leaving the mines before defusing 
the boms will cost you 1000 points as a penalty.
