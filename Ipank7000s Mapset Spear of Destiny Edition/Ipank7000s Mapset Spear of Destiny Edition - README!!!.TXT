2013


Here's a new mapset and the third add-on by Ipank7000, 21 new levels.Feel free to 
use them as your own project
but please give me credit if you use them (^_^) . This is the SDL version so dosbox 
or any dos emulator isn't neccessary
to play this mapset. 

You need your own registered : AUDIOHED.SOD
			       AUDIOT.SOD 
                               VSWAP.SOD 
			       VGADICT.SOD
			       VGAGRAPH.SOD
			       VGAHEAD.SOD

to play this mapset!

Because i wanted to make this as "pure SOD" as possible, there have
been minimal changes to the EXE. ceiling color was not changed to keep as the original, 

but par times have been altered. You can't get machinegun if you only get chaingun.


Thanks to:

 * The God, who has given favors, so i can finish this mapset nicely		
 * id Software for releasing the Wolf3d source code
 * Ripper for creating the Wolf4SDL engine to play Wolf3d in Windows
 * Florian Stohr which create Floedit
 * Brian Lowe for hosting this at the Wolf3d Dome and his own mapset especially 

   Wolfbel 2 is one of many of my inspirations
 * Andy_Nonymous for his "Adjusting HUD display for scores over a million" 
 * All members of DHW and Haven forum and all Wolfers who make this game still alive

---------------------------
Note & Fact:

* I have tested ALL the map (from pistol start) and it POSSIBLE to get 100%
* I don't know why but, i think making SOD map is harder than making Wolf3d map
* Level 21, if you look it from top, the level shape is japanese kanji "Shi" which 
it means "Die"
* I got inspiration of level 10 from...i forget, but it has long elevator and it's 
(thank you to the creator)
  floor 10 of episode 1 (i think it from DHW Wolf3d)
* DON'T try cheating or using warp parameter or you will screw !!! ^_^ 
* The fastest time i finished a level is level 21 (only 15 minutes) and 
  the slowest is level 02 (almost 2 months)
* I finished this map in 12 July 2013 (the next day (13 July 2013) is have been 2 
years since i 
  finished the wolf3d version
* You can hurt yourself by pressing I+T+A if you get locked and you accidentally

  save the game (You can use this if you want to challenge yourself :P)
