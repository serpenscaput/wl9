 This is a 3 level DEMO of my upcoming set REINSTAAD. These 3 levels
 won't be in the final version, so I thought I would release them as a demo
set as all the graphics are the same. I think you will find these levels 
difficult and entertaining, especially if you like to shoot'em up...lots of guards.

The first level was from a set that my grandfather worked on with LIL SNABES. Its 
a heck
 of a map and I made some mods to make it even better. the other 2 are equally as 
good.
Tristan [NAME REDACTED] has contributed some graphics as well as Ken O'Brien.
There will be a full list of credits issued with the final set. So sit back and prepare 
to wax some
Nazi butt!! They are patiently awaiting you. Enjoy! Regards, Bobby Bucksnort
