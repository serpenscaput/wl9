The DHW SDL Mapset, Spear of Destiny Edition                     19 February 2012



Here's a SoD mapset by a team of DieHard Wolfers, ready for playing in the
New Year.  Use SODSDL.exe for playing in Windows with the Wolf4SDL engine
created by Ripper. You *will* have to provide your own registered Spear of Destiny 

VGA, audio and vswap files though.

Here's the line up:

EXE by Andy Nonymous

Because we wanted to make this as "pure SoD" as possible, there have
been minimal changes to the EXE. Pushwalls will always move three spaces,
and the hitwall and spacebar sounds have been silenced.

Thanks to:

  id Software for releasing the Wolf3d source code
  Ripper for creating the Wolf4SDL engine to play Wolf3d in Windows
  Brian Lowe for hosting this at the Wolf3d Dome

Enough reading...start playing!
