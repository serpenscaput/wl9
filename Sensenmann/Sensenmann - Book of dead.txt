It's my first Game.I never have worked with a source code before. 

Only with Mapeditors of the following Games:
Tenchu 2, Timesplitters 2, Warcraft 2, Tony Hawk 2 

What would have happended if this Game have been the first famous
Shooter and not Wolfenstein 3D?

No music: press F1 2 times or press ESC and go back to the Game

Jukebox: (Hold key "m" when starting sense.exe)
 	It's not in the Main Menu because i need Book of Dead 
	(Read This) for a Story.

Levels: Episode 1: 3 + Secret		Episode 4: 3
	Episode 2: 3 + Secret		Episode 5: 3 + Secret
	Episode 3: 3 + Secret		Episode 6: 4
	and some Funlevels (but not in Episode 4,5)
	The Levels 4 and 5 in Episode 5 are from my cousin Kevin
