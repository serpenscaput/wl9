	After losing the Spear of Destiny for the third time, Hitler steals the Holy Grail. 
Hitler thinks the Holy Grail will make him invincible just like the Spear of Destiny 
did. When Nazis drink wine from the Holy Grail, they turn into mutants. The reason 
for this is because the Nazis are not Christian. When Christians drink from the Holy 
Grail, they see the Holy Grail and white. They also see a white image of the Ark 
of the Covenant. William Joseph Blazkowicz is a Christian. William Joseph must get 
the Holy Grail from Hitler.

levels 1 and 2 and Brian Lowe for levels 4 thru 7.
