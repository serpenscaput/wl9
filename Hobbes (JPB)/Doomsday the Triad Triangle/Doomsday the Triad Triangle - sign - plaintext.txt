Triad case." said Joseph Wayne to William, Harry, and the High-risk United Nations 
Taskforce agents.

Jacob Easton arrived in Quantico, Virginia. "Hello agents. I already reviewed the 
case files on the Triad. I want to let all of you know that my family was also killed 
by criminals. Those criminals were brought to justice. God judged them. The Triad 
will be brought to justice also. Let us get to work." said Jacob Easton.
