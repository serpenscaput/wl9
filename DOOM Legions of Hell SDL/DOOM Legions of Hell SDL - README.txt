Thank you for downloading DOOM: Legions of Hell (SDL Version).

First off, I'd like to state a few things:
+The maps have not been changed much from the original. Just enough to be fair, and 
that you can exit the level. Some maps just didn't work.
+The skill of these maps (first Episode, is really difficult), but 2, 3, and 4 are 
not as bad.
+The maps aren't the best, I made them when I first began modding, so they are not 
really clever, not many tricks or traps.

I remade this mod because I knew a lot of people enjoyed the game in 2006, and I 
wanted to make the game playable again. I added features into the engine that I had 
been messing around with and showing to the DiehardWolfers Community.

I also wanted to use this as a step to finishing another mod that I have worked on 
that is currently incomplete. DOOM: Legions Revisited. It was a "sort-of" sequel 
to this game, as it had improvements in the SDL engine. I did take code from that 
to make this. In this process I found bugs that were troublesome, and fixed them 
all.

If anyone has any comments or criticism on the maps or the game, I do appreciate 
helpful comments to improve on future games. I definitely want to learn from this 
experience to make an overall better mod, inside and out.
