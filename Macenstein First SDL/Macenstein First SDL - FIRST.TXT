Mac-enstein First Encounter SDL 2.0    November 20, 2010

Wolfenstein 3D (c) 1992 id Software, Inc.
First Encounter levels, artwork, sounds and music (c) 1994 InterPlay Productions


After downloading a 16 MB archive, you might say to yourself, "I only get 3 
levels?" Well, this release of the Mac-enstein SDL engine is quite an 
improvement from the previous version:

- It uses AlumiuN's Advanced Sound Manager, which allows use of OGG music 
  files of the original Mac Wolfenstein music. There are also separate 
  volume controls for music and sounds.

- All screen resolutions supported by Wolf4SDL and your monitor are possible: 
  320x200, 320x240, or any multiple of either. Defaults to 640x400. So now
  you can play in the Mac's original 640x480 mode.

- Macintosh Wolfenstein color palette is used. I took the liberty of changing 
  the duplicate (unused) colors at the end of the palette to support the PC 
  Wolf3d menus, though.

The First Encounter files will be needed for future releases, such as the 
Second Encounter. The Second Encounter's files will be added to the First's 
installation, and should be less than 1 MB. Hopefully, other releases will 
be similarly small, certainly less than 5 MB.

Some things to shoot for while you're waiting for the Second Encounter:
Can you beat my racing time of 1:45? How about 100% under 4:27?  

To play this, run FIRST.BAT. If you prefer making your own shortcut, you have
to use "--encounter 1" as a parameter to run the First Encounter. This is 
because the EXE will support other Encounters too, whose data files are not 
yet ready.

Tab-M toggles the player speed between Mac and PC, Tab-F toggles the
damage flash, and Tab-B toggles between the original (buggy) dog attack sound 
and the corrected one. All default to the Mac Wolfenstein behavior, but your
preference will be saved in the config file.

All Wolf3d v1.4 cheats are now available to use, though I would advise
against using tedlevel because that messes up the HUD level numbers. Warping
is better.

For this release, many thanks go to AlumiuN for his Advanced Sound Manager
code, and to Havoc for a code tweak that helps me package this so I can keep 
the incremental releases of the future very small. Thank you ponz for finding
some potentially embarassing bugs, and props to Matt Stath for hosting this 
on Wolfensteingoodies.com!

Following are the credits and notes from the previous version, most of 
which still apply, and the coding timelines, for those of you that are bored 
and need something to read! :-D

When Ripper first announced Wolf4SDL, I had mixed emotions about
it. I always liked Wolfenstein's simplicity, its modest system
requirements, and that it was DOS-based. 

But once I was able to compile the Wolf4SDL source code, it occurred
to me that many of the shortcomings of the original Mac-enstein 
mod could be overcome using Wolf4SDL as its base. Goodbye, single 
channel digital sound and 320x200 video resolution!

I had already tinkered with an improved color palette, and the maps
were done, so it was full speed ahead to make Mac-enstein almost 
completely Mac-like, which is really its only reason for existence 
anyway. For further motivation, I made it a goal for this to be the 
first full Wolf4SDL mod release.

This mod is hardcoded to run at 640x400 video resolution. If your
system cannot handle that, don't bother. Also, it seems a minimum
of Pentium II 400 MHz CPU would be advisable for PC players.

Special thanks to :

- Ripper for creating Wolf4SDL and his outstanding support as beta tester
- AlumiuN for his suggestions on how to have hi-res VGA images
- MCS for helping me figure out the stationary dog code, the player death
  sound cut-off and the projectile/door phenomenon
- Born4battle for his valuable Mac input
- Phroggy for helping me extract the midi data from the Mac version
- Brian Lowe (Schabbs) for hosting this mod
- "Burger" Bill Heineman for releasing the Second Encounter source code
- id Software for releasing the Wolfenstein 3d source code


Changes since the original Mac-enstein Second Encounter:

New features and switches
  - Tab-P for Ripper's Picture Grabber to make bmp screenshots
  - Tab-F to toggle damage flash (default: off)
  - Tab-M to toggle between Mac and PC player movement speeds
  - Tab-B to toggle between buggy Mac dog attack sound and corrected one
    (all toggled preferences are preserved in config file)
  - parameter --slowcpu for < 800 MHz machines, only affects level
    completed sounds and end-of-game sprites
  - parameter --showsavemsg for faster machines ensures quicksave message
    is displayed

Improved color palette
  - all greens and greys from Mac Wolfenstein palette added
   
Improved sounds 
  - new digitized sounds with sample rate of 22050 Hz
  - all Adlib sounds have been replaced by Mac Wolfenstein sounds

Hi-resolution VGA images
  -signon and logo screens
  -status bar, numbers, keys and BJ face
  -episode and difficulty selection pics
  -BJ breathing and victory pics

Bug fixes (yes there were some!)
  - bonus life awarded every 20,000 points
  - doors are not shaded
  - weapons sized closer to mac size
  - Schabbs' needles explode on walls 
  - floor 5-5 enemies don't open locked doors
