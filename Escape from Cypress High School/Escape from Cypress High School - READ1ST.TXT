Escape From Cypress High School
created by Erik Selfridge

An addon for Wolf 3D, dating from 1996. 

To install: First make a copy of the full 60 level version of Wolfenstein 3D. Call 
the folder (for example) EFCHS. Then overwrite files in the EFCHS folder with those 
contained in this zip.

Erik included the following in his original text file CHS-READ.txt:
NOTICE: ESC from CHS is all in good fun and it's creator does not condone the shooting, 
killing, maiming, or mutilation of civil servants in any way. This game is simply 
a way of letting off steam.

Please read Erik's text file CHS_READ.txt anyway before playing. It has a lot more 
info on this game.
