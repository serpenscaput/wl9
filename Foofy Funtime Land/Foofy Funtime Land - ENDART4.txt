^c11_ ^C00The curse put on  
the vase has been 
lifted! It no longer
spits snake missiles.
^c11_ ^c00Who knew clowns 
have magic abilities 
to put such curses 
on vases, rubber duckies, spraycans, 
cassette tape players, big diamonds
and even megaphones!? As the old 
saying goes; " ^cd0A bubble clown has the 
magic ability to put curses on vases, 
rubber duckies, spraycans, boom-
boxes, diamonds and megaphones! ^c00"

^c11_ ^C00The curse put on  
the vase has been 
lifted! It no longer
spits... um, snakes..
^c11_ ^c00Who knew clowns 
have... magic abilities
...I'm sorry, but I'm 
getting a strange feeling of deja vu...
^c11_ ^C00I know there is a stage in the 4th
chapter called "deja vu". Maybe that
stage had some strange effect on my 
mental state? Well, it's not completely
unimaginable I suppose. The mind can
ba a strange and unpredictable floop

the bubble clown's maniacal curse?

^Cb4NOTHING MATTERS
^c11_ ^C00Well, since I can't 
escape this madness, 
it won't matter what 
I say or what I do.
^c11_ ^C00There won't be any 
consequences, right? 
If I say HFDGP01135809 
21C7---.. -.... ....- --...10000111000111, it
will be as meaningful as if I would've
written beautiful poetry. But I guess
time flies like an arrow, whereas 
fruit flies like a banana. It's all just
rings on the pond of existence made 
by the tiny droplets of lives lived...
