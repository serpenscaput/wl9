		Pineapples Exist  Ironman9000 (Chris Choken)

(17/M/Hello??? I already told y)  1/24/02 10:09 am 

	You thought you were the only one huh? You thought 
it was all just in your mind, these suspicious yellow fruits. 
But I've got news for you... and it's not what you want to hear.
I see pinapples too! They're everywhere, not just in your 
neighbourhood. Pinapples are a natural part of life, and they're
being grown all over the world; and pretending that no one can 
see them isn't going to make them go away. I KNOW that there 
are Pinapples on this planet; and so does everyone else. They're 
real, they're high in vitamin C; and guess what --- nomatter what
you think or do, YOU CAN'T STOP THEM!!! So just accept them, ok?!?
Whatever's going through your head, drop it. Nobody believes you!
All this bullcrap about "the real reason we see pinapples" has got
to stop. GET OVER IT!!!! Sheesh...

This was posted on the Die Hard Wolfers Message board on the 24 
of January, 2002. After this, two days later we began construction
on the delibrately worst Wolfenstein TC of all time, Pineapplenstein.
On the last day of April, April 30/02, the D-Pod once again decided to create
another TC, this one also about Pineapples. It is called Pineapplenstein II
- Pineapple Strike. Chris was right, you can see them...
