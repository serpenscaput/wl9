Herein are the files containing my First Wolfenstein 3-D level
which is IMHO reasonable. Feel free to distribute it.

Installation:

1. Install a fresh copy of Wolf3D into a new directory.
2. Copy AND replace the files in this package to the
   directory you just created (which contains the
   fresh copy).
3. OPTIONAL - You might want to rename the WOLF3D.EXE file
              to "ZW1-1.EXE" to avoid confusion.
4. Run the normal EXE, start a new game and HAVE FUN!

Note 1: My next release will be an entire episode with
        this level as the first level.
Note 2: I did not distribute this as a MapEdit Floor File,
        because you would see the level overview when
        importing it. IMNSHO that spoils the fun.
Note 3: The name ZW1-1 means: Z=it's from me (Zeurkous),
        1=is't Episode 1 (My first episode), and it's
        only the first level (Level 1).
