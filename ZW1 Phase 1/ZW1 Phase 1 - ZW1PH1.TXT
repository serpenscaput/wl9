Frequently Asked Questions

Who are you?

I'm a Dutch male, 17 years old.

What is ZW1?

ZW1 is a project from me to create a 60 level pack
for the original Wolfenstein 3-D. No new graphics,
no funky source code changes, no new sounds, but
just levels.

What other episodes of ZW1 are avaiable at the time
of writing?

None :) This is the first one. But in a month or so,
the next one will be released.

How do i install these levels?

1. Install a clean copy of Wolfenstein 3-D Full Version
   in a new directory.
2. Extract _and_ overwrite the contents of the
   archive ``zw1ph1.zip'' into the new directory.
3. Run the normal EXE, and have fun!

How do i contact you about these levels?

Send an E-Mail to the above adress, and put
the text ``ZW1'' into the subject line. It
helps me sort mails.

What if i find a bug?

Follow the above instructions and explain
the bug to me, where it happened (episode and
level #), and what version of Wolfenstein 3-D
you're using.
