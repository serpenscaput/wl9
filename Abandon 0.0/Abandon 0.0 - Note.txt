Just a short note.

This game has been one of my wonders since I made it. It's my first 
level-tickling around which I still have, I think it's my first. 
I had it in my head the other day, and asked Brian to get it. 
He still had it, and sent it to me. It was the 1st of october, 2005,
and I told him it was about one year after my first Wolf EDITING experience.
Funny enough, this game also dates from october 1st. Though it's 2004.

I'm not sure you can beat all the levels, due to blocking 
(There's no floor codes either) and all that.

ENJOY!
