			 Blake Revolutions

  'BackGround Detail'


     In the Year 2056 after Thomas had a small band of revolutionists who wanted 
to put a stop to the Global nations. However it seems Global nations was prepared 
for this and sealed many major cities starving people nearly to death. Many people 
could not stand the suffering they lived in any longer and pleeded for freedom. Global 
nations granted that the civilians were to join the global nations military and support 
them. Many poeple agreed to this leading 1000's upon 1000's of people to join Global 
nations. Soon cities became empty. However in the year 2058 a company by the name 
of Crythex was formed and worked with Global Nations, however  this company was a 
major support to Global nations being the only exsisting company. Crythex was given 
permission to work with the rebels and tried to restore peace. The plan was a sucsess 
and peace was restored. Soon cities became cities again and Global nations was now 
more of a powerful empire then a government. The new government kept people in line 
with fear. In the year 3000 , A man who was working for the city police was sent 
on an investigation. His assinment was to find a man by the name of George Kraalon 
who was a supposed threat and had plans to invade and disrupt the city hospital. 
 "YOU" Robert Gyn  tried and finnaly captured George Kraalon.  George Kraalons final 
words were directed to robert as robert sent him to death row. His final words were, 
YOU! ..  YOU MUST TAKE THIS!  ITS A JOURNAL!  THE JOURNAL OF A MAN NAMED THOMAS!! 
 TAKE IT! .. AND READ IT!!!  BUT YOU CAN  ONLY ACCSESS IT WITH A CRYTHEX COMPU .. 
     Kraalon never got to finish .. as Robert released the switch to execute him 
, however Robert became very curious and went to the hospital which was run by Crythex 
and asked information on the Journal. The hospital refused to read it. Robert tried 
other Crythex locations and they refused. Untill one night came.  Friday 10 3000 
,  a group of armed men came to see robert and tried to assassinate him. They were 
from Crythex ..  now robert knew his life was in danger and could not sit back and 
 enjoy his life as he once did, he knew now .. that maybe the journal was imporant. 
 It was time robert set out and left his life of loyalty to the Global nations and 
became the new Revolutionist.  will he sucseed?  no one knows ..

'Game Intro'


       Robert sneaks through the city streets. it is 4:00 in the morning the sun 
is starting to rise, he realizes the closest Crythex location to him is the hospital. 
Robert decided to eneter the hospital through a vent system. Robert loads his pistol 
inside the vent and sees the sun rise. 

   Robert: There goes my life. okay better get moving and see whats on this Journal. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Level 1 


        Crythex Hospital

  Find the location of the Crythex mainframe 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Level 2


      Crythex Hospital Mainframe Sector

 You have located the Mainframe sector. work your way to the main CPU there you will 
beable to read the Data on the journal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As you enter the disk into the main computer the large gray power stations start 
to light up. The entire room begins to make noise. A hologram appears infront of 
Robert. Hello.  my name is Thomas Drakes, I used to be a level 3 scientist that worked 
for the Global Nations. apparently all the time that i have spent working with them 
was all for there secret war efforts as they planned to become an empire and try 
to over run everyone and everything in a dark way. We have reason to believe many 
of the americans in Global nations have been killed. I was able to escape the Global 
nations Cyro labs buildings. However it was not easy. I started a Revolution against 
Global Nations. Our goal was to put a stop to them. I made public speeches and had 
to keep on the move from city police. However people did join me. Global nations 
tried to find us as quick as they could. They have radars all over the place and 
tracking devices. No matter where you plan on going no matter what you try to do 
they will already be there waiting for you. We  had this hands on experience. I decided 
to make this Data tape journal incase somthing happens to me this Journal was to 
be given to  the passing generation of the Kraalon family. The carrier must give 
it to the next person who is strong willed and capable of continuing my work. Whoever 
you are that is reading this message i cannot give you anymore details on whats going 
on. But we have worked hard and managed to keep a generation of us going. Whoever 
you are. You will take my place and server these Revolutionists who await you. I 
dont know what year it is that your reading this, but i have gone to make your life 
easier. I am going to go and bombard the Orbital space station outside of earth which 
is tracking everyone and everything. we may not sucseed but im sure we can do enough 
damage to keep it out of line for awhile. PAY ATTENTION! whatever building your reading 
this from all Global nation buildings have silent alarms that are triggered very 
easily. No doubt a alarm has been triggered and there sending an Army after you as 
it is. they will most likely rearange alot of obsticales in your way and use it to 
there advantage. Becareful. whatever city your in take a Aircraft and head to the 
Cyro Airport. Sadly the Cyro Building  1 & 2 has become the bridge so no doubt will 
be heavily guarded. Escape the birdge and work your way to our secret base in Cyro 
city. when you get there  you will have to find our underground base. our underground 
base entrance is right outside the Cryo airport building.. just find the secret elevator 
in the bar across the street and take it down to the sewers and show the man waiting 
for you this data pad. From there on he will tell you what to do. I hope this works. 
Goodluck to you stranger i hope you will sucseed where i can not. -Thomas Drakes


  The Hologram turns off.  You quickly remove it from the computer and hear the door 
down the hall slam shut. You quickly turn the machines off and grab your gun. 

Robert: Hmm.. there comming for me. better be careful. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Level 3

   Crythex Hospital Mainframe Sector

 The Military has no doubt arrived and are beginning to set up posts and obsitcles 
to get in your way. Get back up to the lobby.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 4

  Crythex Hospital Escape

You have reached the lobby again and it seems they have done some remodeling. Not 
for the better however. alot of things have been destroyed and they set up posts 
and there trying to seal you in. work your way to the front door and leave the hospital.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Robert steals the small convoy airlift and drives off away from the hospital in 
a hurry. Robert drives back to his home. He runs in grabs as much gear as he can 
and begins to pack it into a large bag as quick as possible. Robert then grabs some 
extra ammo for his pistol incase he might need it. He checks his weapons and grabs 
his bag and heads to the city airport. he then steals a shuttle and takes it to the 
Cyro Airport.  The ship lands and  Robert prepares his guns. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 5

   Cyro Airport

You must work your way to the lobby of the airport. This is the old building that 
Thomas used to work in. As you looking around this entire airport seems to look like 
some kind of bridge. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Level 6

   Cyro Airport Control Center

 you seemed to have landed at the Cyro building bridge and now your inside the bridge 
control center but now its a AIR traffic control center. anyway. there is a side 
entrance that leads out side.  work your way out there and get to that bar and take 
the elevator down to the secret hideout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Robert runs out of the building as he sees 2 military personel chasing him.  Robert 
quickly  dives to the ground and shoots them. Robert kills them both and lands infront 
of the bar.   Robert stands up cleans himself up and walks into the bar. The bar 
seems quite dark and all the stools are ontop of the tables. it seems to have been 
long abanadoned. Robert searches the place and sees a secret door behind the bar 
table. Robert heads over and opens the secret door and walks down a short hall way 
to a secret elevator. Robert is about to step in when he sees small air vents in 
the elevator. he looks around and sees a camera watching him. Robert decides to wave 
the Data pad before entering the elevator.  after robert has waved the Data pad he 
then proceeds into the elevator and takes it down.  The elevator door opens 2 guards 
stand infront of the elevator and a strange man with an eye patch awaiting him. Robert 
takes a step closer.

 ???: So, your the one who finnaly cought Kraalon. Well its about time. As you know 
you are to  become our new leader. As our leader we will follow you into battle and 
we will stop Global nations anyway we can ..  and Crythex.

Robert: Look pal. I dont know who you are, where you came from but because of you 
guys i am now in hell and i have Crythex Security  and Crythex armed forces on my 
ass trying to kill me!   I am not happy to see you! for that fact Im not happy im 
even here! I just want my life back

???:  SILENCE!  this is no game Robert Gyn. Thomas Drakes a scientist who worked 
in those Cyro buildings as you see there across the street was arreseted for working 
on a project. He didnt even know what the project was. he didnt even know it was 
above his level. He just continued to work on it. The Global nations found out about 
this and could not let a Level 3 scientist know about there secret opertions that 
involve aliens. So they had him arrested. In the cell was another scientist who found 
out what Thomas did. Thomas found his journal and found out that the Global nations 
is planning to use these alein creatures to create a massive strike on us.  However 
they were going to use mind control to keep the aliens in line. global nations researchers 
 claim the aliens seem to be very simple minded. even dumber then us humans. Making 
it easy for the Global nations to  control them. We have encountered these aliens 
many times. However we have just learned recently that that there are only 2 actual 
aliens. The rest are just clones.  we also realized that the clones cant be used 
to make more clones. according to Crythex it will cause some sort of genetic mutation 
and not only destroy there systems but also cause the nuclear reactor to explode. 
if we can kill these 2 aliens and get rid of them we can then wipe out the rest of 
them and nto have to worry about any more of them constantly comming trying to destroy 
us.

 Robert: thats great and how do you expect me to do any of this might i ask?

???: LOOK! .. we have enough jobs to do .. everyone has a job and untill you understand 
your role your going to do as i say and help us. Other wise you can have us hunt 
you down along with your friends back and Crythex. so make your desicion now!

Robert: Alright alright ill do it.  one thing. Whats your name?

???: Just call me Zeen. Listen. get back into the Cyro building and get to the top 
floor of building 2. They ship some kind of crap  there to the Genetics cloning facility. 
 await for the shuttles arrival then try to sneak on  board. dont kill the pilot 
however and dont let them see you sneak on the ship. Otherwise they wont fly you 
to the  Cloning labs.  Your a police officer. or so you used to be. im sure you can 
make good use of stealth. Well good luck to you. i have enough work to worry about. 
when you complete your mission meet me at Sector 15 of Cyro city.

Robert: Understood.  Ill see you then Zeen.

 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Level 7

   Cyro Building 2 Shipping Sector

  You must find a way to kill the guards without alarming everyone in the base. Once 
you get near the ship you must find a way to sneak on. Firing your weapons will only 
cause havoc then you will never be able to get to the  Cloneing facility. Good luck.


 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Level 8

   Crythex Genetics Center.

  You have made your way onto the ship and it has left Cyro station and took you 
to the Crythex Genetics Center. Here at the center Zeen has told you about the main 
genetic lab where the cloning an alien. Find your way to the main genetic lab.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Level 9

   Crythex Genetics Center.

  The elevator is taking you to the main genetic lab. You load your weapons. This 
is it. The Alien must be here. Find your way to the chamber the alien is held in 
and kill it. Once you have killed it find a way to escape the facility. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



   Robert walks through a large forest as he tries to find his way back to Cyro city. 
After a long five hours pass Robert finnaly makes his way into the city and heads 
for sector 15. you look around sector 15 but you cant seem to find him. you turn 
around and see 2 speeding hover ships with loud sirens speeding towards you. you 
run into the ally way hiding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 10

   Cyro city sector 15

  It seems you have fallen into a trap.. find a way to escape sector 15 before its 
too late.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 11

   Cyro city sector 15

 You managed to get through the small courtyard and through the apartment building. 
However now your in some office building. sector 15 must be highly secure, the enemy 
is trying to cut you off.  You must find a way out of sector 15. All main street 
exits will be closed. There has to be some way out.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 12

   Cyro city sector 15

 You managed to find a ventalation system that lead you back to the surface level 
inside another building. However they had the main street closed. Clueless as to 
where you are in the entire sector all you do knwo is that you located the Crythex 
Security building. This is no time to mess around. find a way out of the building 
and head for the city subway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 13

   Cyro City Sector 15 ( Subway )

As you enter the subway you see zeen firing then he runs. Just as you move forward 
you see 2 Global nations army men run past the door way. Zeen was waiting for you 
and the enemy must of saw this as an opportunity to try and capture you both. Look 
around the subway find some way out of Sector 15. Then Locate Zeen and get out of 
there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Robert hits the switch as the door opens robert walks out into the tracks.  Robert 
walks down to his right and continues walking till he sees waiting area for the train. 
 As Robert looks at the tracks he sees Zeen tied down by these restraning feilds. 
Robert runs to Zeen and quicky tries to find a way to deactivate the device holding 
Zeen down.

Zeen: huh what?! .. ROBERT! ..   NO .. GET OUT OF HERE ITS A TRAP!! GET OUT OF HERE 
NOW!! ..

Robert: Shut up .. im not leaving you here.

A large train roar is heard as it gets louder and faster.

Zeen: You cant deactivate te Restraining device ... its set by a password .. you 
must get out of here before its too LATE !

Robert: SHUSH! I CAN DO THIS! 

Zeen: YOUR GONNA GET US BOTH KILLED. MY TIME IS UP! I DID WHAT I COULD FROM HAVING 
THEM CAPTURE YOU! DONT LET ALL THE WORK IVE DONE BECOME USLESS!  GOOO!!!!

The train is seen speeding towards them.  Robert quickly jumps off the track and 
begins to run for the stairs. Robert hears the train roaring as it begins to slow 
down. Robert sees tons of soldiers running down the stairs towards him .. he quickly 
starts blasting them. As he is blasting them he realizes there are so many comming 
down the staircase at once.robert starts to back up and hears the train doors open. 
 

Soldiers: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! .. DONT MOVE! 

An officer in gray walks out 

Officer: All Men .. Positions Forward Face!

All the soldiers quickly react to what the officer says.
The officer walks back to the side of the train door and folds his hands behind his 
back. A suited man walks out and stands behind you.

???:  Ahh Robert Robert Robert. What am i going to do with you Robert.

Robert:  Let me guess. Your going to execute me with this squad?

???:  HAH! that is quite ammusing i must admit but no ... unfortinatly the orders 
i have are quite diffrent.  Robert you made a great cop and now i see you would of 
made a great soldier. It is a shame to see however your working for the wrong side. 
 Turn around robert.

Robert slowly turns to face the man.

Robert: What?! ..  YOU! ..  YO ...   ( gets cut off )
???: Yes .. Robert me.. along time back i remember a man comming into the Willow 
tree bar ..   quite fustrated. I felt terrible so i bought that man a drink. He was 
kind and thanked me. Then he told me how he always wanted  to be a cop and how he 
just got back from his long interveiw with the police chief.  So here i thought this 
man could be good. So i went back to my office late that night made the phone call 
making sure a man named Robert would get that job he wanted. But for what ..   you 
manage to so kindly use your skills to backstabb me?! ..  

Robert: You dont .. ( gets cut off again ) 

???: Enough talk ..  get on board the train Robert .. we will discuss things further 
there.

Robert and the suited man get on the train and so does the officer.

Officer: All men back to stations. Re-open Sector 15 our mission objective is complete 
here. 

The train door closes and begins to move again.   the officer walks his way to the 
meeting room on the train.

???: Officer you have done a spectacular job but ..  i also know that General Hoff 
thinks im not capable of taking care of things. Well thats where were going to prove 
him wrong!   Guard .. if you please!

The Crythex Guard pulls out his pistol and blasts the officer killing him.

???: Now lets discuss real business shall we?  before we do maybe i should introduce 
my self seeing as how i never did so long ago. My name is Sabashtian Crythex. Leader 
of Crythex corp and one of the leaders who ran Global nations.  However things got 
terrible.  A scientist named Thomas Drakes found out all about a plan working with 
aliens. However me and the council had no idea of this. So after Thomas Drakes made 
his escape he started his so called revolution and so we all decided to send General 
Hoff to assess the situation. Biggest mistake we  could of ever made or so i finnaly 
realize. General Hoff did everything in his power to make the threat seem more serius 
then it was. He Accomplished his task. He made his own revolution to take over .. 
the government.  I found out about and i was ordered to stop it. However i did not 
do so well i almost ended up dead. So i made a deal to work with General Hoff. General 
Hoff killed everyone in charge of Global Nations and took charge for himself.   


Robert: How do i know your not lying?

Sabashtian Crythex:  Please .. Robert .. just listen. General Hoff took over and 
so he allowed me to go through with my plans to open up Crythex Corperation. However 
i still had to follow orders and do things for the General but also i had a small 
group of men leave weapons and ammuntion and data letting them know what to expect 
and what to do. However i had to sacrafice poor Zeen to keep you safe.  Zeen was 
a good man. I will miss him. Getting back on subject.  Now please pay attention. 
  According to General Hoff the resistance has become quite more powerful since your 
wonderful strike at the genetics facility. So General Hoff is planning to board his 
ship the Nova .. and fly out into space for awhile as a security measure.  This train 
is headed to the Nova Docking base.  Ive seen what your capable of. Your going to 
get off this train get on the Nova and stop General Hoff.

Robert: AND DIE LIKE YOU KILLED DRAKE?!

Sabashtian Crythex: No .. your more capable .. i know you can handle your self well 
in heavy areas. You must do this. If you kill General Hoff i will gain control again 
and i could bring peace to you all.    Ive done you a favor Robert .. all i ask is 
that you return a favor to me.

Robert: I understand but ... this is just all hard for me. Im still not sure if i 
trust you or not.

Sabashtian Crythex: I know this is all hard for you and i understand. these things 
are hard to handle but you must believe me. Robert... this isnt a movie..  this is 
a real life situation. sometimes you have to be the bad guy in order to be the good 
guy robert.  Robert i hired you from the beginning knowing  you could help. ive seen 
all the trouble you have caused in the past i also know about all the strength you 
built in your self. Please Robert ..   were probrably almost there now ..   we must 
get through this.   

Robert: Ok ..  i agree.. but if this is some sort of trick i promise you i will be 
back for you.

Sabashtian Crythex:  I promise you freedom. Ok listen this train is going to stop 
at the train cargo Depot .. at the docking base. Work your way to the court yard 
and work your way into the Docking facility then board the Nova before it leaves. 
You should becareful though the place is filled with those Alien Slave units. Or 
so the General calls them that. When the train stops one of our men is going to bring 
you to the prison center. He will then give you your weapons and walk out and forget 
to lock the door. You then begin your mission from there.  Good luck to you Robert. 
I hope you can bring peace to our troubled planet.

 As Robert activates the switch he sees the floor starting to break apart.  Robert 
quickly runs to the door he stares at the ship and sees a large opening at the bottom 
of the ship.  Robert jumps down. As  he tries to land in the opening his guns fly 
 out of his backpack.   

Robert: DAMN! 

Robert manages to grab his pistol.  Robert Quickly grabs on to the very bottom. Robert 
climbs aboard and sees ships landed on his left and right.  Robert looks around and 
sees a Force feild activate behind him.  Robert looks down as he can see half of 
the base.   Robert looks around and loads his pistol with a new clip. 

???:  He might be on the ship!   We are on full alert!  Keep all sectors of the ship 
secure and lock down all  Passage way doors.  We will not let him get any further 
then he has already!

General Hoff:  Right after you take care of me i suppose? 

Robert:  Thats right!

General Hoff: Well thats too bad especially since your right in the room where i 
can activate my favorite device.   I like to call it the Nova Shadow.  You see what 
it does it forms a shadow of the person who stands at the center console then it 
will scan them and make a replicated  copy of the person a holographic form.  then 
the nova central computer tells these holographic shadows to track down the  man 
who has been replicated.  These holographs are made out of  laser particles broken 
down.  So if you touch one of them you will be burned  to a nice warm crisp.  Have 
fun my little friend.
