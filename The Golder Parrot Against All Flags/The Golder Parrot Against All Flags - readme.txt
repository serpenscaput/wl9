Description             : Pirate themed Wolfenstein 3D mod
==============================================================

The Golden Parrot: Against All Flags is a pirate-themed game based on the Wolfenstein 3D engine.

The hero, a privateer, decides to go against all flags after a disagreement with his government. 
He establishes a hideout in order to prepare his future raids against the packs of rival pirates 
and imperial soldiers in a fantasy world. While most of the areas are dedicated to combat, 
there is a nice adventure and RPG touch enabling the hero to develop his skills and rewarding 
exploration with secrets and treasures.

Story
=====

In the year 1717, the new world is ravaged by a malediction. While the major european empires fight for supremacy in the West Indies, Skulleye, a skull-headed man, rises an army of monsters. You are sent by your colony to mitigate piracy and disturbances against the commercial activities in this area, however you slowly drift away from your original design and become a pirate yourself and seize the treasures, relic and other artifacts present on this side of the world.


Circa 1681:
Hendrik van Horn was born in South Africa from dutch colons. His parents, Gertruid and Adam, are a young couple who take at Rotterdam, a ship bound to Cape Town to escape poverty. They establish a business there starting with a farm. After a few months they have grown a comfortable life and quickly become arrogant with the local indigenous peoples employed there. The village where they reside is not well protected by the dutch soldier and the colonial authority is fragile.

1685:
Eventually, it leads to a revolt. Like most of the inhabitants, Gertruid and Adam do not survive. The domain is set on fire, and the village is taken over. Hendrik who was hidden in a barrel is found by the rebels. Because of his young age, they spare his life and adopt him. The child, which is now 4 years old, behaves strangely and doesn't cooperate easily with his new family. He is confided to a sorcerer in order to deliver his soul from its evil side, but the success of the operation doesn't appear to be obvious.

1688:
Despite the unpleasant situation for the dutch settlers, the village remains in control of the local tribe for a couple of years. Soon enough though, the dutch colony in South Africa expends and the economical stakes become more important. Part of a massive military reinforcement operation, several Man of War full of soldiers arrive from the Netherlands. The village is easily invaded and the locals are captured. Most of them, Hendrick included, are put in a slave ship bound to West Indies in order to be sold.

The conditions on board are difficult and the military escort is granted in a cheap way. If the casualties made by a first storm allow a greater piece of supply per headcount, over time the situation degrades with the prisoners dying faster than their keepers and letting them with more and more workload to maneuver the ship.

Just before reaching its destination at Curaçao the ship got chased by pirates. She is finally captured after a pursuit of a couple of hours. The Dutch are mostly killed during the boarding. The survivors and prisoners are offered to join the pirate crew. Hendrik therefore joins them and grow in their company before becoming a ship boy and learning the basics of navigation, and piracy.

1694:
In order to remain unnoticed they don't take a lot of prizes, and live as much as possible, in land, hidden in a forest in the Caracas area in a modest but rather happy life. This is where, years later, exploring the ruins Hendrik finds a powerful artifact. Over time, he learns how to use it, unsure if a part of the power comes from him... His magical power grows while his physical appearance gets closer to a dead man. He starts to get rid of rival fellows and plundering villages.

1698:
The panic spreads and the security is reinforced against the "Skulleye" threat. Nickname given after he seemed to have launched a fireball with a glow in his eye on his bone head.

1701:
The story becomes known and the most important empires start researches about the origin of the magic in order to also benefit from it.

1703:
Adventurers and merchants flourish pretending to have artifacts in stock. Which is mostly fake but the need for protection and the demand around it boosts the mechanical and technological progresses.

1707:
An armored gorilla is seen on a battlefield in the surroundings of Belize.

1717 [events depicted in The Golden Parrot original game]:
You arrive in the West Indies and vanquishes notorious pirates such as Blackbeard and Anne Bonny. A few months later you even fight with Skulleye and neutralize him. However the chaos remains and government takes that excuse to disallow you the agreed reward.

1719 [events depicted in The Golden Parrot: Against All Flags]:
You haven't returned to Europe. You have established your own hideout where you live and use it as a base to prepare the next raids. You now sail against all flags...

As you feel the salty wind teasing your ears
You smell like a powder flavour in the air
Will you take your sword first
Just to satisfy your blood thirst
Will you stand hidden in the fog
Waiting till the end of the storm
The bottle of rhum is empty
It is the sign you are ready

Yaaarrrr!

Gameplay info
=============

*Nation bonus
-------------
English - magic oriented: gains +1 mana per potion, +5 mana per holy chalice, +15 to maximum mana
Spanish - defense oriented: -1 damage taken from every source
French - fortune oriented: dodging chances increased by 5%, steal chances increased by 5%
Dutch - attack oriented: +5 damage to close attack
Portuguese - economy oriented: 10% price reduction on skills
Swedish - firearms oriented: faster firearms and cannon reloading


*Weapon expertise
-----------------
When you reach 100 and 300 kills milestones with a given weapon,
you get a damages bonus for it. It is symbilized with one or two 
stars in the Weapon Expertises screen. 

In the particular case of the hook,
the expertise gives in addition +6% chances of sucess when stealing.
A successful theft also increases the expertise.


*Destructible objects
---------------------
Some crates and barrels are destructible. Hit them with any weapon to break them.
Crates can contain useful goods. Barrels don't contain anything (but can free a passage).
Explosive barrels explode and damage surrounding enemies and objects.

Cracked walls and columns can be destructed with a grenade or cannon shot only.


*Moveable objects
-----------------
You can also move above mentioned crates and barrels with the "Push" skill (number 95).
Use the spacebar to push.
Use the secondary attack of the hook weapon to pull.

Pulling is more difficult you need to let a bit of space between you and the object 
and walk backward at the same time.

This can be useful to block a passage for the enemy or place an explosive barrel at 
a strategic position.


=======
Enemies
=======

Numerous enemies will challenge you during your journey but two of them are particular: 
-Ghosts can only be killed with magical damage (holy chalice, parrot)
-Sharks can only be killed with physical damage (all melee weapons and firearms)


===========
The hideout
===========

Sometimes at the end of the level you can speak to a ferryman, an allied agent 
who can bring you to your hideout, before starting the next level.

In there you have a marchant available and some areas to unlock represented by 
locked doors. The skills 86 to 89 will give you the corresponding keys for the 
current stop (in case you buy them at the merchant located on site) and all the next 
passages as well.

Inside the locked areas you can find some welcome supplies and other non playable characters:
-The weaponmaster in the inn lets you define your favorite weapon you can then access with the F key
-The blacksmith in the forge can fabricate a customized handle for your cutlass
-The smuggler in the warehouse near the woods offers and bid artifacts


===================
Merchant and skills
===================
You can buy materials and acquire knowledge at the merchants in order to get new aptitudes and powers.
Enter the skill number you want to buy when prompted. You need to have enough gold and possible
other prerequired skills.

The number 0 allows to sell your extra goods. This consists in
relics, silk and duplicate weapons you might have found.

If you buy nothing, leaving the prompt empty, it will automatically sell what you have,
which is fine because there is nothing else you can do with these extra goods.
