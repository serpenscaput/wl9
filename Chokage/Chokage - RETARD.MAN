Echo "I'll pay for the ice cream!". You walk up to the ice cream man & ask for 
Echo a Super Huge Chocolate filled Drumstick. "Buff, that thing costs six bucks!" 

Echo yells Arnold. You laugh at him "Ha, Sucker!". Later, the ice cream man trips

Echo and falls in a culvert. The PERFECT oppertunity to pig out. You and Arnold
Echo grab all the popsicles in his bike-box combo thing and run away. The ice
Echo cream man recovers from the fall and starts running after you guys. Your

Echo   Ralph brings you into... the surgery room. He asks you "What in God's name

Echo happend to you? When you were born, did the doctor drop you on wet cement!"

Echo.
Echo YOU:   "Ya, how'd you know?"
Echo RALPH: "Ummm... no apparent reason."
Echo YOU:   "You sound just like your father."
Echo RALPH: "How would you know, you barely know him?"
Echo YOU:   "Ummm... no apparent reason."
Echo.
Echo   While Ralph is doing surgery on you, you had a dream about YOU being
Echo beautiful. It was the best dream of your life.
Echo.

Echo   You go look in the mirror, and tell him what you think of your NEW face,
Echo "You jerk, I'm even Uglier than before!"
Echo "THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, how can you be any uglier than BEFORE???" he asks.
Echo "Look at me, I'm a discrace!" you say.
Echo "Well... to tell you the truth, I don't see any difference!" he admits.
Echo.

Echo   this is hopeless, stupid Mother had to drop me on Wet Cement,' you think
Echo.

Echo.
Echo  "AAAAAAA!!!! Oh my God you scared me" God shrieks, "wasn't halloween over
Echo   about 6 months ago?".
Echo.
Echo   God quickly turns you into a spirit so you won't be ugly anymore. You think

Echo to yourself 'WOW!!! THIS IS WONDERFUL!!! I'M GONNA BE JUST LIKE EVERYONE 
Echo ELSE!'....
