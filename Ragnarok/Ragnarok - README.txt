Thank you for downloading these 30 new Wolf3d levels.
The Ragnarok levels replace the first three episodes (with ten levels in each)
in the Wolf3D registered version. The zipped package includes three files: 
GAMEMAPS.WL6, and MAPHEAD.WL6., and README.txt.

The new levels follow the style of the original Wolf3D levels in that they feature 

varied and, I hope, interesting layouts. No new sound or new graphic is included; 

it is hard to beat the great professional graphics by iD. 

Episode1/level1 and Episode3/level1 are based on the original iD levels, all 
other levels are new. Episodes 4 and 5 were disabled to make the file smaller and 

also to let you know when the Ragnarok maps are finished. In the disabled levels 

the action and the image are frozen. (Episode 6 is still playable.)

Sorry, but there is no use playing at the highest difficulty (Death Incarnate) 
grade as no guards were placed for this difficulty grade.

HOW to play:
To play the new levels the two Ragnarok files, Gamemaps.wl6 and Maphead.wl6, need 

to be substituted for the files with same name in the original registered version.

For those who are new to this, it is easiest to make a new copy of the original game 

with all its files, then to rename it and copy into this folder the Ragnarok files. 

OR else work with the original game folder but save and save in some other folder 

the original gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.wl6 files, and then copy the two new Ragnarok 

files into the original folder.
