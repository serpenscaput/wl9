WLFbel2.ZIP - by Brian E. Lowe
Sixty new levels for the full 60 level registered set of Wolfenstein 3D
(PC and Acorn/Archimedes version)

Firstly, my thanks to all those who contributed to the original Wolf3D, and its  
map editor.  Also to RISC USER of St. Albans, England, who made the Acorn version 
available again.  (This time without having to insert the diskette).

WLFbel2.ZIP contains 3 files GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6, plus this document file 
WLFbel2.DOC.

Users may freely distribute these 3 files (or the ZIP file),  on a non-profit basis. 
 However, please do not distribute them (or the ZIP file), with any other files. 
 Users must have the original Wolf3D 60 level set to play this set.

These levels should be played with the original VSWAP.WL6 file.  Acorn/Archimedes 
users can get this from my first WolfBel set
I didn't alter any of the objects/walls etc.  I find one of the reasons that the 
game is so compelling is the atmosphere of the Nazi era.  (Now that it's gone, that 
is.  It obviously wasn't very nice at the time). 
All new secret doors are obvious.  (eg, a Hitler portrait, an alcove, or a space 
between 2 plants etc).  
 
Acorn/Archimedes users may be aware of bugs in previous alternate level sets.  Passages 
which get blocked off - walls which disappear.  Sometimes a level wouldn't play at 
all.  All these levels have been tested on an Acorn 3010 and play OK.
