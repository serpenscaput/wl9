As Helga Von Klaus breaths her last, you go through her body armor looking for something, 
anything to point you to your next location.

You discover a small book printed by a Dr. Schneider in German and you know it is 
of importance. Your German is rusty, but you pick up the words "Nacht Rose" from 
the pages.

It seems that Dr.Schneider's lair was in Castle Totenstein...How appropriate...Toten, 
in German, means Death.
