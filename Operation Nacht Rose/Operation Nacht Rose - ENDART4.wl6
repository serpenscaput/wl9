^C7eDR. SCHNEIDER IS DEAD!
^C00
Dr. Schneider lays dead at your feet and you breath a sigh of relief. The threat 
is now over and you no longer have to worry about the enemies
coming back.
Your lean against the wall and it slides open as you sprang a hidden
passage. You peer down it and throw your chain gun aside. You may need it or not. 
Something was down there and you are going to find out!
