Put your map wads into the Maps folder, to
be referenced by MAPINFO.

INSTRUCTIONS:

A: The Hard Way

	1. Make your map in WDC, save and compile.

	2. Select Import/Export and then select Export to File

	3. Save your map as PLANES.map

	4. Make a new WAD archive in SLADE3

	5. Make a new entry (the document icon with an E) and
		name it whatever you want to call the map
		(I usually follow MAPXX but you can call it anything
		8 or less characters)
		
	6. Import PLANES.map
	
	7. Save your wad as the same name as your header entry
		(example MAP01.wad)
		
	8. Import your saved wad into the Maps folder of this
		pk3.
	
	9. Make your MAPINFO def in mapinfo.txt!  Example MAPINFO def:
	
		map "MAP01" //(MAP01 is your WAD's file name)
			{
			next = "MAP02" //(File name of the next map wad)
			secretnext = "MAP10" //(Same, but for the secret map)
			floornumber = 1 //(Floor number to display on the status bar)
			par = 90 //(Par time, measured in seconds)
			music = "GETTHEM" //(Level music, type the lump file name here)
			cluster = 1 // Cluster number, refer to ECWolf wiki for more info
			}
		
		(These are only basic options, there's much more you can do
		in MAPINFO, go to the ECWolf wiki, the LZWolf wiki on bitbucket
		or open up an existing mod for more information.)
		
	10. Test your map, and move on to the next!
	
B: The Easy Way

	1. Make your map in WDC, save and compile.
	
	2. Select File and then select Export to WAD/PK3/PK7
	
	3. Click on the icon with 2 dots next to the bar 
		labeled "Lump Name File"
		
	4. Select "wl6map.txt" (included with this toolkit)
	
	5. Check the box next to the map you want to export.
		You are able to extract more than one map at once,
		but when WADs are read from within a pk3 it will 
		ignore all of the maps except the first one, so it
		is best to export one at a time.
		
	6. Press the Export button, make sure that WAD format
		is selected.  Save as anything, but remember to
		keep it 8 characters or below.  I prefer MAPXX.wad.
		
	7. Follow Steps 8-10 of the Hard Way
