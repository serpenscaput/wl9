All graphics that are not sprites or textures get dumped
into the graphics folder.  If they need to be scaled, you can do so
in the textures lump, or by putting them in a folder called
"hires".  the hires folder method will auto-scale the graphic;
the textures lump method is a bit harder, but you have greater
control over the scaling.

Example Texture Definition (must be put into textures.txt
in the root!):

Graphic FONTN048, 16, 32
{
	XScale 2.000
	YScale 2.000
	Patch FONTN048, 0, 0
}
