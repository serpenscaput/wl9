These are where you put your sprites - enemies, pickups, statics,
actors of any sort.  Be sure to set the offsets properly!  If
you are using a 64x64 sprite, the offsets are x32,y64.  The
bottom of the sprite image (or where the sprite touches the
ground, if there is transparent space at the bottom) should
align with the horizontal guide line in SLADE.

You can also scale sprites in the textures lump, using the 
hires folder method, or by using the scale function in the
individial actor's DECORATE definition.

Textures Lump example

	Sprite Optional SPRTA0, 256, 256
		{
		XScale 2
		YScale 2
		Offset 256, 256
		Patch SPRTA0, 0, 0
		}
		
DECORATE actor example

	actor ScaledTrans : Trans 
		{
		scale .5
		}
