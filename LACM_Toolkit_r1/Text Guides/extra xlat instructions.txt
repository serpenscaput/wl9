If you wish to use an alternate xlat for your map
submission, please follow these basic guidelines:

1. Reference the original XLAT!  This is REQUIRED
in order for the map not to crash!  Put this at
the top of your XLAT:

	include "xlat/astrokit.txt"
	
	
2. When adding new actor/wall tiles, start 
in the 1000 range please. This will ensure no new
tiles will overwrite prior base tiles.

	EXAMPLE:
		{1000, SchmonicDeHedjhawg,              0, 0, 0}
		
3. Keep it simple, stupid!  It's hard to find errors when
an XLAT/Decorate script is messy!  Try to keep your
tile numbers in order, and generally neat formatting.
