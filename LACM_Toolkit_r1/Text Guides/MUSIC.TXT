As a bonus, I included the MacWolf and SOD
tracks, as well as Blake Stone/Planet Strike
and ROTT tracks.  Simply reference the 
music lump name in the map definition in your
MAPINFO file.

Any custom music you want to use should be tossed
into the Music folder.

(Side note, OGG and tracker music
can be used instead of IMF as well, just put those in the music
folder. MIDI can also now be used without 
errors, as the MIDItoOPL code from Noah was
recently ported to ECWolf/LZWolf)

For this project I would prefer IMF, MID, or
MOD format music to be used, as they are low
in memory, OGG can make this project pretty
hefty very quickly lol.
