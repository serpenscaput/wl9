The Astrostein ECWolf/LZWolf Toolkit
designed for the LZWolf Astrostein Community Mapset
2020 AstroCreep

This is a simple ECWolf/LZWolf toolkit for
use with SLADE and WDC, designed for
the impending LACM (LZWolf Astrostein Community Mapset)
this time coming in Astrostein flavor! 
This includes this pk3 file, complete with 
new actors, textures and more, 
as well as a WMC tile definition 
file for use with WDC.  

For the most part, this is based off of what
(I imagine) a proper DOS port of the original
Astrostein would have been, using rescaled
Mac textures and static sprites, as well as
the enemy sprites featured in WolfenDOOM rather
than the original terribly scaled Bruce Ryder
graphics.  Furthermore this does include
a few ECWolf specific features (namely
remote-activated triggers and elevators)
as well as a couple re-imagined boss actors.

Basic Instructions:

1. Set up your WDC project - set your base data
	folder to your vanilla Wolf3D folder, your
	extension to WL6, your output folder to a blank
	folder of your choosing, and the map data file
	to "astrokit.wmc" (included with this toolkit)
	Go to Maximum Values and change the Map Planes to 4
	if you wish to use the 4th Plane (switch tagging and 
	other ECWolf specific features)
	
2. Make your map and save.  Export your map to WAD.
	You can do this manually by exporting your map
	to regular WDC format as PLANES.map and injecting
	into a WAD (look at the demo map for an
	example), or you can use the WAD exporter
	(requires wl6map.txt, included with this
	toolkit)  Refer to Dunkel's tutorial videos
	for detailed instructions, or the guide in the MAPS folder 
	(link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEO6fIn0VP8&list=PL-rUi0n65Qjx3tSauvU-6cglX13v0VKQm)
	
3. Dump your new map WAD file into the "Maps" folder
	of this PK3.  Remember to make your definition
	in mapinfo.txt!  Repeat steps 2-3 for each map
	
4. Play that shit!

This is a quasi-vanilla themed kit, so no extra
EC/LZ features such as flats, parallax skies,
halo lighting, brightness or any other fancy bells
and whistles are included. However they can very 
EASILY be added to this pk3.  Refer to the ECWolf
tutorial page on Wolfsource, the LZWolf wiki on
bitbucket, or simply tear apart any of my mods
to see how its all done!

These are indeed only basic guidelines, and the
included scripts/defs can easily be modified
within SLADE and WDC!  Feel free to add things
such as light levels, parallax skies and flats
to create a completely new experience!

SUBMISSIONS:

	If you make a map with only the included assets,
simply send me the Map Wad file and I can handle
the rest, as long as you provide me with proper
details such as music selection, par time,
and ceiling/floor color selection 

	If your map contains new custom assets 
I would prefer you to package your new map in
pk3 format, arranged in the same way as this
toolkit - if you have new sprites/sounds/
scripts/whatever, please put them in a folder
with your name

	EXAMPLE:
		/sprites/astrocreep/
		/actors/astrocreep/
		etc
	
	Remember to make a new XLAT file!
	Refer to the instructions in the XLAT folder.

	Please design your map for pistol start and
with no secret exits, maps will be accessed
from a central hub map, much like the prior
community mapset.  You can name the map
wad whatever you like, as I will be arranging
the maps in a logical fashion so the 
teleport triggers function properly.

FEATURES:

*Analogs of most Astrostein enemies, including
	all foot guards, most robots and bosses.
	Some robots have different functions than
	before, i.e. the Alarm Drone and the
	Suicide Robot, which were originally
	variations of Ubermutant and the Dog
	respectively.
*All vanilla Mac Astrostein static actors,
	rescaled to x64, plus a few extras from
	WolfenDOOM
*All weapons featured from the original MacWolf
	Astrostein, based off of the vanilla weapons
	and Executor's Second Encounter PC Style
	weapons.  I even kept the goofy out of place
	knife, lol.
*ALMOST all textures from the Mac Astrostein
	scenarios, resized to x64 and cleaned up
*A few re-imagined boss actors, inspired by
	original bosses from the MacWolf Astrosteins
	as well as Spifferaneous' version.
		-Colonel Welder, 2 stage boss, based off of
			Mecha Hitler, sprites by Spifferaneous
		-Karl and Franz Grosse, basically the same
			as each other, simple Grosse replacements
			that drop either a gold or blue key
		-RoboSchabbs, inspired by Spifferaneous'
			original version, shoots Photons
			sprites by AstroCreep
		-RoboHitler, multi-stage boss, first
		is spawn, second is stationary with
		no attacks, third is a "flying" stage
		with photon and plasma attacks, fourth
		is the "death loop".  Inspired by original
		RoboHitler from Astrostein 3.  
		Sprites by AstroCreep
*An assload of extra music from SOD, MacWolf,
Blake, PS and ROTT
