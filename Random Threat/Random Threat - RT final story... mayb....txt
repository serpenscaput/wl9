You are Lax Antaries, a 26 year old male from the United States of America. You're 
an ex-Navy SEAL, who has now been upgraded to a high position at the RTES; Random 
Threat Eliminator Squad. You have been selected for a special team of RT. You wonder 
what is so "Special", about this team compared to any other Squad. You know your 
mission, but remind yourself every detail everynight since you were assigned the 
mission four nights ago. Assassinate Yuri Romanov, a Russian Drug Baron accused of 
putting a price on the President of the United States of America's head. Simply run 
in and kill a hundred attackers then frag Yuri at the top somewhere without letting 
him escape on the helipads. Delta snipers will cover the roof, along with half of 
Lax's squad. "Tomorrow, tommorow night, my fate will be decided. Die, or stay alive." 
said Lax with a sigh. He lies down on his bed and closes his eyes thinking about 
what his new squad would look like. Now that he had been upgraded, he expected them 
all to be mucho men and women, that knew how to shoot enemies behind them while punching 
people hopping on one foot, picking their nose. They would be elite! This would be 
perfect...
	
Lax snaps open his eyes and thrusts out his arm at the looming shadow over the top 
of him. He grabs hold of the sudden threat's wrist and slams his foot down on their 
body. Quickly, he throws open the blinds to let in the warm sunlight, and reveal 
his opponent. To his surprise it's his best friend Ceiko. He releases his grip from 
her and blushes. "Sorry Ceiko, bad dream I guess." said Lax, "That's okay dude," 
she rolls over and makes a sideflip upwards. She walks toward him then pushes him 
onto the bed hard. "I guess I had that coming, eh?" said Lax. Ceiko's lips spread 
into a seductive smile. "Get up now, we need to be in the mission briefing room, 
or the general will gouge out our eyes or something involving our excrutiating death." 
Ordered Ceiko "I think I’ll have a shower now," Lax says as he gets up with Ceiko's 
arms clinging to him.
	The impromtue Briefing room is tight, and the occupants are the worst of the worst. 
That’s exactly what the RT Generals pay them for. Yasma is seated on the far end, 
she is a sleek Shaolin assassin who is self taught in tiger claw kung-fu, kali knife 
fighting among other deadly martial arts, along with sharp shooting skills. Zygot 
is perched beside her, his skin is as dark as leather, and he is covered from head 
to toe with gashes and wounds. Regarded by many as a war junkie, Zygot never met 
a pile of ammunition he couldn’t waste in under 2 hours! He was dishonorably discharged 
for his massacre of 13 allied soldiers with two MAC10 Uzi weapons, that was why he 
was here. Ryder, Zygot’s seat mate, is seen picking his breakfast from his teeth with 
a dagger. He has a mucho build, and a smart mouth; He's pretty much Zygot's clone. 
He was sent to the RT becasue he had violent tendencies. Finally, lounging at the 
end with his arm hanging on the corner of the chair is Jatom. His frizzy hair covers 
his expressionless face. No one knows too much about Jatom, his life was a mystery 
to all. He was a caring man though, always worrying for people, he was their second 
mom. Ceiko and Lax approach their chairs but are stopped by the booming "SHUT UP 
and listen!"
	General Sorkan strides into the room clutching a steaming hot Coffee in one hand. 
"All of you are total losers and would be dead if it weren't for me, so you owe your 
country for your stupidity and you owe me. You were all chosen for your criminalistic 
attributes. You are all lucky to have your worthless hides saved from the other end 
of the firing squad, but if you fail to comply with my standards, I swear, if you 
reach home alive, I will see to it, that it's my personal job to kill you! Is that 
clear?" Sorkan finishes by throwing his coffee down his throat like a shot of whiskey 
and crushing the Styrofoam cup between his massive fingers. "YES SIR!!" everyone 
shouts. "You are all about to take on a dangerous mission. You are all aware of the 
risk, feel free to back out if you don’t think you can handle it, I only want determined 
soldiers, you're gonna die one way or the other." Ryder confidently steps up. "Sir, 
I do not wish to be a part of this pointless conquest. I have much higher qualifications 
then these low lifes. I wish to be relieved of my duty SIR. I don't care if I die, 
but not on some crap ass mission like this one, SIR!!" "As you wish soldier," Sorkan 
said more hushed than ever before, He raises his pistol and pops a shot into Ryder’s 
head. "Is there anyone else?" asks Sorkan glowering at the remaining RT squad, but 
there is no response. "Good, follow me please."
	The squad followed Sorkan. They received their equipment from the munitions hangar 
and loaded them or set them up. They put on their uniform, board a jet shortly after, 
and by then it was nearing night time. The Jet was flown to Komsomolsk, eastern Russia. 
The squad depart the plane and board Black hawk helicopters. On the hawks, the squad 
gear up in to thier uniforms. It's a black shirt with a tight gray coat, still allowing 
maximum flexibility. They wear either gray pants or green camouflage pants. The plan 
is once again revised; Ceiko, Jatom and Yasma will do a rope slide on to the roof 
and secure the helipads so Yuri or no one else could escape. Zygot and Lax would 
do a Halo jump from the helicopters and parachute at about 40 meters down, dangerous 
but effective. The final moves would be fighting their way to the top and flush out 
Yuri where he would be fragged. It was fool proof!!
	Zygot and Lax strapped on their parachutes, goggles then jumped simultaniously aligning 
themselves into head first position. They felt the rush of wind against their goggles 
and face. It was so fast, they had already fallen half of the way. Lax and Zygot 
both pulled their rip cords making their bodies swing upwards. Then they both saw 
it: about eight flashes of light! That meant one thing in war: DUCK!! The bullets 
skimmed past their ever so fast reflexes. Then more lights appeared, this time they 
weren't so fast. One of the bullets struck Zygot's parachute, it deflated and fell. 
With total luck, Zygot took off his parachute and grabbed onto Lax's leg. A few more 
bullets skimmed past Lax's body, "ARGHH!!!!" he screams in pain as the burning sensation 
eats into his skin.
	They both detatch their parachutes, jump onto the cool snow and begin to run west, 
toward the skyscraper. Zygot and Lax both load their weapons and watch in the near 
distance, the Black hawks drop their team. The birds begin to fly away but an artillery 
cannon implanted on the mountains finds it first... "RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT...
	BAOOMM!!!", it explodes with a large flash of light and smoke. "Good, they are safe. 
Zygot, you're going to get up to the top and give sniper cover with the delta team" 
says Lax, "I'm gonna help you man! I'm not staying out here!" replies Zygot with 
a worried look on his face,"You're going to be more help out here! Snipe any men 
who attempt to use the artillery cannons, copy?" "Copy Sir!" replies Zygot with a 
determined expression. Lax hails the other Hawk and gives the thumbs to Lax as he 
holds out his M9 in front of him looking in the front door.
