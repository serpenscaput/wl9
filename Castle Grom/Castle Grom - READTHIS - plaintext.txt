[STORY]

This story starts out long before we come to meet B.J. But you already know how that 
chapter ended. We meet B.J. in a taxi just outside the Russian border. There are 
reports that the Nazis have captured several old and very horribly defended Russian 
army bases. B.J. has been given a false passport under the name Bill Hammond. "Sir 
what is the nature of your stay in Russia. Are you here on business or is it for 
pleasure." asked the Russian in a thick accent. B.J. has been told that he's supposed 
to say that he's going on vacation and that he will stay just a week. His passport 
was cleared and the taxi pressed on to New Moscow. It was about 40 miles northwest 
of Stalingrad and was not going to be attacked by the Nazis. Hitler deemed it to 
be of no danger. With Hitler dead nobody knows who is leading the Nazis now as they 
are still fighting. They arrived some hours later in New Moscow at the U.S. Embassy. 
It was the middle of the night and there was a hotel that with a room that was paid 
for just down the street. B.J. gave the $1,200 in American money to the driver and 
said that should cover his return trip home. The taxi driver thanked B.J. for the 
huge tip and drove off. The next day there was a meeting and as B.J. would say blah, 
blah, blah, lets skip this meeting. So as B.J. would do if he were telling the story 
there's a meeting and he got his mission briefing. Here's the quick rundown of the 
mission. There are several old Russian bases were captured by the nazis just hours 
before Hitler was killed by B.J. The bases are codenamed House of Hay, House of Wood 
and House of Bricks. B.J. was sent to an army airfield about 10 miles outside of 
New Moscow to load the plane that he would drop out of. When he got there though 
he had to use the restroom, and he took a... "Hey, what the hell is going on here?! 
I don't need people knowing what I did in the bathroom before leaving for a mission. 
Get back to the story and don't tell them what I did in the bathroom." said B.J. 
Well B.J. was dropped about 3 miles outside of the House of Hay and entered through 
a back door. After he entered the base he pulled out his combat knife and saw a guard... 
"You idiot! This isn't a book!!! They have to play the mod to find out what happens 
to me. Donâ€™t say anymore. I'm hiring a new storyteller for the next mod!" shouted 
B.J. Now go play Castle Grom!
