==========================================================================


  Thanks for downloading Desperate Measures, a new Wolfenstein adventure
  in episodic format, from the creator of Conflict in the Fatherland and
  Project Totengraeber.  With a "back to basics" style that concentrates
  on delivering a solid level design experience without all the eye candy,
  Desperate Measures marks my return to classic Wolfenstein as it was
  meant to be.
  
  I hope you enjoy these new episodes.  Creating them has been a blast
  from the past.

  THE STORY
---------------/

/ EPISODE ONE: THE STRONGHOLD                               AVAILABLE NOW!

  While the commanders of the Schutzstaffel gather for strategic
  briefings at the SS-Hauptamt, B.J. Blazkowicz is sent to infiltrate
  a key Nazi stronghold on Allied suspicion of biological weapons being
  stored there.  With much of the stronghold's SS presence diverted,
  a small window of opportunity exists for Blazkowicz to penetrate an
  otherwise impenetrable fortress.

  If the Nazis have indeed developed the kind of bio-weapons the Allies
  have heard rumors about, it could spell disaster for the war effort.
  Blazkowicz's mission is to confirm or deny the presence of these
  weapons, and if they exist, destroy them.

  New Allied intelligence suggests that Obersturmbannführer Hans Grosse,
  normally in command of nearby Castle Wolfenstein, has been reassigned.
  It is possible that he now oversees the stronghold that is Blazkowicz's
  next target.  Utmost caution should be exercised, as Hans' monstrous
  history of war crimes speaks for itself.


/ EPISODE TWO: GIFTKRIEG
  
  Hans Grosse is dead, but the deadly biological agent the Allies sought
  has already been taken elsewhere.  According to manifests, they are now
  in the heavily-guarded fortress at Erlangen, where mass-scale
  production of deadly toxic weapons is imminent.  Even worse, Captain
  Blazkowicz has discovered evidence of an imminent biowar attack against
  the West.
  
  Blazkowicz must now journey to Erlangen, find the weapons, and destroy
  them before the attack can be launched.
  
  Allied intelligence indicates that General Otto Giftmacher is in
  command of this operation, and it is likely that Blazkowicz will have
  to confront him there.  Erlangen is normally under the command of
  giantess guard Gretel Grosse - sister of the late Hans Grosse - so
  the threat may be that much more grave.
  

/ EPISODE THREE: EIN GROSSES PROBLEM

  The Nazis' biowar plans have been permanently shelved, thanks to the
  heroic actions of Captain Blazkowicz, who single-handedly destroyed
  their toxin stockpiles and assassinated General Otto Giftmacher.
  Unfortunately, all contact with Blazkowicz was lost shortly after his
  final mission report.  We have reason to believe that he may have been
  taken prisoner at Erlangen by Gretel Grosse.  A rescue operation has
  been deemed unfeasible.
  
  As a prisoner in the darkest dungeons below the fortress, alone and
  forgotten, you await at the hands of Gretel herself a vengeful death
  that will surely be as torturous as any she can provide.  However, the
  careless inattentions of your prison guard have provided you with an
  opportunity - an opportunity that you have not failed to sieze.

  Tackling the guard from behind and choking him to death, you grab his
  sidearm and make a run for it.  There are untold levels of heavily-
  guarded fortress above you, but at ground level lies freedom, and it
  is freedom that you seek.  There's just one very big problem: You'll
  have to deal with Gretel Grosse before you reach it.


/ EPISODE FOUR: FIRST, DO NO HARM

  After spending three weeks of inaction recuperating from his ordeal at
  Erlangen, B.J. Blazkowicz is sent back behind enemy lines to investigate
  reports of strange activity at Castle Hollenhammer, deep in the German
  mountains.  This wintery retreat, once considered abandoned by Allied
  intelligence, shows new signs of life - life of a dangerous sort.

  There have been rumblings about crazed, gray-skinned soldiers running
  amok near the castle, and even civilian casualties at their hands.
  The Nazis' most preeminant mad scientist, Doctor Schabbs, has also been
  seen in the area.  Something sinister is going on at Hollenhammer, and
  if the wild speculation about "undead soldiers" and "reanimated
  corpses" is true, it could present a signifiant threat to Allied Forces.
  
  Blazkowicz's mission is to infiltrate Castle Hollenhammer and put a stop
  to whatever mad experimentation is being done.  If Doctor Schabbs is
  behind these experiments, he is to be terminated with extreme prejudice.


/ EPISODE FIVE: MUTANT MASTERMIND

  Schabbs is dead, but his mad, mutated experiments are already on the
  march.  An platoon of undead soldiers is being readied at Offenbach,
  commanded by the renowned Nazi General Fettgesicht.  With these
  ruthless killing machines poised to attack, Allied Command has sent
  Captain Blazkowicz to Offenbach to destroy the regiment - and General
  Fettgesicht - using any means possible.

  Because of the covert nature of Blazkowicz's air drop behind enemy
  lines, he will only be armed with a pistol and a single magazine of
  ammunition.  While this is hardly sufficient armament against
  Fettgesicht's entire platoon of undead, it is our hope that Blazkowicz
  will be able to secure enough enemy weaponry to carry out his mission.
  A full frontal assault on Offenbach is out of the question, as it is 
  too heavily guarded.  Blazkowicz is the West's only chance.  Complete
  and total destruction of Fettgesicht and his army is imperative!


/ EPISODE SIX: THE FÜHRERBUNKER

  The mutant army has been laid waste, and the chambers of Hell now echo
  with the screams of their leader, Fettgesicht.  But the threat is not
  yet contained.  Captain Blazkowicz has discovered that, unbeknownst to
  us, a second platoon of mutant soldiers was created and dispatched to
  the Reichstag.  There, the Führer himself, driven mad by the foiling of
  his Giftkrieg offense, is using them as his own personal guard!
  
  With Blazkowicz still in the field, we've diverted him from Offenbach to
  the Reichstag itself.  His orders are to terminate the last vestiges of
  Schabbs' monstrous and inhuman soldiers, and in doing so, to eliminate
  the Führer himself.  Adolf Hitler has been the target of many Allied
  assassination attempts in recent months, none successful.  It is
  believed that this is our best chance at removing Hitler from power and
  bringing an end to the Second World War.  But the margin for error is
  nonexistent.
  
  The fate of millions depend on your actions, Captain Blazkowicz.
  Good luck, and godspeed.
