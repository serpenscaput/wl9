Description             : I had made 2 maps for Spear of Destiny and I never
                          finished them. So I took the time and I finished
                          them. I choosed to start the first map at FLOOR04
                          becuase there's where you get acces to the secret
                          level, which is level 19. FLOOR04 is my version of
                          the 1st map from the first episode of the original
                          wolfenstein. You can play first FLOOR19 or FLOOR04
                          or you can just play both.
                                                                        
Instalation		: Before unziping this file into you're Spear of
                          Destiny folder, make a copy of the original
                          gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.wl6.

How to Play             : Start the game like this: wolf3d.exe -debugmode
                          Then, when you get done choosing the skill and
                          appear on level one, press ALT + SHITF +
                          BACLSPACE at the same time. Now, press TAB + and
                          select map 4. That's all.

Special Thanks to	: Id for Wolf & Spear.
