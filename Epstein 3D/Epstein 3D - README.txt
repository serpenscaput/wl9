On August 10, 2019, disgraced billionaire and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his cell within the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but others have held suspicions that there was foul play involved. His guards were asleep, the cameras were broken, and the footage of his last moments somehow vanished. A coincidence, or was it?

These suspicions materialized when members of the notorious hacking collective "Children of the Hole" hacked their way into the Central Intelligence Agency archives and found a particularly incriminating piece of evidence: a game known as "Epstein 3D" which was based on the engine of critically-acclaimed first-person shooter known as Wolfenstein 3D.

The truth is out now, and for the first time, witness Epstein's final moments from the eyes of a shadowy figure. With intense toilet paper-based combat, ultra-realistic stealth, and an emotional story, Epstein 3D will blow your mind and your soul.

WARNING: PLAYING THIS GAME MIGHT ATTRACT UNWANTED ATTENTION FROM THE CIA. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
