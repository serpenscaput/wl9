SPDemAC.doc

This set SPDemAC.ZIP is a 4 level add-on to be used with Wolfenstein 3-D.  It contains 
4 levels, the 2 Spear of Destiny demo levels, a secret and a Boss level.

Although it can be played on the PC (with the 1.4 shareware version), its main purpose 
is to 
give Acorn and Archimedes users the option of playing the Spear  demo.
