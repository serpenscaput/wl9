Introduction

Unsung, is World War I adventure in Wolfenstein 3D,
it lets you slog through the trenches in true pixelated
FPS fashion. Along the way as you fight through the
German trenches as an Allied trench raider in an attempt
to disable a crucial German artillery bunker, you had
better watch out for machine gun nests, flamethrowers,
poison gas, and an army of soldiers out to kill you.

Based off Wolf4SDL code, Unsung is a stand alone
mod which does not require dosbox to run on Vista or
Windows 7. With new graphics, sounds, levels, and
weapons, prepare for a whole new Wolfenstein 3D
experience. 

====================================================
Running/Installation

Unzip the files to whatever file location you like,
and run the file unsung.exe. So long as all the files
are in the same directory everything should be fine.

If you would like to run the game in windowed mode
instead of full screen, create a shortcut and add the
following to the target window in the shortcuts
properties.

--windowed

For example so that it would look something like this.

C:\Unsung\unsung.exe --windowed

====================================================

Controls

Due to being based of an old game, Wolfenstein 3d, 
Unusng does not have the same type of controls as many
modern FPS games. Since some players may not like the
older style controls, two sets of controls are set up.

The Arrow keys are the traditional old style controls.
Where the right and left arrows turn the player instead
of strafing to the sides.

The W, A, S, and D keys have been set up like many more
modern FPS games. W and A move the player forward and
back and S and D strafe the player side to side.

In addition there are a few other keys controls.

H = use health kit
R = reload weapon
1-4 = select weapon
Ctrl = fire weapon
Space = Open\Close door
Shift = Run


For further information select the manual option on the
main menu in the game.
