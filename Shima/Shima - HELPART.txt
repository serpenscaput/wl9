You frantically search the guard's body, prying the type 14 pistol from his fingers. The other guards almost
certainly heard him cry out as you drove his head into the door frame.
Taking possession of the gun and his bayonet, you steel yourself against the back wall of the holding cell.

You are Sun Anying. Six weeks ago you were selling oranges on the streets of Peking when the generalissimos 
men approached you, speaking of the honor of serving in the national revolutionary army, that you would soon
drive the Japanese imperialists from Chinese soil.

Two weeks later, you and four hundred others were encircled by the imperial Japanese army outside Tianjin.
With no other option besides total destruction, you and the others were taken as prisoners and transported
to Water Purification facility 17, a prisoner of war camp located inside an old Portuguese fortress,
under the authority of the ruthless Major Testuo.

In the intervening weeks, your comrades were taken away one by one until only you remained. Their screams leaving no 
secret as to their fate. Determined to avoid the same for yourself, you spent the last two weeks of your captivity 
mentally preparing yourself to be killed rather than taken alive. 

Conscript Sun Anying, you've got a gun and six floors of hell to get through. Good luck!

^c7ePOWER PLAYER TIPS AND TRICKS
^c00
-The IJA prefers Belt-fed machine guns over the Chainguns favoured by the Germans. Despite a slower rate
of fire, these boast greater power and accuracy with a much lower chance of jamming. However, ammo can
be frustratingly hard to come by.... 
-Despite its low power and questionable reliability, the Nambu is surprisingly accurate at long ranges. 
-Japanese commissioned officers are well-trained swordsmen as a rule. Avoid getting too close!
