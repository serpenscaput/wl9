June 2008: Hellion\p 

Description: "From an unknown land and through distant skies came a winged warrior. Nothing remained sacred, no one was safe from the Hellion as it uttered its battle cry...Screaming for Vengeance." This is one of the best if not the best map I've done so far. Hope you have fun playing this!\p
