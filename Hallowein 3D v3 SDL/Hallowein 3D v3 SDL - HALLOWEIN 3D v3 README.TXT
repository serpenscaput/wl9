Hallowein 3D version 3 (Wolf4SDL version)
-------------------------------------------

1st version: October 1997 (Used Mapedit, Wolfedit, HEX editing WOLF3D.EXE)
2nd version: October 2003 (Some extra modification using Flo's Floedit program)
3rd version: October 2019 (WDC, source code mods, etc..)

-------------------------------------------

Well, here it is - 22 years since I released Hallowein 3D v1. I figured that I would 
spruce it up one more time.
Thanks for playing! I hope it's not too bad!

-------------------------------------------

Changes from version 2 to version 3:

-------------------------------------------

1st off, the HEX editing and or Floedit really messed with things. I had to export 
all of the sounds, graphics,
and maps, and re-import into a fresh copy of of Wolfenstein 3D (shareware version).


Some of the graphics were just not right. I must have been in a hurry at the time, 
plus my old VGA
monitor was too dim to see the darker colors. So anyway, I touched up some of the 
graphics and sounds.

Original maps were touched up and modified a bit.

Added ceiling and floor textures. Gun bobbing, etc.

Added three new maps (Levels 9, 10, 11). That's a total of 13.

Made a Skeleton guy to take the place of the Officer actor

Modified the Bat from SOD 2,3 that takes the place of the Mutant actor.

Two new bosses on levels 10 and 11. Big Pumpkin Boss and the Witch Bitch.

Made some new walls, sprites, sounds.

The "Spookfest" name for level 1 was coined by Chris Chokan (I remember).

Objects:
Some will disappear if you walk through them. It will give you 13 points but they 
are not counted as "treasure".
Relieve yourself at some toilets (100% health). Not counted as treasure.
Treasure objects added: Magic Mushrooms (100 points). Oktoberfest beer (666 points, 
100% health).
And a few more power ups added for fun.

Modified Wolfenstein 3D source code is included in this archive.

Finally, the Dog actor. It always bothered me that I used it. It just didn't feel 
right.
I wanted to draw a new one, but I ran out of time (I'm not a great artist too).
It wasn't an easy decision. Either remove the dog or replace it.
I decided to use the Dog sprites from the Alien Wolfenstein patch. The art was made 
by Mark Fleig.
I corresponded with him in the late 1990's and he was happy that I made maps and 
added sound to his patch.
I hope he doesn't mind. He's a really good artist and his dog actor works and looks 
great in Hallowein.

Trivia

The 2nd floor (Sidereal Screams) was patterned after the building of an electronics 
manufacturer I worked for
in the 1980's. The main building consisted of two large WW II Quonset huts with a 
shell built around them.
The weird space between the two huts is where the gold key is located. The exit elevator 
is located where I worked.
The company (Sidereal Corp.) is no more and the building was torn down a long time 
ago.
