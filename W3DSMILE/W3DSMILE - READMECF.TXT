This zip contains the following:

        smileswp.wl1    : Takes the place of VSWAP.WL1
        2smile.bat      : Swaps smileswp.wl1 and VSWAP.WL1
        2wolf.bat       : Restores the original game
        Readmecf.txt    : This file you're reading right now

Smileswp.wl1 is a replacement for the VSWAP.WL1 file in the original 
shareware Wolfenstein 3D game.  I replaced some of the graphics with 
my own and added some more blood. It's...different. This is a kindler,
gentler holocaust, you might even say it was a Happy Holocaust!

TO USE: copy these files to your wolf3d directory, then use the batch files
to swap the VSWAP files (ie. switch my graphics for yours). 
If you want to use the smiley face graphics, use 2smile.bat. The original
graphics are saved in a file called WSWAP.WL1 and can be restored with
the batch file 2WOLF.WL1. I hope you like it and thank you to the 
people responsible for Wolfednstein and the various editors.
ENJOY!
