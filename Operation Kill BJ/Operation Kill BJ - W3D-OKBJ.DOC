              "Operation: Kill BJ!" - the new Wolfenstein levels

                                  Version 1.3

                               By Richard Kelly

NOTE: These levels have NOT been tested with the Acorn version of Wolfenstein
3-D or under the Lunix operating system.

                                Quick Reference

     Unzip the files into your Wolfenstein directory (no files are
overwritten).  Enter VSWAP to alternate between the new graphics and the old.
Enter MAPS to alternate the new maps with the old ones.  Enter IDENTIFY to
find out what maps and graphics the game's set up to play.  These files are
for the 60-level version of Wolfenstein ONLY.

                                 Installation

     Thank you for downloading my files!  The archive should contain the
following files:

W3D-OKBJ.DOC - This documentation.  Duh!
VSWAP.NEW    - The new graphics.
MAPHEAD.NEW  - The first part of the new levels.
GAMEMAPS.NEW - The second part of the new levels.
IDENTIFY.COM - An executable file
MAPS.COM     - Another executable file.
VSWAP.COM    - Yet another executable file.
SAVEGAM0.NEW - The first pre-saved game.
SAVEGAM1.NEW - The second pre-saved game.
SAVEGAM2.NEW - The third pre-saved game.
SAVEGAM3.NEW - The fourth one.
SAVEGAM4.NEW - The fifth one.
SAVEGAM5.NEW - The SIXTH one.
SAVEGAM6.NEW - Well ...
SAVEGAM7.NEW - You get
SAVEGAM8.NEW - the idea.

These files should be extracted into the same directory the 60-level
commercial version of Wolfenstein 3-D is located.  NO FILES WILL BE
OVERWRITTEN, NOT EVEN WHEN THE GAME'S GRAPHICS OR LEVELS ARE ALTERNATED.
Instead, the setup simply changes the names of the files ... nothing more.

     You can alternate the new levels with the original levels by entering
MAPS at the DOS prompt.  You have sixty new levels to enjoy.
     You can alternate the new graphics with the old by entering VSWAP.  The
new graphics have no new objects, but have several walls replaced:  Grey stone
walls are replaced with silver stone walls.  Blue dungeon walls are replaced
with semi-transparent blue stone walls.  The red bricks have a more
interesting texture, they're a little bit bigger, they have a couple more
"pictures" of mine, and have signs instead of Eagle Stickers;  I could put a
new german phrase in now, since I could use a German/English dictionary and
look up the German translation for "Stop!" (I ended up using a word that was
more like "Halt!", since "Halten!" looked better than "Stoppen!").  Steel
plated walls are replaced with green triangular walls.  I learned about
shading in Art Class and graphical textures by examining the original graphics
of Wolfenstein very closely.

     NOTE: To those who might ask me where I ray-traced the picture of the
potted flower (replacing the Eagle Statue wall image), no ray-tracing was used
in any of my new graphics!  I did all the graphics MYSELF.  Though I don't
mean to be vain, I just happen to be good at drawing plants.  I've only made
this note so I won't be hounded with this same question by endless amounts of
people, thank you very much.

     You can run the old maps with the new graphics and the old graphics with
the new maps.  Can't remember what levels and graphics that you have the game
set up to run?  Enter IDENTIFY.  It will tell you itself.

     You'll find a different set of saved games when you run my new levels.
The saved game titles you weren't responsible for I did myself.  I put them
there solely as a way for you to preview some of my favorite new levels, aside
from Level 1 of Episodes One, Five, and Six (my favorite new episode as a
whole is Two).  You needn't keep my saved games, so save over them as you
wish.  When you re-enable the original levels, you'll find your saved games
for the original levels are again available.

     Some of the original boards have pushwalls that can be pushed the wrong
way and cause you the loss of bonus items (or, in level 7 of Episode 4, the
loss of your key).  I avoid this approach entirely because I feel it just
simply isn't fun and is unfair to the player.

     And the par times, you ask?  Well, I'll be perfectly honest with you.  I
just simply haven't got around to figuring those out yet (I can only figure
out par times the hard way, since the boards are my creation;  the "hard way"
means playing a board from start to finish through only the rooms and halls
you need to, pushing only the walls you need to, and starting the board out
with a pistol, 100% health, and 8 ammo on the "I am death incarnate!"
difficulty).  But here's the par times for the first episode.

     I hate to be telling you what you should and shouldn't do, but the latest
distribution policy requires me to ask this of you:  Please DON'T call Apogee
for any reason concerning these new boards.  Id isn't responsible for the new
boards' creation and doesn't support the levels in any way.  The batch files
will remind you of this.

The pre-saved games will send you to these areas:

"E2/L2": Episode 2, Level 2.  Starts off with a unusual pushwall trick and
then gets better.  Fun, fun, fun.  Hard, too!
"E2/L7": Episode 2, Level 7.  Like the original, you have the option of
finishing the level quickly or going through some hidden rooms for extra
points and extra challenge.  Unlike the original, though, I actually LIKE this
level.
"E2/L0": Episode 2, Level 10.  There's a booby-trap somewhere around in this
level.  Here's a hint to find the trap: "Fool's Gold".  There's a hidden
locked door and a hidden world as well.  Good hunting.
"E3/L0": Episode 3, Level 10.  Don't try to shoot these ghosts down;  they're
invincible!  Professionals may try getting all the points they can before
going to the elevator, but if you're anything less, it'll be all you can do
simply to get to the elevator in one piece!
"E3/L9": Episode 3, Level 9.  The Hitler board was never like this.
Threatening officers are placed in new scenarios and professional level
layout.  In the area with Hitler himself, most of the ammo is in a place where
you're exposed to the enemy in four different directions.  That secret with
the extra ammo is still around, accessed by pushing one of the walls with the
Hitler picture.  I ain't tellin' ya whar.
"E4/L3": Episode 4, Level 3.  Screw the original level (excuse my language) -
any one room from this level tops it all hands down!  But don't take my word
for it;  try the level out yourself.  Getting past this one is strictly trial
and error - it'll be easier for you when you know where you're going (though
it's still very challenging).  The largest hallway has several objects placed
near doors - use the objects to determine what room to go to when.  This board
challenges the player both physically and mentally.
"E5/L3": Episode 5, Level 3.  Big, big level is nothing like the original, but
you'll hardly mind.  The largest hallway has every turn marked in a specific
way - learning how to use the marks will make the journey much easier.
"E5/L0": Episode 5, Level 10.  There are two trails of treasure;  both lead to
an elevator, but each one leads to different scenarios.  This idea was
inspired by Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold.
"E6/L6": Episode 6, Level 6.  There are two pushwalls;  pushing either will
block your way to the other, but will allow you to proceed to the elevator.
Each pushwall takes you to different scenarios, but no matter which way you
go, the other side will eventually come back to haunt you!  There's a way to
get to the other side, but I'm not going to tell you how or where.
"E6/L8": Episode 6, Level 8.  This level has it all: a bit of treasure hidden
behind an object, visual spectacles, a pushwall shortcut, and movie-style
sequences.  There's also a pushwall you can push from one side to get more
ammo or from another side to get more health;  you get three chests of jewels
regardless of the direction you push.

                                   Revisions

The following modifications have been made:

Version 1.3:
Levels: I've redone Level 1 of Episode Five and Level 8 of Episode Six.  A
*very* minor bug with pre-saved game #8 is fixed.
Miscellaneous: Compiled .BAT files into .COM files with a utility called
BAT2EXEC.EXE by Doug Boling.

Version 1.2:
Levels: One level of Episode Five had a bug.  This problem was located in a
secret area.  A door and an extra Floor Code were all that was needed to fix
the problem.  The only change the player will notice is an additional door.
Also note that Level Nine of Episode Six is partly redone.  The level's new
formula is to build up the suspense.
Graphics: I remade the graphics of the steel plating (again), the red bricks
(they're slightly bigger now, with a little more texture), the unlocked doors,
and the door sides.  I made minor changes to other graphics I made.
Miscellaneous: The wording of the documentation is somewhat more compact.
Flawed reference to Episode Four is now corrected to Episode Five (in the Bugs
section).  The game's new story has been altered slightly, though the plot is
exactly the same.  The Bugs section has more information on the author's
future plans.  The documentation has a quick-reference section added for those
who don't want to read the lengthy documentation.

Version 1.1:
Graphics: In this version, the texture of the Silver Stone Walls is improved.
I originally made a graphical mistake with one or more of these walls, but the
mistake was in one of the places I added texture, so the problem was fixed
automatically.  I made minor changes to a few other wall images.

    If I release future versions, I'll probably make more new graphics and
redo one or more levels.  I plan to replace the grey brick walls, the red
bricks, the brown canyon walls, and the blue panelling.  Expect things like
Brown Bricks, Diamond tiles, and so on.

                                     Bugs

     I have thoroughly beta-tested each and every one of these new levels on
the highest difficulty.  None of them have given me any bugs - not even "Out
of memory!" errors.
     The only problems occur in the original levels as well.  They are
problems in the game itself - the EXE files.  Some of these bugs are:  Dogs
sometimes disappearing when stopping in a doorway to bite you, two sides of a
particular block sometimes changing into a darkened Gray Stone wall (after
loading a saved game before starting a new game), Flashing Screen Borders
(elaborated in MapEdit's documentation), and a technical Moving Actors problem
(the last bug also exists with the Pac-man ghosts and the sprite of B.J.
running at the end of Episodes One and Five).
     When I learn the language "C" better, I plan to dig into the source code
and fix these bugs myself.  The "Out of Memory!" errors and flashing screen
borders will be very easy to fix;  the problem can be fixed manually by the
player without modification to the program, but I'd rather have the game fix
the problem automatically - don't you?
     The new EXE file MIGHT have the menus use two digitized sounds -
including a new sound I'd record myself.  I also plan to have the game support
more IRQ settings.  I would also like to add six extra door images;  the doors
would change to an unlatched image when they are moving and "latch back" to
their original image when they've completely closed.  I think that would be a
nice effect.

                                     Story

     You come home from what you thought was a successful mission and plan
many days with your movie-star wife.  However, the General calls you a day
later with bad news: Neither Schabbs nor Hitler were killed - you annihilated
simple clones.  After hearing this news, you are NOT happy.
     Though your actions DID stop Operation Eisenfaust, an even more
horrendous plot is underway to release clones all across the world, starting
with the U.S..  The clones will cause such confusion that the world will
become too vulnerable to Germany, and Hitler will conquer.
     America's best spy learns that only Schabbs and Hitler know particular
Top Secret information involving these clones.  Without that information, the
plan can never be carried out.  You are ordered to go back and destroy Schabbs
and Hitler.
     You reach the entrance of Dr. Schabbs's castle and look all around you,
but not above you.  Seconds later, you're tackled, and you awaken in a
dungeon, miles away from where you want to be.
     You wittingly break the neck of a Nazi guard and snatch his gun, only
THIS TIME someone heard you.  You start to hear footsteps, and you're ready
for action (you hope).  Assuming you survive the dungeon threat, you
contemplate your duty ahead, and the odds against you.
     One man.  Thousands of enemies.  Halls ahead that are purposely built to
confuse the escapees.  Greater threats against you than ever before.  Fail,
and the U.S. goes to Hitler.  Win, and ... well ... the U.S. goes to Clinton
in 1992.
     Man, it just doesn't pay to get up in the morning.

                               Acknowledgments

     I'd like to thank Bill Kirby, Bryan Baker, David Huntoon, and Warren Buss
for MapEdit, the utility I used to make the new boards in this archive (Mr.
Kirby was the original author of version 4.1; the other gentlemen enhanced the
utility from there).  Without MapEdit, I never would have experienced the joy
of making my own boards for Spear of Destiny, nor would I have been able to
make and release these boards.  Thank you very much, gentlemen!
     Thanks also goes to Doug Boling, who did the BAT2EXEC utility.
