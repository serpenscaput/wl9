Description             : The Sequel to Wolfenstein: Shadows of Destiny.
                          This Total Conversion is a homage to my favorite
                          Wolfenstein 3d mods, specifically WSJ's Project:
                          Eisenritter, and all the WolfenDoom TC throughout 
                          the years.

                          I hope you enjoy playing this Wolfenstein
                          adventure.

                          Get Psyched!
