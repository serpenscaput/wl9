1.  Description

Beyond Wolfenstein is a one episode game based on Wolfenstein 3d.  Here is a short 
summary of its features:

        9 new levels
	some new sounds 
	some new graphics
	some new items	
	new executable
	other suprises 


2.  Enemies

1.  Dog  -  easy to take down

2.  Brown Guard  -  these guys are the most common enemies you'll come across.  One 
shot from the shotgun should bring them down.

3.  Officer  -  these guys are quick and smarter than the average guard, but one 
or two shells will take them out.

4.  Green Guard  -  these guys are lethal.  They shoot faster than you can say "achtung," 
 but  one shell will bring them down too.

5.  SS  -  alone, these machine-gun toting goons should be no problem.  But I wouldn't 
recommend using the shotgun against groups of 'em.

6.  Flame-thrower  -  these thugs are the toughest of the regular guards, launching 
volleys of deadly flames with their flame-throwers.  

7.  SS Commander  -  bigger, tougher, and heavier armed, SS commanders are a challenge.


8.  Otto Giftmacher  -  ??

9.  The General  -  ?? 


3.  Items

There are a couple new items in Beyond Wolfenstein.

1.  Health Bonus:  Syringe  -  These syringes are scattered throughout the castle. 
 They give 1% health.

2.  Shells  -  Four shotgun shells to kill four bad guys.  Not bad.

3.  Shotgun  -  Four more shells.
