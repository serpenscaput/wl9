S-Blaster 3D, Beta 2 (November '04)

(C) 2004 NME Software


Release date for the finished version : January '05


This version is about 75% finished. Still missing are :

- Maps for episode 5 and 6
- Walking frames for the clones
  (don't be surprised when they turn into brown nazi guards...)
- Boss for Episode 5 (the Juggernaut)
- A few wall and object graphics
- Correct endarts for all episodes
- Some small code changes
- Improvement of the old graphics?

Coding Issues (things I'd like to add to the game, but don't know how to) :

- A doom-like label in the play screen which tells you about things like
  "You picked up a schnitzel" or "You need a gold keycard for this door"
- Making the pacman ghosts not only stationary but also blocking
  (I gave them a "shootable" flag, but they only block until you shoot them
  for the first time)
- A superweapon that damages (=> kills) all enemies in the same room /
  on the same floor code. No animation, just one frame and a flashing screen
  when shooting

	Other ideas :

	- Using two pistols after picking up a second one
	  (Using the same frames, only mirrored)
	- Adding grenades which can be thrown on a extra key

	Problem : I have not enough sprites left...
