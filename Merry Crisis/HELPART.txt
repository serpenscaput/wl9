^c7e										Merry Crisis! - The Story
^c00
This particular mod covers the rather unusual tale of an imp, known as Sno. Their current occupation can only be summarized as one that involves surpressing paranoramal phenomena in the "living world", especially anything that can be linked back to Hell, their home. 
Luckily, this task hasn't been a difficult one...  Until now.

Possesed toy soldiers, snow monsters, tanks, aggressive biblical creatures that even existed before Christ himself, this was an invasion like no other. There was only known leader - RoboClaus. 
This was indeed, a clusterfuck of a case. It seems that the very spirt of Christmas has ironically embodied itself as some form of Hell on Earth! Luckily, Sno is no stranger to Hell and is more than obligated to stop this wave of Yultide Fear. 

Good luck, Sno. We're all counting on you!
