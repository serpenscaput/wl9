^C[Dark Green]CHRISTMAS IS SAVED! ^C00
The dreaded RoboClaus, enraged by his defeat, explodes from self-detonation. Talk about a sore loser, eh? 

No hurry to head back to the Underworld quite yet, though. With those pesky toy soldiers and creatures out of the way, a warm hot coco and a quiet, relaxing hotel room await your presence.

As you rest, you turn on the TV and of course, a tacky Christmas cartoon is on. But hey, still enjoyable nonetheless. 
Eventually you head back home the day after, now with an unusual Christmas story to tell that even makes yourself question your own sanity.

^C[DarkRed]CONGRATULATIONS! ^C00

Thank you for playing my mod! A huge thanks goes to all of my friends and the WolfSource Discord. Without them, I probably wouldn't have been able to make a mod in the first place. 

Happy holidays and have a great new year! Now go get some hot coco and take a break, you deserve it!
