The Story; 
You George Bush has won the election and John Kerry 
walks away never to be seen for a long time. Two years
later John Kerry invites you to his castle "Kerenenstein"
in germany for dinner. "What a lovely idea" you think.
You pack your bags and fly over. 

Later on you arrive at Kerentein. "That's one big ass castle you think. Your body 
guards knock on the door. The door is answered
by John dressed very smartly. Suddenly he pulls out a gun and guns down your guards. 
After that evrything went black.

You wake up in a blue-bricked room with a TV in front of you. For some strange reason 
the news channel was in english. You watch in horror as you see John Kerry giving 
a speach about how you were his best friend and how you just disapered. But something 
worse happened. John Kerry was now president!!! The door to your room opened and 
Bill Clinton appeared. "Hi George, how's it going"? he said as he wheeled the TV 
out of the room. A guard entered. Now was your chance....
