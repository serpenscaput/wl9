ORIGINAL README FOR LEVELS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Warnings:
- All levels have been tested and errors/mistakes corrected.
  However, the following bugs may be encountered:

1) On some places where the door should be, there is nothing, but
   you cannot pass through there. Simply, you see to the room
   to which you cannot go.
   You can even hear the door opening/closing, when a soldier is
   passing throgh there. If you kill him in the door, they will
   stay open and you will be able to pass through ;)
   Fortunately, this bug will not have influence to level solvability.
2) If the game suddendly crashes with the error "Bad sound number",
   just try it again, it should be working.
3) On large open places (ex. E2L10) some objects disappear.
   This is a bug of the game - it cannot display more than
   a particular number of sprites (64?)
4) If you go into a secret place, when the part of wall has not
   yet stopped, you will see it fron the side on its final position
   and it will be moving away from you (dunno where).
5) The side texture of the door may disappear when opening the door.
6) The ghosts inflict no damage (well, sometimes...)
7) Don't forget to quick-save your game (F8).
   Beware about a secret room in E6L2 (this one causes an interesting bug
   and is left there intentionally) :)
8) You can pass through some particular wall tiles.
9) There ARE secret levels in this game, but they are WELL hidden.
   They are even harder than regular levels.
10)There are many many secret passages, but they are hidden in places where
   you would never search for them :) With these secret rooms you can
   have a highscore of more than 2 millions...
11)There is only one difficulty setting... The hardest one.

I have been trying to fix many of these bugs (and even more bugs),
but have not succeeded.
You can spread this game version as much as you want, but please
give it away in a non-modified form (that means even with the readme files
left intact).
You can modify these levels, but you cannot spread them without my express permission.
