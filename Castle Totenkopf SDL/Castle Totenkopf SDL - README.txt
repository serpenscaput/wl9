Thank you for downloading Castle Totenkopf SDL Edition,
a fan-made, Wolf4SDL-based mod/TC of the game Wolfenstein 3D.

Since Castle Totenkopf SDL is a stand-alone mod, you do NOT
need the standard Wolfenstein 3D to play it. Just extract the
files from this zip to a folder somewhere on your hard drive,
then run Wolf4SDL.exe to play. You should be good to go!

For more information about Castle Totenkopf SDL Edition, you
can select the "Read This" option in the main menu.


Also included in this zip is the Castle Totenkopf SDL source
(TotenkopfSDLSourceCode.zip) but you don't need it to play the
mod. I included it because I "might" be required to do so by
the LGPL license which SDL 1.2 was released under (though I'm
not entirely sure, because I'm just a hobbyist, not a lawyer.
But I'm providing the source code anyway, just in case.)

PLEASE DON'T SEND ME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO USE THE SOURCE CODE.
Sorry, but I don't have the time to help with all the possible
issues which might arise from its use. I included the old
README-devcpp.txt and README-Wolf4SDL.txt files to help with
setting up the code, but I can't guarantee anything. So if you
decide to use this code in your own mod or whatever, then you
use it ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
