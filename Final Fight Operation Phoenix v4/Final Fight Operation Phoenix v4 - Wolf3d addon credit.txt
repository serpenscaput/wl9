Thanks to Eric Lin for hosting the Wolf3D Haven forum, which brought so many people 
together to work on this mod.

Thanks to id Software for making Wolfenstein 3D and for providing the source code. 
Without them and their game, we'd have no addons.

And for last, thanks to James Shain for creating The Final Fight, without it, this 
mission pack would never exist.
