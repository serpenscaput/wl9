Thank you very much for downloading my wolf 3d set.  
This has 32 new levels, and some new graphics and sounds. 
Some of the grapics are from Escape for SS Prison, sorry for using them.
They were just to cool for my new set!
This wolf3d set is pretty difficult and 1 level is from the Wolfenstein
on Super Nintendo. This set is not impossible to beat. 
There were a few buffers/screw ups, but i fixed, and it wasent easy, 
There are 4 new weapons,a SWORD,a Rifle,a Auto-Mangum a Machine Gun,
a Rocket Launcher,a Solar Cannon,a Plasma Rifle,a Railgun   . There are 20 new walls 
and objects, but about 5 
and I hope you will find the new sounds particularly effective. 
I would like to give a special thank you to Jason Scorpson and 
Peter Alexandris.
