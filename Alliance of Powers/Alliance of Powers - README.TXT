Greetings,

Thanks for downloading 'Alliance of Powers', our 21-level Spear of Destiny add-on. 
 The enclosed files replace the original gamemap/maphead files from SoD.

The 'Alliance of Powers' is just that - two guys with individual mapping styles, 
joining forces to put together a set of levels for SoD.  The original SoD feel remains 
while the game play is more aggressive.  We hope you like the set.

The maps should be free of bugs, but should you find one, please send a report to: 
HRandSB (at) hotmail.com

Special thanks to Brian Lowe for his 'yellow site' and to everyone at the Dome.

Go blast some Nazi's!!!
