Ipank7000's Mapset #2                             					 18 June 2015

Here's a new mapset and the sixth add-on by Ipank7000, 60 new levels. Feel free to 
use them as your own project but please give me credit if you use them (^_^) . This 
is the SDL version so dosbox or any dos emulator isn't neccessary to play this mapset. 


You need your own registered : 
	
* AUDIOHED.WL6
* AUDIOT.WL6 
* VSWAP.WL6

to play this mapset!

Note:
--------------
You can play it with ECWolf too, just put all *.WL6 files in this folder and remaing 
files as mentioned above same as Ecwolf executable directory.
You can get the ECWOLF in here: http://www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk/utilities.htm
