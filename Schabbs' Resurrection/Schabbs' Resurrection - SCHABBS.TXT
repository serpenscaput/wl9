1.  Story

Several months after the capture of the Spear of Destiny by B.J. Blazkowicz, Professor 
Quarkblitz decided to try to combine his cybernetics research with the late Dr. Schabbs' 
technique of raising the dead and turning them into mindless, deadly weapons of war. 
 First he experimented on Hans Grosse's body; he replaced all the injured body parts 
with robotics.  His cloned, half-human Hans's now guard the important parts of the 
Nazi base.  After the diabolical scientist finished with Hans, he turned to his ultimate 
goal:  the resurrection of Dr. Schabbs.  Schabbs' body was completely destroyed, 
however, and in the end only his brain was recoverable.  Quarkblitz created a half-robotic 
body for Schabbs' brain, and now the insane doctor threatens the world once again!

3.  Enemies

Schabbs' Resurrection has a whole new cast of actors.  I'd have put pictures, but 
this is a text file.

1.  Brown Guard  -  these guys are rookies, and need to get to point-blank range 
to shoot you.  One shot from anything'll take 'em out.

2.  Blue Guard  -  these guys are the most common enemies you'll come across.  One 
shot from the shotgun should bring them down.

3.  Officer  -  these guys are quick and smarter than the average guard, but one 
or two shells will take them out.

4.  Green Guard  -  these guys are lethal.  They shoot faster than you can say "achtung," 
 but  one or two shells will bring them down too.

5.  SS  -  alone, these machine-gun toting goons should be no problem.  But I wouldn't 
recommend using the shotgun against groups of 'em.

6.  Flame-thrower  -  these thugs are the toughest of the regular guards, launching 
volleys of deadly flames with their flame-throwers.  

7.  Hans Grosse Clone  -  although these guys are half-robotic clones of the original, 
and they've still got his personality and his double chainguns!

8.  Otto Giftmacher Clone  -  he's back, with a new blue uniform.  

9.  Otto Giftmacher Clone II  -  he's back again, with a vengeance, and a new chaingun!


10.  Adolf Hitler  -  what?!?  I though I already took care of this lunatic!

11.  Dr. Schabbs  -  the cybernetically enhanced menace is twice as tough as the 
original twisted man, and this time he's got missiles!

12.  the Dopefish  -  rumor has it that the dopefish secretly resides in a deeply 
hidden portion of the fourth section of Schabbs' bunker.


4.  Items

There are a couple new items in Schabbs' Resurrection.

1.  Health Bonus:  Syringe  -  These syringes are scattered throughout the base, 
but are found more often near Schabbs' lair.  They give 1% health.

2.  Dog Food  -  This nasty grub will and 1% to your health.

3.  Food  -  This less nasty-but-still-pretty-bad food will give you a 5% health 
bonus.

4.  Small First Aid Kit  -  Adds 10% to your health.

5.  Large First Aid Kit  -  Adds 25% to your health.

6.  Ammo Clip  -  These give you either 4 or 8 bullets, depending who drops them.


7.  Treasure  -  Picking up this Nazi gold adds to your score.

8.  One-up  -  Seems to be some sort of balloon with a picture of your head on it.
