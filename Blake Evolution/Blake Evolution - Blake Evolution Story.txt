  'BackGround Detail'


  It's the year 2050. The United States still exists. But now in a more Modern time, 
Communism has ended and a global treaty was signed to become one entire nation. The 
United States is now known as Global  Nations United.  The Government Has Grown to 
be very powerful, Many people Believe in the Existance of Aliens, But the Government 
Denies it. 


  'Your Character'

  Now a scientist Working in The Global Nations Top Secret Government labs was working 
on a project, it seemed to be something unexplainable. This Scientist's name was 
Thomas Drakes. He was working with his partner Leo Orliff,  As you continue your 
'research' you come to realize that this thing, it's not from any registered animal 
of any sort. You are Getting ready to leave work for the day, as you reach the door 
a group of security guards grab you and they arrest you,

  Thomas: What, WHAT!,  what are the charges

  Security: you have been working on a Project that is not your level and you did 
not tell any of the personnel of this, therefore you are being charged as a spy and 
will be sent to prison.



  'Level 1'


  Prison Center

  The Guards Escort you to the prison center and throw you into a cell. He says I 
will bring you your food in a few minutes. 

  You see a dead scientist in the cell. You begin to search his body and you find 
his journal. The Journal reads.  I have found the proof of aliens. I knew they were 
real, but why does the government hide them from us. The Government has some evil 
project planned. They're planning to steal some strange eggs from planet Zephros 
IX, one of the new planets that we have discovered. Unfortunately I'm stuck here 
in this cell after they caught me snooping in on their private meeting. If anyone 
is reading this, they're planning to turn the government into an empire with these 
so called aliens. A rebellion should be formed and they should be stopped. 

  You search the dead scientist again to find a pistol.  

  Thomas: hmm?  I'll wait for the guard to come then make my escape.
