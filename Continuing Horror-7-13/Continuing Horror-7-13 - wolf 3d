It conveys all the feelings itr is meant to, and everyone likes it. I am also sending the first 4 levels of the second part. I am stumped and don't know what to do for the last three. can you give me some original ideas? I appreciate your reading this, even if you don't download the levels.Nick MooreHACKER782
