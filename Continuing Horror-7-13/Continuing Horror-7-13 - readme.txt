And then we have two mapsets by HACKER782, going under the slightly convoluted names of 6 of 13-first blood(yours!) and Continuing Horror-7-13. These are again parts of a larger whole: the author only posted 6 out of 13 maps for the former, and 4 out of 13 for the latter. What we do receive is, well, consistent in mapping style. They are small to very small and action-packed, meaning some rooms are literally packed full of enemies and pickups. There's no way to get lost and not much to explore in these narrow passages and blocky rooms, it's just combat, combat, combat. Maybe you'll appreciate it.
