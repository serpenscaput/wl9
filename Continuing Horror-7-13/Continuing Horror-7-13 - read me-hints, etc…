You went looking for a challenge, and you got it. The next six levels will challenge your wits, your trigger, and your luck. These levels are very possible to complete, but they are not easy. If you complete these first six, E-mail me and I'll send you the other seven, making a 13 floor world of pain for you to enjoy. Here are hints and tips for the first six near-death experiences. If you need more help, E-mail me at HACKER782@aol.comWARNING!!! These will give you some secrets in the levels!  For a real challenge, don't read this! Once you have read it, you can't unread it! THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE!!!Level 1-Doors of DoomThere are nine doors here, and a block in the center. Beware of what's behind each door, and what's with the discolored blocks?Level 2-MassacrePretty simple. Open the door and hope to live.Level 3-Strafe or Die!This is a room and a long, twisty corridor. There are 25 men with dogs, but they don't shoot until they see you, so be careful of what's behind that next corner!Level 4-Another massacreGet the key, open the door. Sounds easy? Heh, heh, heh.Level 5-Patience, PatienceTons of guys, tons of powerups, tons of secret passages. Note the three sixes in the center, I thought it was appropriate.Level 6-Don't Get GreedyKind of like Doors of Doom revisited. Plenty of cool stuff, but watch that greed!
