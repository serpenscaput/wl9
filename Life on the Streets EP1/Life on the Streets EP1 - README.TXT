1.0) Getting Started

Unzip folder STREETS to your computer. To play Episode 1 run the program 'STREETS1'.

To play Episode 2 run 'STREETS2'. Life On The Streets won't work without an emulator 
on
newer versions of Windows. Having problems? See section 4.0.

Upon choosing a New Game you'll be prompted to choose a difficulty level. It's
recommended that you stick with the 'Normal' or 'Hard' settings as the difficulty 
level
of 'Impossible' is extreme and 'Easy' presents virtually no challenge whatsoever.


Any time during game play press F1 for the in-game instruction manual, and remember 
to
save frequently! (F2) 

NOTE: If the game screen appears windowed or is flickering press F6 to correct this 
issue.
This problem is a result of a very inefficient use of memory during the game's coding.

3.0) What's Next?

The third and final installment of Life On The Streets is currently in development.

I'm aiming to have 'Episode 3: The Demise Of Jay-Z'. finished by Summer 2015.


=========================================================================================



4.0) Troubleshooting

NOTE: If the game screen appears windowed or is flickering press F6 to correct this 
issue.
This problem is a result of a very inefficient use of memory during the game's coding.

This will also restart the music for the level in the event that it drops out. 

Life on the Streets is a 16 bit DOS application designed to run best on 386/486 computers.

This  software will run under different conditions with varying degrees of compatibility.

See the chart below to see how Life On The Streets will run on your system:

Operating System        Runs     Music     Sound

MS-DOS 3.00 - 7.00      Ok!      Ok!       Ok!
Windows 95/98/ME/NT4.0  OK!      OK!       OK! 
Windows XP/2000 32 bit  OK!      nope      somewhat
Windows XP/2000 64 bit  nope     
Windows Vista/7/8       nope
Any Other OS            nope


If your operating system isn't supported an emulator such as DOSBox is recommended 
(see
section 4.2). If your OS plays Life On The Streets fine but the Adlib music doesn't 
play
back you have the option of using an emulator such as DOSBox or running the program

natively along with the VDMSound application (see section 4.3). If you're using an 
older
machine running DOS and still having problems check section 4.1.


4.1) System requirements

Minimum System requirements: 
	- 386 Computer
	- 528 KB of conventional memory
	- 4 MB of free Hard Drive Space

Recommended System requirements:
	- 486 Computer
	- 2 MB total memory
	- 4 MB of free Hard Drive Space
	- Sound Blaster 16 or 100% compatible sound card 


4.2) Using DOSBox

DOSBox is an x86 emulator necessary to run some old DOS applications on newer computers.


DOSBox can be downloaded for free here:
http://www.dosbox.com/

Upon running DOSBox you'll need to mount your Life on the Streets folder using the 
MOUNT
command. example "MOUNT C C:\streets". In this example the folder c:\streets is mounted

as drive C. select the new drive C by typing "C:" and run Life on the Streets by 
typing
"streets1" for Episode 1 or "streets2" for Episode 2. 

If gameplay is slow or choppy try pressing Ctrl F11 or Ctrl F12 to adjust the emulated

CPU speed. It may take a very high cycle rate to begin running smoothly. You can 
also
set the amount of frames you want DOSBox to skip using Ctrl F7 and Ctrl F8. If you 
are
unable to improve performance using these settings try switching to dynamic core

emulation. Just enter "core=dynamic" at the DOSBox command line before starting Life 
On
The Streets. Setting the cycle rate to "cycles=max" on the command line may help 
too.
Check the documentation that comes with DOSbox for more detailed information. As 
a last
resort disabling floor and ceiling textures by pressing F9 increases the frame rate

considerably.


4.3) Using VDMSound

VDMSound is an application that can be used to playback Adlib music and sound effects

in DOS programs under Windows XP/2000.

VDMSound can be downloaded for free here:
http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=2071

Once installing VDMSound on your system, start Life on the Streets by right clicking 
on
the program and choosing "Run with VDMSound".

If you encounter noticeabe lag in the controls or the music is playing back poorly 
another
option is using an emulator such as DOSBox. See section 4.2 on DOSBox.

5.0) Contact Me

If you have any feedback at all e-mail me. Anyone making mods or whatever else, all 
the
art and sounds and everything in the game files are free to be used for other projects.

Also if anyone wants a copy of my source code let me know. I didn't put it up just

because didn't think there would be any interest.
