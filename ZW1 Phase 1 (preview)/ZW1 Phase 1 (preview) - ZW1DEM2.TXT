Frequently Asked Questions

Who are you?

I'm a Dutch male, 17 years old.

What is ZW1?

ZW1 is a project from me to create a 60 level pack
for the original Wolfenstein 3-D. No new graphics,
no funky source code changes, no new sounds, but
just levels.

What other episodes of ZW1 are avaiable at the time
of writing?

- A Preview of Episode 1, which is now obsolete and no longer supported.
- Episode 1 (ZW1PH1.ZIP)

Note: Episode 1 is still included, but this file will be replaced
      when the full Episode 2 is out.

What is the difference between ``Phase'' and ``Episode''?

Short, sweet, and simple: None.

How do i install these levels?

1. Install a clean copy of Wolfenstein 3-D Full Version
   in a new directory.
2. Extract _and_ overwrite the contents of the
   archive ``ZW1DEM2.ZIP'' into the new directory.
3. Run the normal EXE, and have fun!

How do i contact you about these levels?

Send an E-Mail to the above adress, and put
the text ``ZW1DEM2'' into the subject line. It
helps me sort mails.

What if i find a bug?

Follow the above instructions and explain
the bug to me, where it happened (episode and
level #), and what version of Wolfenstein 3-D
you're using.
