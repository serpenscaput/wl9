* Gameplay-information *

Forsaken is a simple, minimod 10-level reimagining of the "Lost Episodes" for Spear of Destiny, celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2024. What if the original creators of Return to Danger had gone the extra mile, transforming the EXE, palette, music, and sounds into a complete and immersive experience? You're about to find out! The Nazis have seized the Spear of Destiny and hidden it deep within a remote Moravian castle high in the mountains. Once again, the fearless B.J. Blazkowicz is called upon to infiltrate this heavily guarded fortress and reclaim the Spear. Are you ready for the mission of a lifetime?


* Storyline * 
You brace yourself against the unyielding wall, fingers gripping the chaingun with such intensity that your knuckles turn pale. Sweat pours down your body, the heat causing it to vaporize and form a mist that curls around the corner, hinting at your location. Despite your fatigue, you can't afford to pause – not now. Inch by inch, you edge closer to the corner, cautiously glancing around... A guard notices you! Both of you lift your weapons in unison! RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!!! … RING … RING … RING … The phone's ringing yanks you from sleep. It was just a dream... or perhaps a nightmare – another haunting memory of Castle Nuremburg. … RING … RING … RING … You groggily reach for the phone.

"Uh... yeah... who is this?"

"Hello, B.J. Blazkowicz?"

"Speaking."

"This is Admiral Powell of the United States Navy. We need your assistance."

"What’s the situation, Admiral?"

"Hitler has reclaimed the Spear! We've already lost three agents attempting to breach his stronghold. B.J., you’re our only hope now!"

A rush of thoughts overwhelms you. Over a year has passed since your return. You believed it was over. You risked everything, and now it seems for nothing. NO!!! Hitler’s minions have stolen the Spear from American soil – NOW IT'S PERSONAL!!! The Spear must be retrieved!

"I'll take the mission, Admiral."

At the conclusion of the SPEAR OF DESTINY Mission 1, B.J. recovered the Spear of Destiny and brought it back to the U.S., where it was secured. Desperate to regain it, Hitler dispatched Major Hans “The Axe” van Schlieffen and a squad of SS to America. In a fierce battle, Hans narrowly escaped with the Spear, returning to a secret Nazi fortress in West Prussia. This stronghold, constructed for atomic research, is carved from solid rock and reachable only through a sludge-covered wasteland near the castle. The U.S. Navy has arranged for B.J. to be transported there. Though several U.S. intelligence agents perished attempting to breach the fortress, the allied spy network has pinpointed the Spear of Destiny's location on the fortress’s uppermost floor, heavily guarded.
Good Luck, B.J. !
