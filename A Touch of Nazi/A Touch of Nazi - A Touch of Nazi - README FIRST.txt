                        A TOUCH OF NAZI
                         BY JOHN BUCKSNORT



     This set is a compilation of some of my favorite levels from Different games.

Included are a level from the registered version, a couple of reworked levels of 
mine,
a couple by SR, the creater of the SR series, (These were previously unreleased spear 
levels)
a pair of levels from one of my favorite sets, WOLF3d-60 is also included, as well 
as
a special secret level by Brian Lowe and a unique Boss level I created just for this 
set..
It has 3 different ending Possibilities...So sit back and shoot them Nazis dead.....

and if you survive the carnage of the first 9 levels, then you can tackle 
"The Gruesome Threesome on Level 9........Above all, HAVE FUN!! NO CHEATING!!  LOL
