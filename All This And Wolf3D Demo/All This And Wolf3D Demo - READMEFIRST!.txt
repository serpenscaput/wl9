The full level guide will be issued in the full version. Many of these levels is variable, but they are not in the full version. Levels 1-10 has only guards, dogs and SS, for example and such.

The level 1 here is only in the demo. This level won't be seen in the full version of ATAW3D.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHEN OPEN THE GAME!!!

When you enter the game, there's not the right ceiling colour or the right music playing. So here's what you need to do.

OPENING LEVEL 1.

Press TAB+Y, type 13. Press TAB+Z, type 254. Then you got the right stuff.

OPENING LEVEL 2.

Press TAB+Y, type 26. Press TAB+Z, type 78.

OPENING LEVEL 3.

Press TAB+Y, type 4. Press TAB+Z, type 126.

OPENING LEVEL 4.

Press TAB+Y, type 21. Press TAB+Z, type 46.

OPENING LEVEL 5.

Press TAB+Y, type 2. Press TAB+Z, type 156. And that's it.

There's a lot of cheating within too, so press TAB+something, and check it out!!! It's neat with that 4GW.

FOR NOW:

Thanks to Chris Chokan for starting up the EXE and guide me through 4GW.
