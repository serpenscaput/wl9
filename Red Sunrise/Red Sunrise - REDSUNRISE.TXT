The story:
In December 1944 military forces from the Soviet Union stopped their progress at 
the eastern frontier. All attempts to make contacts with Soviet generals failed. 

Allied forces at the western frontier were brought into serious problems because 
German soldiers from the eastern front were sent to the western front.
The allied forces are not strong enough to defeat improved German defence forces.

Six secret missions have to be accomplished in order to force the Soviet Union to 
fight again.
This addon contains 60 new levels with original graphics.
