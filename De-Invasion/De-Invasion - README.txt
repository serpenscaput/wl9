De-Invation
By Relic374

Info:

This is a 5 map long mod (including secret level, found on floor 1). I made the majority of this right after the release of Fuckerstein, which was a mod I made that was really bad. After getting it around... I'd say... 87% finished, I lost interest and left it as a WIP.

Since then, I've regained interest and finished it in about 4 days while on Easter break.

Throughtout the time I've started working on this again, it was really hard to keep myself from changing assets- I kinda caved though, as I did end up changing and switching around some sound effects

Story:

You're millionare Blow Job "BJ" Blaskowitz and you wake one morning to the realization that theres like... nazis in your mansion. You pick up your priceless winchester pistol (do they even make those?) and start reclaiming your mansion.
Don't ask my why you have prisons and cages with bodies in them, plus guns laying around-

What I Plan to Do:

This is only the start of my mapping journey. I think I've improved a lot since Fuckerstein... of course, fuckerstein sucked, but still.
I have another mappack in the works thats gonna change sound, graphics, and maps. It's gonna be super hard cuz I gotta do everything in DOSBox, but I'm gonna do it none-the-less. I dunno what I'm gonna call it yet.
I plan on releasing it sometime in summer, though rm I'm moving and school and stuff so no promises.

I do love to make Doom maps to, and I hope to get my first PWAD out soon.


Anyway, thanks for playing and reading this!
