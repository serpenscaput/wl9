Temporary Insanity includes a rather minimalist installation utility.
Copy the *.TI and *.BAT files into your Wolf3D directory.  Now just type
"install" to install Temporary Insanity, and "uninstal" to restore the
normal levels.  The other files are accessories of various sorts.
BLURB.TXT is a rather long plug for the levels, which you might have
seen before downloading them.  HINTS.TXT is the hint file for the
levels.  It also has a troubleshooting section and general information
at the beginning.  Be sure to read the beginning, but use the hints 
sparingly!  MAPDATA.DEF and OBJDATA.DEF are files for MapEdit which Nat
made to replace the woefully incomplete standard ones.  Use them if you
look at the levels with MapEdit.  README.TXT is a secret encoded message
from Saturn designed to hypnotize you into eating tofu.

These levels are freeware.  You may distribute them freely provided that
all of the files MAPHEAD.TI, GAMEMAPS.TI, INSTALL.BAT, UNINSTAL.BAT,
README.TXT, BLURB.TXT, HINTS.TXT, MAPDATA.DEF, and OBJDATA.DEF are kept
unmodified and together.

Like the blurb says, we'd love to hear your feedback.  Send comments,
suggestions, questions, and gripes to benrg (at) uclink.berkeley.edu.  Enjoy!
