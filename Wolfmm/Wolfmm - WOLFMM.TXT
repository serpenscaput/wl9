   
   Another old shareware set from the early years...
Although this set of levels has been preserved on CD-ROMs, the author's
notes are not included. I remember once downloading these same levels from
a (now defunct) ftp site (ftp.wustl.edu ?) with the documentation file...but 
I didn't keep the file. :-(
   What I do remember was that the author had an Asian name, and that he
expressed concern about the elevators working correctly, hoping to better
his design with a future update.
  Anyways, I fixed his elevator problems and corrected some start positions
(which he apparently changed to test his elevators, but forgot to move back).
And, of course, converted to version 1.4, keeping the false door images
intact.
  These levels require some thought, patience, and trial & error to get 
through them, since they are quite "puzzly". I'll leave you with a hint for
level one: be ready to RUN through the start and if you care to get the 100% 
bonus for kills, return MUCH later with a full chaingun. As usual, save your
game often!

			     Corrected secret elevator.
			     First 5 floors had misplaced start positions. 
			     This was evident after a careful inspection of 
			     things like elevator location, push wall 
			     destinations, key location, etc. Changed the 
			     start locations to more appropriate places.
