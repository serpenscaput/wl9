==================Rising Evil===================
       An evil scheme by a maniacal doctor

      -- A Schabbs Revolt by Ryan de Haast--
------------------------------------------------
== THE STORY ===================================
	It's 1942 and World War II is at full
force and the Germans are fighting a fierce 
battle against the Allies. There's a rumour going 
round that the Evil Dr Schabbs has found away to
create strong fighting machines to help Hitler
rule the world. This devastating experiment has
been given the name Rising Evil by the Allies.
Dr Schabbs deadly fighting machines have been
sent into battle to attack unyieldingly until
no other Allies are alive. Dr Schabbs has no
sympathy for his killing machines and if this
experiment was to succeed, it would spell
disaster to the rest of the world and humanity.

	These evil experiments have been rumoured
to be amoungst the mountains in Germany, in several
underground chambers and then leading to one of Dr
Schabbs secret labs, where the Evil doctor is
creating his evil killing machines.

	The Allies in desperate inspiration have
acquired maps from a few ally spies showing the 
locations of where these ingenious experiment are 
being held. There's reason to be held that these
chambers are to be heavily guarded, except for one
operating areas which is lighltly guarded 
and is considered to be the easiest way to infiltrate
the Nazi base and destroy Dr Schabbs and his evil
plans. The Allies have thought of the best person 
for the job, a man by the name of Captain William
J. Blazkowicz or known as B.J.

	You are B.J. Blazkowicz, and your commanding
officers are sending you to stop Rising Evil from
succeeding. Your target is to infultrate the Nazi 
Apartments, which lightly guarded and has been 
assigned as your entry point. You'll enter the
apartments through the sewers and work your way
through four underground chambers to a secret
lab, where the evil Dr Schabbs does all his evil 
experiments. It is believed to get to the lab
you'll have to travel through several chambers 
which you will eventually lead you to the lab, 
along the way you'll be caught up amoungst some
heavy fighting where the higher Nazi generals are
being trained. Your orders are to eliminate as 
much resistance as possible and kill the evil Dr
Schabbs and his deadly mean machines. This is one 
of your toughest missions yet and you'll be 
fighting against some of Hitler's toughest 
solgiers, so fight hard and remember to make 
use of the health and ammunition that has been 
left behind to help you through your mission.
The Allies and the rest of the world are counting
on you, so do your best and try and win for 
humanity.
