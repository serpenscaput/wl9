This zip file contains new levels for the full version of Wolfeinstein 3D. It replaces 
the levels for ep1 level 1 to 5, ep2 level 1 to 3 and ep3 level 1.

Before installing, first backup your copy of gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.wl6! Simply 
because you will have to overwrite your original levels with the new ones if you 
want to play with them, and vice versa.

Then, simply overwrite the gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.wl6 in your wolf3d directory 
with the files in this zip file.
