This is a stealth mod, as such the typical Wolf3d run-and-gun action can't be found 
here. You'll have to carefully plan your way and make sure 
you don't attract too many guards at a time.

Important note!!!

In level 2 you'll first encounter the officers. Take note that they can't be killed!!! 
You have to find some way to get past them without being
seen.

Features:

-Backstab kills instantly
-Starting weapon is always the knife
-No guards drop ammo
-Officers are invulnerable (you can still get 100% kills since they are not counted)

-Par times adjusted

To be able to play this, you need the following files from the original Wolf3D: AUDIOHED.WL6, 
AUDIOT.WL6, VGADICT.WL6, VGAHEAD.WL6, VGAGRAPH.WL6
and VSWAP.WL6.
