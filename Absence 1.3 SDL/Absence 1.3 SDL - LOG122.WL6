^C04 The Endoskeleton Class 1 has made good progress since the start of the project. 
We were finally able to fix the miscalculations in the walking cycle which caused 
them to fall over a lot. Now that this error is fixed, we can finally start mass 
production. A great day for everyone in this lab who has worked on this project!
