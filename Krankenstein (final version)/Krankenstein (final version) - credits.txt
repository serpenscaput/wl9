This mod was made with Floedit 2, Paint Shop Pro 7 and my own 'Seefiles' program.

 I did most of the graphics and a few sounds myself but included some,
for he most part modified, from DOOM and the Wolfenstein mods:
Hotel Romanstein,
Christmas Wolf,
Lost Episodes,
Schabbsdoom (for dr. Krankenstein).

The art is by Munck, Chagall and Rembrandt,
the photos are of Marilyn Monroe and queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
I was partly inspired by the thriller 'Coma' and the first danish private hospital,
'Mermaid Clinic'.

About the game...
Some levels are easy, some are difficult, floors 8 and 9 use some unusual secret doors.
No keys are behind secret doors, but the entire floor 8 is.
Some (but not all) locked doors are there for logical reasons and need not
(or can't) be opened.

The story...
You wake up at the morgue of a hospital led by dr. Krankenstein (a relative of Schabbs).
You must fight your way out, collecting evidence against the hospital,
and escape the doctor's clones on floor 8.

For more fun:
    make use of your dirty phantasy.
