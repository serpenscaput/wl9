^C[Olive]A SECRET PLACE
^c00The elevator shudders to a halt after a long, long descent. The air is thick and musty, and eerily silent.

You open the elevator door, and in the guttering light of torches you can see the glinting of hundreds of gold artifacts. It seems like half the gold in Europe is stored here!

^C[Olive]DESERTED
^c00The vaults are all locked, so you'll have to find a key. But where are the guards? You can't hear a single sound aside from your own breathing.

Gingerly you step forward into the dark halls of Totenhaus' underground catacombs to find a way into the vaults. Your footsteps echo like thunder in the empty labyrinth, but no one seems to hear you. Are you really alone?

Only one way to find out...
