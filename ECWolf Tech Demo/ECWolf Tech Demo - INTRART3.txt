^C[Olive]ONE WAY OUT
^c00The executive wing is guarded by Totenhaus' commandant, SS-Oberfuhrer Jurgen Luftmensch. He's loaded for bear and will turn you into pink mist if he catches you in the open.

The Nazis are on full alert and paratroopers are fanning out throughout the area to find you. Good luck--you'll need it!
