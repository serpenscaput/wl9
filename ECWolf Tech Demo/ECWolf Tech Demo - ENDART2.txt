^C[Olive]BRINGING DOWN THE HAUS
^c00Even the prototype "Tiger II" tank, the most powerful armored vehicle ever built, could stop your escape from Totenhaus. As the burning fuel from your flamethrower ignites its magazines, its turret blasts apart, raining shrapnel and debris onto the outer courtyard.

Behind you the mansion is burning. Its priceless treasures and rare artworks will never be recovered, but at least the dissidents and Allied operatives murdered in its depths have been avenged.
