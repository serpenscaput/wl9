Escape From SS Prison for Wolf 3D (Acorn/Archimedes version)
Ten new levels by Brian Lowe. Ronny Zeitz did the graphics and sounds for the PC version.

Thanks for downloading this set.  This has ten new levels (the first episode). The remaining five episodes have the levels from my first WolfBel set.

Unfortunately, the new vswap included in the PC version doesn't work on Acorn so I've included the original one. Many of the walls and objects have been re-edited from the PC version to reflect this.

This version will also work on the PC (registered set required), and will especially suit those who like playing with the original graphics. 

The set is fairly difficult, but not impossible to beat. There are a few keys in hidden rooms, and a few tricks here and there but the style  is otherwise fairly similar to that used in the original Wolfenstein 3D set. 

This set is available from my main web site at http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~brlowe. It is listed as 'Stand Alone' levels in the registered levels section. There are also more than one hundred other sets available, including many for 'Spear Of Destiny'.

Ronny can be contacted by email on ronny@ryho.org - and my email address is brian@brlowe.globalnet.co.uk - Brian.
