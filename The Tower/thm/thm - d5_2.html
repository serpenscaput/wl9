			Holding a cross, go north by east. Get past a "Dead Guard Trick" and a secret 
door and get the brass key in this cell. Then continue eastward past a death chalice.

			When the action starts in the south eastern hallway a super officer and two super 
SS will come at you from behind. Avoid stepping on the poison, and the water unless 
your health gets down to 20% or lower.

			Open this door, shoot the officer and the barrel ahead, then the mutant coming 
through the door ahead. Rush past the SS and super SS, one SS will follow you. Follow 
this path back to the western area.

			Shoot the enemies and barrels in this room and take the health chalices. You need 
to get through the poison filled western cells for the gold key.

			Shoot the barrels and finish off the enemies in the central hallway. Find more 
health in one of the eastern cells, but watch out for the mutant by the death chalices.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 85-32, 99-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Shoot the barrel by the gold door, open it and push the wall block. A super officer 
will immediately come at you from the elevator. This super officer may open the elevator 
door before you push the wall, in which case it will be possible to push the block 
eastward (and blocking the elevator). Make sure you never do this at any state.
