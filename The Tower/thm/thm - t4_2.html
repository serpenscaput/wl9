			Fight your way over here by the north corridor. Shoot the barrel by the death 
chalices, have the mutant coming and shoot him in the silver doorway. Put an end 
to the SS and take the health chalice.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 171-32, 65-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Push the rightmost wall block rightward and shoot the barrel, go back through 
the bronze door and shoot the mutant coming. Push the other wall blocks. You will 
have cleared the room you enter but look out for stray guards. Push the wall by the 
dead guard. Collect health chalices to get past the two bombs.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 197-32, 120-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Take this cross and continue west and south. But be on the lookout.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 186-32, 240-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Push these walls. The southern path leads you to a lot of health but you must 
fight a lot to get there. Take the single death chalice then the cross, step on the 
bomb, take the upper of the two death chalices and push the wall. Find a new cross 
on the way to the silver key near the elevator.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 141-32, 217-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Go past this pushwall (Dead Guard Trick).
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 62-32, 107-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Find two more crosses up here. Again take one at a time and make it south past 
the elevator to find the gold key by the columns.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 68-32, 137-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Shoot the innermost barrel in this room, put an end to any remaining super SS 
and get the cross. More guards will come from the north. Enter the elevator and take 
the death chalice, or take the death chalice by the many crosses and collect all 
the death chalices on the floor.
