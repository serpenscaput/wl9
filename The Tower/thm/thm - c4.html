			Take out the "sub" mutant and the guard with your knife. Shoot the SS and get 
his machine gun, there is an additional one here too and an ammo box a little to 
the south. Try to get them before finishing off the remaining enemies as the come.

			Beyond a "Dead Guard Trick" you get into the big southern room with explodable 
barrels. Get well into this room before opening fire at anyone or else the enemies 
in the south western room may be alarmed to early. And leave the barrels. Take up 
position in front of this unlocked door, open it, shoot the single barrel, kill the 
guards and go straight in. Then turn around and blow up the barrels as the many enemies 
from the south western room are coming. But look out for others coming from the room 
to the north.

			Make it into the south eastern hallway and open fire. Run back to this room and 
shoot enemies in any of the bronze doorways to gain access to the cross.

			Go past this death chalice and clean out the north eastern area. Then locate this 
pushwall by the health chalice.
