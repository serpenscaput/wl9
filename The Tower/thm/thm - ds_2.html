			Trying to enter the big central area through one of the unlocked doors will be 
next to impossible. You need a silver key.

			Go past the pushwall where you found the bronze key and take up position here. 
The next step is difficult but you can do it! Open the door and shoot the barrel, 
shoot the mutant coming through the next door, rush forward, another mutant is coming 
through the door behind you! But don't rush so quickly that you get killed by the 
exploding barrel! Find the silver key in the room ahead. If you didn't get to shoot 
the first mutant in the doorway, wait for the other, you still don't have the brass 
key.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 169-32, 121-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Enter the central area through the silver door. Stay unnoticed. To avoid being 
seen by the super officers in the corridors push the two blocks by the wooden barrels 
northward then the two southern blocks after them, thus creating two walls. Ignore 
the "sub" mutants behind the barrels. 
			</p>

			<p class="normal">
			Make it to the north western room past pushwalls. Have the "sub" mutants come 
in turns. Be sure the door is closed when you drop them.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 211-32, 73-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Then open the door and fire a shot. A super officer will appear through this brass 
door. Shoot him and rush through that door. Some mutants are waiting for you, drop 
them. Then try to kill as many as possible by blowing up the barrels. Make it past 
the ammo clips, some bombs are mingled with them. Clean out the whole area.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 84-32, 164-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			The brass key is here. Find a cross in the east. Go for the elevator.
