			There is a machine gun and ammo at the start. Find a chaingun in a nearby secret 
room. Fight the guards in the first hallways, acquire a missile launcher. Find reinforcements 
in two more secret rooms.

			Clean out this room (but know that more enemies will come from another part of 
the floor). Push the wall, open the door and fight the super officer. An SS will 
appear in the bronze doorway, kill him there.
			</p>			

			<p class="normal">
			There is a super SS behind the entrance. DON'T shoot him inside the elevator! 
Continue to the bronze key. Make it through the south eastern rooms for the silver 
key. Go through the entrance elevator pushwalls, fight the mutants for the brass 
key in the next room. More enemies will come. You have now access to the two southern 
rooms with crosses.

			Fighting these guards from the north is impossible. You must shoot the two barrels. 
With the brass key and a cross you can do it safely. Watch the bombs, shoot the next 
barrel, and finish with the remaining enemies.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 143-32, 79-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Get through the northern hallway for some extra ammo. Then go through here. IMPORTANT: 
Shoot the super SS while he is in the fake elevator, enemies will then come out of 
the two gold doors. Shoot at least one in one of the doorways! Go there past the 
pushwall by the crown.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 283-32, 86-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Shoot the SS behind the armor, and shoot the barrel, open the door. Fight hard 
for the gold key. Watch the super SS by the doors to the south. With the gold key 
and holding a cross, make it for the elevator.
