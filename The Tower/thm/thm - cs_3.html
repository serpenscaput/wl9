			Now you may go up to the the roof using one of the two elevators on the west side 
of the 3rd floor. Find an ammo box in the south western room on the roof. Or pick 
up missiles on the main part of the roof. But note: Not wasting ammo and missiles 
may prove necessary! From there you will get down to the south eastern room on the 
3rd floor.

			Find yourself here, to the left of the flag and the lamp. Go into the next room. 
Know that taking the missile immediately you will have to make a detour. Shoot the 
barrel. The first secrete door is only a path back to parts you have been to. The 
second (upper) secret door leads you to the silver key. Now take the elevator by 
the missile down to the ground floor.
