			Make it past this pushable block on your way to the elevator. Shoot the barrels 
in the next room and kill the super officer. Look out for all the super SS coming 
from all directions. Remember to have the super SS in the elevator open the silver 
door.

			Have enough health to get past the poison. Beyond the two pushwalls you lose your 
ammo. The five missile launchers make sure you will have exactly 10 missiles. You 
must kill all three super officers in the long corridor by blowing up the barrel 
in front of each of them, otherwise you will not have left enough missiles for all 
the explodable barrels ahead. And there is no way back!

			Beyond another "Dead Guard trick" you eventually get to this room. Alarm the guard 
but don't open fire. Get past the secret door, pick up ammo and missiles and make 
it through the next secret door. Open fire when a door to the room you came from 
is open. Then fight all the enemies coming from two directions. Kill some by blowing 
up the barrels. Get the treasure in the north western room.
