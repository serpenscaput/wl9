			The door is locked. You have to wait for the moving guard to come and open it. 
Defeat him but watch the SS standing to the left, right outside.

			Find a chaingun and a missile launcher here. Leave the barrels outside.

			You must get past all four locked doors in the central area to get to the elevator. 
Note that there is no silver key on the floor, you need to have the super SS in the 
elevator open the silver door. The keys are found in rooms that are blocked by death 
chalices. There are three crosses you may find in any order. Likewise the keys may 
be picked up in any order. Notice that there are additional rooms blocked with death 
chalices. It is vital that you don't pick up any wrong death chalice. The following 
describes one order in which you may get the crosses and the keys.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 86-32, 129-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Make sure you are low on ammo, or with 20% or lower on health, when passing the 
water. By the upper left missile you alarm the SS. Shoot him in the silver doorway 
and get the cross. Two pushwalls let you find the way to the health chalice behind 
the vase. One more lets you back.
			</p>

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 289-32, 51-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Find the gold key in this room.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 100-32, 235-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Shoot the super SS, then the barrel to wake up the mutant. Shoot him in the silver 
doorway. Run past the super SS behind the cages to the south. Shoot the next mutant 
and the barrels. Take care of any remaining super SS and the enemies in the room 
with the cross and the health chalice.
