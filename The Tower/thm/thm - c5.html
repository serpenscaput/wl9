			Wait till you know the officer has passed before opening the door. Don't open 
fire in the big room. When the officer moves through the bronze door to the south 
you will notice a guard opening another door further to the south.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 309-32, 88-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			If you are quick you can fetch a missile launcher here. Don't shoot the SS in 
the previous room while the door to the big room is open.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 194-32, 171-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Wait at the end of the wall with the bronze door and see an SS pass. Then go and 
take the chaingun, and hear the General's greeting! Soon missiles are flying in your 
direction.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 239-32, 270-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			When you know the officer has passed through this brass door, go through the unlocked 
door and wait for it to close. Then shoot the guards behind the tables. Turn around 
and shoot the officer when he returns through the brass door, and have it stay open.

			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 253-32, 150-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			The guard moving around in the big room is a nuisance, but don't shoot him yet. 
Make it here in time to see the first guard opening the bronze door to the east, 
and shoot him in the doorway. More guards will now come.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 225-32, 297-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Then get back down here in time to shoot the SS in this bronze doorway when he 
returns through it.
