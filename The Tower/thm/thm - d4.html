behind it. Kill the last super SS by blowing up the barrel.

to walk through the bombs later.

			Battle your way to the big hallway picking up ammunition on the way. In the big 
hallway don't shoot the barrels immediately, but stop by this ammo box. Then rush 
straight southward and past the pushwall.

			Fight your way northward for the gold key in this room. In the hallway north of 
the barrels, kill most of the super SS by blowing them up.

			Continue past the pushwall to the north. Find a cross and other reinforcements 
in a secret room in the north western corner of the floor.

			In this room you need to shoot an enemy right in front of the door north of the 
pushwall by the barrels. He will then block the second square north of the pushwall. 
When you push it, it will move only one square opening the path to the east without 
blocking the door to the north.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 163-32, 261-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Alarm the SS in this little corridor to perform the trick. Then make it to the 
south eastern corner of the floor to get the bronze key.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 151-32, 162-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Clean this room and get the brass key, watch the bomb. More enemies are coming. 
Find the elevator to the secret dungeon, still holding a cross.
