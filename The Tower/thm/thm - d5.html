			Push the wall behind you. Wade through the poison and the bomb and get the pistol. 
Shoot the barrel to the north. The pushwall behind the elevator door should now be 
movable. Kill the remaining mutant.
			</p>

			<p class="normal">
			Go through the next pushwall, get the health chalices. Go south through the poison. 
Get one cross and more health, don't take the crowns now, a mutant will see you. 
Go through the corridor south of the SS, reinforce. Have the door close before killing 
the "sub" mutants. Go through the north western corridor, take the machine gun. Have 
the 6 mutants follow you back to the northern hallway in turns. The door to the corridor 
must be closed when you shoot them. (Slide to avoid being hit too much.)

			Make it here unnoticed. Take the missile launcher, shoot the barrels. On "Death 
Incarnate" the super officers behind the wall will only be stunned. Rush in and take 
the chaingun and ammo. Fight for your life!
			</p>			

			<p class="normal">
			After taking the bronze key in the area you just cleaned out, go back and clean 
out the opening area. Then get another cross in the treasure room.
			</p>			

			<p class="normal">
			Run through the central hallway. Push the wall block at the southern end northward. 
Fight the enemies in the nearby western and eastern areas.

			Find the silver key here. Push a wall for a later short cut to the elevator.

			You may try to shoot these barrels at close range. But it may cost you your life. 
Find a brass key instead.
