			Get the machine gun. Turn around, fire a shot and kill the super SS coming from 
behind. Beware a mutant past the barrels to the north. Shoot the barrel on the corner, 
this will wake up the SS behind the pushwall. Shoot him in the silver door. Then 
shoot the barrel you see to the south. Go past the pushwall. Then past the next one 
to the east.

			Make it here for the bronze key. Then push the wall by the health chalice. Kill 
the mutant behind it. Open the door to the north.

			Kill the guards coming out of the door ahead. Shoot the barrels in that room to 
kill the super SS.

			Go here and shoot the barrel by the death chalices to wake up the mutant. Shoot 
him and push the wall.		</p>

			Blowing up the barrels past the next door will be difficult if you have not already 
done so (see the first paragraph). Don't shoot the mutant ahead but have him open 
the silver door, then shoot him in the doorway. Get the brass key.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 148-32, 141-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Push this cell door. Shoot the barrel and the super SS some way to the north past 
the columns (and other enemies that appear). Find health and ammo past the next door. 
On your way back be aware more enemies coming at you.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 268-32, 110-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Get this cross and go north past the nearby death chalice.
