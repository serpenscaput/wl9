			Again you start by losing your ammo. Kill the southern "sub" mutant with your 
knife, try to ignore the northern one, then kill the guard in this brass doorway 
when he opens the door. Take his pistol and shoot the mutant. Then go for the cross. 
Now you may finish with the other "sub" mutant.

			Watch the SS by the green barrels. Run past the mutants. Don't shoot the barrels! 
Take what health you need. Make it back past the pushwall.

			Past the death chalice try to finish the SS with your knife. Take his machine 
gun and the extra ammo. Shoot the barrel. Kill the super officer. Take the brass 
key but beware the mutant around the corner.

			Clean the north western room for the bronze key and reinforcements. Then open 
the bronze door in the north and make fire. Kill the guards coming through the silver 
door, and those coming from the room to the south by blowing up the barrels. Find 
the silver key in that room.

			Battle the guards in this area. Shoot the first barrel, then the SS in the room 
with the crown. Then shoot the barrels by the southern gold doors when another SS 
opens the door to the room with the cross.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 261-32, 121-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Open this door and defeat the enemies in that room. But be aware the super SS 
coming through the elevator door behind the columns as well as other surprises from 
behind.
