			Past this "Dead Guard Trick" you will lose your ammo. Push the wall in the next 
hallway and shoot the barrel when the guard opens the door next to it. But be on 
the look out for the super SS coming through the next door. Follow this path to the 
big square room.

			Kill this SS and get past the pushwall. (One of the two water puddles will drain 
your ammo unless you are at 17% health or lower.)

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 170-32, 146-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Pick up the extra missiles up here. Avoid being hit by the enemies ahead and kill 
the guard by shooting the barrel, but make sure he does NOT fall where he initially 
stood (so he doesn't block the upper pushwall). Push the wall blocks. Then shoot 
the barrel you see past the death chalice. Step back a little and watch the show.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 137-32, 115-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Find a cross past this pushwall (you need it to get back to the western part of 
the floor, see the last paragraph).

			Clean out the rest of this area if you want to. It's quite tough though. In the 
room at the south eastern corner of the floor you find another cross for the death 
chalice situated where you started the barrel explosions.

			Get back through this secret door and past the death chalice.
