			Rush forward for the machine gun, turn around quickly and shoot the mutant behind 
you. Push the cell door for a health chalice. Don't get surprised by the next mutant 
hiding a little to the west.

			In the next room make sure you get north of the barrels in time to shoot them 
when the enemies are coming at you. Be aware more guards coming and the two mutants 
hiding in the next little room.
			</p>

			Move to the room with the many bronze doors. Shoot the barrel behind these columns 
to wake up an officer. Run back, push the wall block and shoot the officer in the 
brass doorway. Enter and take only one cross.
			</p>

			Make sure you have enough health to pass the poison. Push the wall blocks and 
shoot the barrel in the little room. This will alarm some SS.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 169-32, 268-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Be back here when the SS open the bronze door to the south. Shoot him in the doorway, 
be aware one or two more SS behind him but hurry into that room, the mutants to the 
north are coming at you! Make it into the corridor leading west, one of the SS may 
still be there. Then start to clean out the mutants. You may run out of ordinary 
ammo, shoot them with missiles and pick up their ammo.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 267-32, 295-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Continue past this death chalice. Find the bronze key a little to the north.
			</p>			

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 229-32, 240-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Fetch the second cross by the eastern columns, then make it here. Shoot the super 
SS behind the bronze door, get the gold key.
