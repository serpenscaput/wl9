Thanks for downloading CRUDE, the humpteenth mod by Thomas Weiling.

The mod was made over the course of five days and contains 4 levels. Levels are found in EPISODE 4.

STORYLINE

An evil pimp by the name of Doktor Phancypantz is abducting and cloning young girls for his wicked webcam empire.

As it is obvious that BJ Blazkowicz would make the girls swoon and surrender immediately, it was decided to hire somebody who would make it a more challenging mission.
As such, a dull-faced man suffering from resting bitch face syndrome coupled with the personality of a cardboard box was chosen instead: DOOMGUY.

CREDITS

I took a lot of stuff, all this is credited on the intro screen. Biggest thanks go to Mr. Choi who I have learned to appreciate in my advanced age.

Also took the lovely remix AstroCreep made of The Healer Stalks from OVERKILL. Can't get enough of that track.
