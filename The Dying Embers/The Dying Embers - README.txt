Thank you for downloading THE DYING EMBERS, a Wolfenstein 3D mod by Thomas Weiling.

The set features 30 new levels, and replaces the first three episodes. In connection with Wolfenstein 3D's anniversary I found it fitting to make my personal spin on the storyline of the first three episodes. I have taken some liberties, however. A handful of new graphics appear, mainly from Spear of Destiny and its Mission Packs. One wall texture was originally made by Zach Higgins.

Enjoy!

===EDITORS USED===
MapEdit 8.4 by Bill Kirby & Co. (Maps)
ChaosEdit by Ripper & Chaos Software (Graphics)
