
Finally!

The DieHard Wolfers TC                                    25 September 2011


This is a Wolfenstein 3-D mod started way back in late 2003 by Ringman. Initiated 
by 
an idea thrown out by Aryan_expirement, it was intended to be made with contributions 

from as many DieHard Wolfer Forum members as possible. It didn't quite turn out to 
be
a Total Conversion, and the majority of the work done in its heyday in 2004-2005 
was 
probably done by 6 or so people, but the full credits list is quite impressive 
nevertheless.

The game and the story have some twists and surprises for even the most jaded Wolf3d

players. And a well-worn piece of advice for everyone: save often! The game can be 

quite challenging in places, and you may wish you could go back and try again without

losing your weaponry and ammo.

Many thanks go to id Software for releasing the source code, and to Brian Lowe 
(Schabbs) for hosting this mod and the dozen levels he contributed to it.

We hope you enjoy the fruits of our labor...
