Assassin level 3 bugfixes.

Whoops, sorry i forgot to add an elevator so you could exit the level. Also
i had by accident placed 2 start positions so you ended up starting at what
should be the end of level 3. Finally i added 2 locked doors for the silver
key, now at last everything should be corrected.

Made some small adjustements to 2 other levels
