These are the programs who made it possible for me to make Assasin.

1. Maped84.zip Mapedit 8.4. Made by Bryan Baker, Dave Huntoon, Warren Buss. 
   Used it only to zap the floorcodes.

5. Unp412b.zip Unp 412. Made by Ben Castricum. Shareware.
   The best exe & com decompressor i have tried, it can handle a huge 
   collection of different compressors.
   
6. Vc400.zip Volkov Commander 4.00. Vsevolod V. Volkov. Freeware.
   Magnificient commander for DOS, hexedited the .exe file with it & edited
   most .txt files.

7. Upx120d.zip Upx 1.04. Made by Markus Oberhumer, Lazlo Molnar. Freeware.
   A command line exe compressor, 1 of the best programs in it's category.
   
8. Wolf3d14.zip Wolfenstein 3d Registered. Made by ID software. Shareware.
   Go out & order the game on www.idsoftware.com.

9. Bat2ex15.zip Bat2exec 1.5. Made by Douglas Boling. Freeware.
   A nice & simple .bat to .com converter, i used it to make the start file
   fearwolf.com.

10. Auror30c.zip Aurora 3.0c. Made by nuText Systems. Shareware.
    The best editor made for DOS, edited most .txt files with it.

11. Com2exe.zip. Com2exe v1.0. Made by Joergen Ibsen / Jibz, Arkady
    V.Belousov.
    Used it to make the start.exe file.

12. Sdmedit.zip Sdmedit v1.0. Made by K. Van den Helm. Much faster than
    mapedit, when i just quickly wants to check out a single level and want's
    to ward off some small bugs. Made some small levels changes with it,
    otherwise it was mostly used for exporting/importing/deleting levels.

Note all the programs are DOS-programs, they should however work fine under
the various Windows-systems.
