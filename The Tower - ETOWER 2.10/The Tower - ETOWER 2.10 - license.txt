ETOWER V2.1.

This version of The Tower, called etower.exe, is meant for add-on makers.
All features from The Tower are included with the exception of some hard coded features found in levels 14 and 20 of The Tower. Making add-ons with these features would have strange and erroneous results in these two levels.

To make add-ons to The Tower you are obliged to use the VGA files included in this package.
You are to make one change to the Vgagraph. Where it says 'Your name' in the credit screen, replace that with your name.

Put all the files in this package into a new directory, copy the remaining game files from your Tower directory.
Now you may start to edit Gamemaps.
The package includes customized versions of the mapedit files Mapdata and Objdata.

Due to the fact that the Wolf3D/Spear resource files are copyrighted, any released add-on to The Tower must require that the player owns a registered version of Spear of Destiny. The way to achieve that in this instance is to not include the audiohed file in the released package.
IMPORTANT:
If you want to release add-ons based on The Tower, you must contact me first.

Good luck, and have fun making new levels for The Tower.
