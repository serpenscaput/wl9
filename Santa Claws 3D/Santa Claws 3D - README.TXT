 Merry Christmas! 

 Why didn't I use 'DOOM' instead of 'Wolf 3D'? Simple. Wolf 3D fits on one
 disk and is a smaller d/l. Also, I really doubt that this 'edit' will, in
 any way, cut into 'Wolf 3D' sales. This was all for fun. I really enjoyed
 putting it together, and I hope it's equally fun to play.

 PS- And to those of you who observe equally important festivities 
     this time of year, 

                HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND BEST WISHES TO YOU ALL!
