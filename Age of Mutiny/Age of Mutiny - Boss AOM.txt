* * * Lost boss level: The Age Of Mutiny * * *

Version 1.1 (has bugfix for folks running it in the WolfDX demo)

This pair of files has one boss level from my lost mod "Age Of Mutiny".  It'll run 
in both the Shareware and the Commercial version of Wolf3D.  I recommend you run 
it in WolfDX though, as the map takes advantage of Guard Blocks, so guards won't 
open doors they shouldn't.  It'll also rid you of the "disappearing objects" bug.


This is *not* a recovered map.  It's one I re-created from memory, at the request 
of a fellow Wolfer.

It's not one of my better maps, but the first hallway and the boss sequence aren't 
bad.  The boss sequence is still *very* mean though, so I've added one 1-UP to give 
the player a fighting chance.

The Shareware limitations of this map are obvious.  For one thing, there's enough 
SS in this map to tide you over for quite a while.  Enjoy.  :-)

P.S.  All Pushwalls have a wreath or eagle sticker.  You might need to push one before 
going into the "SS corridor".
