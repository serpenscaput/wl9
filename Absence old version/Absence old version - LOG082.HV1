^C01 re: Shipment arrived!

^C04 We finally got the newly invented MGX 2704 from Beta Labs Sector 1. I deposited 
the weapon in our storage room. Since the tragic occurrence in Beta Labs Sector 3, 
we can't have enough weapons down here. I'll try everything to avoid such an accident 
in future! My next precaution is to hire more security guards or drones.....
