WOLFENSTEIN: GROSSED OUT

 WELCOME TO CASTLE GOTTENHEIMER. IT IS 1945 AND B.J. HAS RECIEVED, FROM AN ALLIED 
SOURCE, 
THE RATHER UNPLEASANT NEWS THAT HANS GROSSE HAS BEEN SIGHTED IN A DUSSELDORF
PUB. DESPITE YOUR SURPRISE,(YOU KILLED HIM,RIGHT?) YOU TAKE OFF FOR DUSSELDORF 
TO INVESTIGATE...IT SEEMS THAT THE MANIACAL DR. SCHABBS HAD MANY EVIL EXPERIMENTS 
GOING ON
AND EVEN THOUGH HE IS DEAD TOO, HIS EVIL GOES ON...HE HAD CLONED AN ARMY OF DIFFERENT 
MUTANTS,
BUT HIS CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT WAS HANS GROSSE!   GO NOW TO THE CASTLE AND FIND ALL 
THE CLONES, BLOW THEM
TO HELL AND BE RID OF THE EVIL THAT SCHABBS WAS GOING TO UNLEASH...


YOU HAVE ONLY ONE MISSION: KILL THE CLONES AND ESCAPE THE HELLHOLE OF THE CASTLE!

BEWARE, BECAUSE THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS AS THEY SEEM...HANS COULD BE ANYWHERE OR ANYPLACE!


This is a first attempt at level construction.
no cheat codes...
Many thanks to Brian Lowe for his help.
This game is best when played in the "bring'em on" mode or "death" mode. Of course!


Thanks to I.D. Software for creating such a cool game!

This game is based on the shareware version 1.4, all the required files to
play are included in the zip. Just unzip and click on the "wolf3d" dosbox.

It retains the original titlescreen and menu etc.....

Thanks for playing.......john_bucksnort (at) yahoo.com
