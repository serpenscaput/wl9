Thanks for downloading!
Patch your Wolfenstein GBA ROM with the included IPS file.
This can be done with Lunar IPS, or a similar tool.

NOTE:
The episode select screen shows 3 available episodes, however only the first 2 are available, as Dresden Strike and A Dark Secret have both been merged into Episode 1. I apologize for the inconvenience.
