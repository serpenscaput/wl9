<FONT FACE="Courier New">The prisoners were going in front of you. They knew they 
were going to die. Calmly, they came to the wall. Their eyes were looking at you 
with hate. You stopped and pulled out your gun. One loud shot. They were all lying 
dead on the floor. Blood splattered over the wall. You saw Satan in front of your 
eyes, laughing, laughing, laughing. You didn't even notice when the three other soldiers 
turned and walked a few steps, chatting with each other. You gazed blindly at the 
blood, still faces, holes in the bodies. Then someone shouted - &quot;Hey, are you 
coming, or not?! We have eight more to do!&quot; You turned round and aimed at him 
with your gun. - &quot;Yes, I am coming. For you, son of a bitch!&quot;
