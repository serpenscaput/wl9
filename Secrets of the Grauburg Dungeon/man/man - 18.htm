<FONT FACE="Courier New">I would like to apologize to Apogee which asked not to publish 
shareware addons - I read about it when SotGD was nearly completed and I didn't want 
to waste all the work that was put into it. Please forgive me.<BR><BR>If you like 
this addon you may also try my previous one, &quot;Project: Weltuntergang&quot; - 
it was a good TC (03'2002 Wolfenstein 3D Dome Award) with 60 levels and many graphics, 
sound and source changes (for instance a motorbike).<BR><BR>My next planned addon 
will probably be &quot;Silent Assault&quot;, already mentioned in &quot;Project: 
Weltuntergang&quot; readme and in the <a href="http://www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk" target="_blank">Wolfenstein 
3D Dome</a> news archives. I'm also dreaming of making a RPG based on Wolfy's engine, 
but as for now it's only a dream...
