<FONT FACE="Courier New">Your name is Otto Gelb, 21. You were born in 1919 in a Catholic 
German family. Your childhood wasn't very easy, but you can't say it wasn't happy. 
All your problems started when Hitler came to power in 1933. You were fascinated 
with his ideas, but too young to join his cause.<BR>When your mother discovered that 
you had killed a Jude, she became afraid of you. She was a good woman, who believed 
in God in a way you never could. She tried to persuade you out from having Nazi ideas, 
but the propaganda was stronger.<BR>"It's the happiest day in my whole life" - you 
thought, when in 1937 you joined the army. You liked army life very much. There was 
always enough food, while at home you sometimes even had to starve. And there was 
a lot of people who thought like you and who were ready to lose their lives for F&uuml;hrer.</FONT>
