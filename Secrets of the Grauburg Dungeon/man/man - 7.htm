<FONT FACE="Courier New">After examining the dungeons, he returned to his quarters. 
There was a need for a secret intelligence base and officers residence. Hitler decided 
for Grauburg, but he still felt there's some mystery to be discovered in those dungeons. 
Soon exploration was stopped and a builder crew arrived at the site. The ancient 
dungeons were converted into a intelligence base, with a small prison for enemies 
important because of their knowledge.<BR> 
In November 1939 a guard was walking on the deepest level of the base when the floor 
collapsed under his feet. He fell into a small room with a staircase entrance. The 
fourth level was discovered! Scientists soon found entrances to two deeper levels, 
which were much more interesting than the first three.<BR> 
But there were more and more prisoners coming to the base and there was not enough 
space for them, so at the beginning of 1940 Hitler decided to build two additional 
prison levels.
