<FONT FACE="Courier New">Thanks for downloading Secrets of the Grauburg Dungeons 
- an addon for the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D. SotGD is not a Total Conversion 
addon, so it doesn't have any source changes, but all the maps (10, exactly) and 
many of the graphics and sounds have been replaced. You have to supply <I>wolf3d.exe</I> 
file from the 1.4 shareware version of Wolfenstein to run SotGD. 
I created SotGD, because I wanted to show the Wolfenstein world, that it is possible 
to create a good addon without any source changes. (OK, I'm lying - I just didn't 
have enough time for editing the source ;-)). I tried to make the game have a new 
feeling, different from the colorful Wolf3D - I used more gray, brown and less blue, 
violet or red. I think it looks pretty nice.</FONT></TR>
