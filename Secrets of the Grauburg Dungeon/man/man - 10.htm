<FONT FACE="Courier New">"How stupid I was!" - you are thinking now. In September 
1939 the war began. Thousands of German soldiers attacked Poland. It seemed so beautiful 
to fight, fight for a better life for your children.  But it didn't last for long. 
You were hurt in your leg and chest during a small battle near some little village. 
You were taken to a field hospital. There you saw human pain and suffering. But you 
still could understand it, you were proud of being hurt for your country.<BR>It took 
you five months to get back to full health. How disappointed you were when a message 
came for you. You were being moved to some village in the Alps, where you would serve 
as a guard. So there wouldn't be battles anymore. No more fighting! You would sit 
in some chair, listen to the radio and get bored. There probably wouldn't even be 
any pretty girls. Grauburg, a hole of a place!</FONT>
