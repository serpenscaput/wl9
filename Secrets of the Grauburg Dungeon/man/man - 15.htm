<FONT FACE="Courier New">At evening you gathered your thoughts. The best moment to 
start your escape was the prisoners execution. The walls would stifle the sounds 
of fight, so you'll be able to kill the other guards. What next? You'll think about 
it later. There were eight underground levels. After getting out of them, you'll 
have to run through the town, steal a truck and ride away... Sounds easy, but it 
won't be. But, what about the ninth level, the newly discovered one? Maybe the evil 
power that causes all your problems lies somewhere on that level? No matter if it 
serves Nazis or Allies, evil should be destroyed. You just feel it. Maybe it's your 
mission, given by the God? And will simply running away help? Maybe your nightmares 
will follow you... So, if possible you should find the entrance to the ninth level. 
Someone told you it's behind a locked door in the digging area. Worth trying...
