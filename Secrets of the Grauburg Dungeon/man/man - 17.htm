<FONT FACE="Courier New">Here should begin the section of after-level texts. After 
you have finished some level you would read the appropriate text. Your story would 
depend on whether you went to the deepest, tenth level or not. But as you see it 
isn't so. Why? Well, after weeks of trying to make up some fine story, although I 
had myriads of ideas, I finally managed to create texts for 7 levels. But I didn't 
really like them - what I produced was a rather poor psychological drama about fear, 
madness and anger with some very private thoughts and I just didn't want to share 
it with all the world. Having no will to start writing it again from the beginning 
I decided to finish the story in a different way. I want each player who likes the 
game and has a good idea for completing the story to send me a mail. I'm waiting 
especially for complete stories but just some ideas would also be appreciated. After 
reading it all and maybe mixing up a bit I will release the final version of SotGD.
