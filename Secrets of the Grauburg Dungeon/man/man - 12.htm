<FONT FACE="Courier New">The prisoners you tortured and killed appeared in your dreams. 
You had strange visions and begun to feel fear when being alone. You thought it just 
were qualms of conscience. You thought it would disappear, when you got used to your 
new way of life. But it didn't. And then some guard discovered an entrance to a new 
dungeon level. Your dreams were even more frightening, sometimes you couldn't sleep.<BR>

And there was another mystery. Why were there so many elite soldiers in such a little 
hole. Half of these men would be enough to guard this little prison. Of course, the 
prisoners were very important, but you thought there had to be some secret they were 
guarding. Maybe it was the old dungeons? But you thought it made no sense. You were 
sure it's all just your ill imagination.<BR>
