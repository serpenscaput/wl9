<FONT FACE="Courier New">A week after the archeologist's death some new scientist 
arrived. Soldiers told you he was one of Himmler's best friends, a well known SS 
officer and historian. After his arrival, only his trusted guards were allowed to 
go to the deepest level. A lot of scientists came with the officer. They were asking 
about anything unusual. You wanted to tell them about your dreams, but the following 
day, every guard, who saw the violet light, wasn't in his bed. Strangely, you knew 
they were dead.<BR>
Keeping your symptoms a secret had been a good idea. Someone, who was on his pass 
in the town, said he saw the bodies of the missing guards being packed on a truck 
and taken somewhere in the mountains. He probably was lying, but it really didn't 
matter. Your visions were too strong. You could not think. The only thing you wanted 
to do was to escape from this hell. Where to? Mountains, forest, allies prison or 
even grave. Anywhere, but not here!
