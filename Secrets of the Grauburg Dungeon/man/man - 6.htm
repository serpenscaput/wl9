<FONT FACE="Courier New">Herman tried several times to get money for exploration 
of these terrains, but he achieved nothing. He lost his interest in Grauburg until 
February 1938, when a bunch of SS soldiers took him from his bed right to  Hitler's 
quarters.<BR> 
He entered the conference room. F&uuml;hrer was sitting at the table. "Sit down, 
please". - he said - "We have to discuss the Grauburg question".<BR> 
In March exploration began. F&uuml;hrer was known of his interest in magic and occultism. 
Herman knew, that he was expecting some unusual discoveries. But for the first few 
months nothing happened. Then, in July, some archeologist found an entrance to the 
first level of dungeons, then the second and third level were found. But they were 
empty. The only things found were a little gold, some statues and human skeletons. 
In August F&uuml;hrer himself arrived at the site.</FONT>
