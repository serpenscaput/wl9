<FONT FACE="Courier New">Grauburg is a little town somewhere in the Alps. It was 
founded in 987. In 1023 it was invaded by some tribe from the East, which built a 
giant underground sanctuary. They  made bloody sacrifices for their gods - animal 
and human sacrifices. According to the legends, the mysterious tribe disappeared 
after an earthquake, which had partially destroyed their sanctuary. Since then, Grauburg 
was a peaceful place for hundreds of years and the old sanctuary was forgotten.<BR> 

In 1935 a young German archeologist, Herman Blausteiner, arrived to Grauburg with 
his family for their holidays. One day when he was walking in the nearby mountains, 
he found a small golden skull. After examining it he found out, that it had been 
created hundreds of years before.</FONT>
