<FONT FACE="Courier New">In June 1940 the new levels were nearly completed. Herman 
Blausteiner was looking at the digging workers when he saw some gray stones coming 
out of the ground. "Stop digging!" - he shouted. Archeologists were called to the 
deepest level. They discovered a staircase and an untouched level of dungeons.<BR>Herman 
Blausteiner was walking home from the Grauburg's Inn, when he felt that someone is 
watching him. He turned, but it was dark and he couldn't see a thing. He began to 
walk faster, then he started running. A moment later he hit into something big and 
fell down. A black figure came closer to him and crouched. He felt a cold blade on 
his neck. "So they found out" - he thought.<BR>Next day, the body of Herman Blausteiner 
was found. It was massacred and his house was robbed. The official version was that 
he was killed by drunk soldiers. He was buried in a nearby cemetery and three soldiers 
were executed.</FONT>
