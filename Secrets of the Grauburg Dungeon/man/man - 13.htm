<FONT FACE="Courier New">You were going to sleep when guards from the newly discovered, 
ninth dungeon level arrived in the room. You saw fear in their eyes. They had a glass 
of Schnapps, illegally smuggled into the prison for special occasions, and started 
talking. They said about strange violet light flashes coming from a closed room and 
terrible, inhuman screams.<BR>
Since then your dreams turned into horrible nightmares. You saw devil, prisoners, 
blood. Then the Jude you had killed returned. His voice, the look of his eyes were 
filling your mind all the time. <BR>
Then you heard about an archeologist Herman Blausteiner being killed. You recalled 
it was the one, who sometimes visited the dungeons. You had even seen him once. They 
said some soldiers did it. But something in your mind told you it wasn't soldiers.<BR>
