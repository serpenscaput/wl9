^C7d Electric Gates

^C2a Due to the secrecy of the Test Labs, Lord Edward has ordered an increase of security. To that end, we are installing more electric gates, in addition to access cards. Each electric gate will be controlled remotely by a squad leader. These squad leaders will report regularly to the security checkpoint. If any unauthorized personnel gain entry to the Test Labs, the security force in question will be subject to court-martial, torture, and execution.
