Description             : The Sequel to Wolfenstein: Machines of Death and
                          last of the trilogy. This Total Conversion is a
                          homage to my favorite Wolfenstein 3d mods,
                          specifically WSJ's Castle Totenkopf SDL, and all
                          the WolfenDoom TC throughout the years.
                          
                          I hope you enjoy the epic conclusion this
                          Wolfenstein adventure.
                          
                          Get Psyched!
