48,
The fight against the two cyberdemons is over and you are triupmphant! Eventhough 
the Mars City is now cleared of those demons you still feel no joy. Once again you 
witnessed the horrible of fate of the people who lived in this space station.\p 


Again a portal opened in front of you. Hopefully this time it would take you unto 
hell itself because you have so much to avenge! You will make sure that no demon 
will survive. After the teleportation you noticed the blood red skies and what appeared 
to be Mount Erebus in the horizon. It was pretty clear to you that you had arrived 
to hell. Now you are to find the cyberdemons leading the demons of hell...
