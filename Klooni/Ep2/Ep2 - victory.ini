77,
After a long and bloody fight the gigantic Cyberdemon is finally defeated. The demons 
seemed to have killed every citizen in this town. That enraged you! The portal from 
where the cyberdemon came was still open.\p 

You stepped through the portal and looked around. You weren't in the hell but on 
an unknown planet. You saw a huge fortress in the distance which apparently wasn't 
built by humans. You started walking towards the entrance with only one thought in 
your mind: The forces of hell shall pay dearly for what they did to the people of 
this town!
