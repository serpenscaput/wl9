65,
After you defeated the Barons of Hell the portal opened. You checked the coordinates 
from the computer and you were shocked! 
The teleportation coordinates were set to a small town on earth.\p 

You can only hope that these demons haven't teleported there yet 
and if they have hopefully the citizens are still ok. You entered the portal and 
prepared yourself for the challenges waiting for you...
