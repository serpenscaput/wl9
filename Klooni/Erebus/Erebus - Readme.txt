Excursion to Erebus


10 hard maps for Klooni

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Basic information:

 Completed: 19.12.2008
  Released: 31.7.2011
  Episodes: 1
      Maps: 10
Difficulty: From Hard to Very Hard
    Klooni: 1.3 and newer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Story:

You are sent to investigate a distress call that from UAC outpost on Hell,
but things don't quite work out the way it was supposed to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Build time:

Hard to say, I started this about the same time Megabyte started his Demonoid
trilogy. I finished the first nine maps in a decent time, but then I just left
it collecting dust for a very long time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Notes:

This has been waiting for the release of 1.3 patch. Finally after release of
Klooni SDL, these maps finally get to see the light of day. There is an Episode 2

being planned, hopefully it won't take as long to complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How to play:

- Requires Klooni 1.3 or newer!
- Extract this package to your Klooni folder.
- Start by launching it from the Custom Game menu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Credits:

- Mapping: Codetech
- Megabyte for helping me create Klooni in the first place and testing this one!

I hope I get myself to continue this series with more maps.


Take care,
