246,

Looks like something got through before you got the chance to destroy the portal.\p 


Now that the demon is dead and the portal is destroyed, you should finally be able 
to breathe easy.\p Atleast for now...\p 

Thank you for everyone who played it through and enjoyed it, this was my first experiment 
in mapping. Hopefully I find the enthusiasm to make another one day.\p - Codetech84
