189,

You have found the last remaining UAC outpost, This could be 
your ticket out of here. The base has been abandoned for a few decades, 
but the portal is still operational. The technology is pretty outdated, so 
preparing the teleporter might take longer than expected.\p 

The survivors of our recon team are allready there and are under orders 
to hold ground until you arrive...
