--Demonoid - A very hard Klooni mapset--




Story: Heh, no story in this one since there's no actual connection between maps.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Build time: I started this one when Klooni was released. Work was pretty slow because 
I wasn't happy with some maps so I redid them many times until I was satisfied. So 
now there is 10 very hard maps for Klooni.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




How to play?: - Extract this package to your klooni folder.
	      - Start the .bat file and get ready to blast some demons.
