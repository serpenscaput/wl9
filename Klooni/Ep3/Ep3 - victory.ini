31,
The cyberdemon who led the demons of this forgotten fortress is defeated! His roar 
still echoed around the huge black tower. A portal appeared inside the tower. You 
had no idea where that portal would lead you. \p 

After going through that portal you realized that you were on somekind of space station. 
Just when you thought you would find friendly humans the sound of former humans made 
you realize that demons had invaded this space station too! Now that they know that 
you are here there's no turning back...
