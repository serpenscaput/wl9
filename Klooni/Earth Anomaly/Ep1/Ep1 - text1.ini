48,
After a hectic run through the long, dim, twisting corridor, you open the elevator's 
door, quickly jump inside, and with your heart heavily pounding, you close the door 
behind you. Then, struggling to breathe and calm yourself down, you sit down on the 
cold floor. 
What kind of nightmare is this? What was this monster which you had to fight in this 
glowing, hellish chamber? What the HELL is going on? Battling well-trained and armed 
men, who perhaps were once your friends, was difficult enough to take on one person, 
but the encounter with this wicked creature could easily be fatal to you. In a sudden 
rush of determination, you get up and press the elevator's button, knowing that there 
is only one way - forward.
