48,
Steel bunker. Steel bunker. Steel bunker. Before, you welcomed their sight with relief, 
but now, after barely making it alive through all those closed, sterile rooms and 
corridors, including your hardest battle yet in a labyrinth filled with toxic liquids, 
you can't help but to curse those familiar, yet unknown walls. And now, there is 
again steel around you, grey, metallic, claustrophobic. Will this ever end? Or is 
this maze endless? Is this where you'll find your grave?
