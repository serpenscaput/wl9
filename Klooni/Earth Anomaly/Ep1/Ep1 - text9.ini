65,
Another challenge beaten, and the UAC complex walls are back even faster than you 
would think. After coming out of the elevator, the strange feeling of being in a 
place known, and yet unknown, is gone, too. The surroundings are now familiar and 
untouched. You're on this complex' lowest underground level and normally, there would 
be nowhere to go from here, but now, you can't be sure. The air is hot and heavy, 
which is not what you'd expect here. With your eyes closed, you can feel the presence 
of a powerful being somewhere close. Contemplating this, you almost miss the fact 
that there's an enemy in front of you. You can't let the concentration slip away, 
not now.
