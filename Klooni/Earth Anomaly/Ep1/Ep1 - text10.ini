65,
This was a bitter fight, but you managed to end it victorious again. Your last foe, 
a powerful, flaming humanoid, now lies dead at your feet, and you almost sense a 
kind of loss when looking at its corpse. But this is no time to feel pity for defeated 
enemies, especially when they know no mercy themselves.\p 

As you enter the last steel room, you notice that a portal appeared in a niche, a 
portal larger than the ones which you encountered before. You hesitate before entering 
it, but then you remind yourself that it's the only way to go. Bitterly, you step 
in to meet your fate.
