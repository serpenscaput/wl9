48,
Things are getting worse. This time, the familiar walls of your UAC complex were 
barely present. Most of the time, you had to fight in a hellish enviromnent, and 
with hellish enemies. But you still have hope in your heart. As the elevator plunges 
down, you're anxious to see what is on the other side of its door.\p 

The sight makes your heart crumble instantly. Green brick, slime, putrid stench in 
the air, and blood, blood on the floor. Apparently, the whole place is now under 
THEIR control.\p 

You clench your teeth and make the greatest effort of calming yourself down again. 
You can't fight for your life with tears in eyes.
