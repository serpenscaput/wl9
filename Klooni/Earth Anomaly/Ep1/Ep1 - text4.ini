48,
After a long struggle, you finally made it to the elevator, but now, a great unrest 
is rising in you. The feeling is difficult to bear, and you're forced to stop.\p 


With a silent grind, the elevator comes to a halt, signaling that it reached its 
destination, but you can't make yourself open its door. The fear of what might be 
on the second side is overwhelming. On the other hand, you already fought many vile, 
wretched beasts. Perhaps you're used enough to their sight. But you aren't sure.\p 


After a short inner struggle, you decide to open the door... Nooo! Quick! The portal! 
The portal!
