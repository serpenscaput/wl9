48,
Just a few minutes ago, you had hope again. Now, it's shattered. Again. Just when 
you thought that your enemy is weak, a coordinated attack centered on your frail 
body brought you back to the ground. At least it's already over, with you victorious 
again. Slowly, you enter the portal.\p 

After all those nightmares, the cold, steel walls almost seem to be a paradise. However, 
the sight right in front of you is highly unpleasant. You'll better take care.
