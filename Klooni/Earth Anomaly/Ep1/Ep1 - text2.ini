48,
Although you are still surrounded by solid, stone and steel walls of UAC complex, 
you don't remember this place. Nothing seems familiar. And it appears that the unknown 
foes you're fighting are transforming the surroundings. Already there are torches, 
lighting up everything with their weird flames, instead of usual lampposts. This 
doesn't help. And then, the horrible, claustrophobic, wooden room, the spacious, 
extensive chamber with walls of green and demon paintings everywhere, and beasts, 
unlike anything you've ever seen... You can't find enough words to describe them, 
and every thought makes you shiver. But you must push onwards.
