                            Selecting new games

Select new games by choosing menu item #4 from the Main Menu.  This will
take you to the Select New Game Menu.  The new games are listed in this
menu, including how many levels the new games include.  Selecting a new
game also backs up your savegames for the game you were playing before, and
restores your savegames for the new game you select, if they exist.  Each
game you may select (A-Z, AA-VV, and your original WOLF3D game) can have
up to 10 savegames each.

!! IMPORTANT !!
Take note of how many levels the game you are selecting contains from the
select new game menu.

Games that contain 1-10 levels are Episode 1 in WOLFENSTEIN.
Games that contain 11-20 levels are Episodes 1 & 2.
21-30 levels = Episodes 1-3.
31-40 levels = Episodes 1-4
41-50 levels = Episodes 1-5
Some games have 60 levels, making all 6 Episodes active.

If you load a game that has, for example, 2 Episodes and you try to play
Episode 3, 4, 5 or 6, most likely YOUR COMPUTER WILL CRASH AND YOU WILL
HAVE TO RESET YOUR MACHINE!

The only exception to this rule is GAME CC, which contains 27 levels, but
is spread out over Episodes 1, 2, 3 & 4.  This is another good reason to
read the new game DOCs before you play the new game.

Your registered copy of Wolfenstein expects all 6 episodes to be active.
IF YOU SELECT INACTIVE EPISODES YOUR COMPUTER MAY CRASH, requiring you to
reset it.  However in no case will Wolfmaster hurt your computer or the
data stored on your hard drive(s).

The "Show CURRENT Game" command located in the Main Menu is helpful here.
If you run Wolfmaster and have forgotten which game you have loaded, you
can check with the "show current game" command.  Then, by checking in the
SELECT NEW GAME menu you will know how many Episodes are currently active.
