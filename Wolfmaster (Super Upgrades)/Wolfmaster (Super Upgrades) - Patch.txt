Patch for DOSMenu set-up for Wolf3d Super Upgrade Pack  12/17/09

If you have saved any games previously, they will always have a filetype of .WL6
They *should* be associated with the game on the menu: Game AA should have saved games
with names ending in .AA, Game C should have .C, etc. Only the plain Wolfenstein game
should have .WL6 saved games. The ability to have 10 saved games for each menu item
is what this patch restores; currently there can only be 10 saved games in total. Also,
it is now possible to load a saved game from a different set of levels than the active
game - very bad!

Before applying this patch, any saved game should be renamed to its respective map. The
filetype should match that of its parent GAMEMAPS/MAPHEAD files. If you have no idea which
game the saved game files are from, I would recommend deleting them.

If you have no saved games, merely apply the patch:

The enclosed swap.bat file should replace the current one in the WOLFREG subfolder.
Now you're ready to go!

I'm sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused.

Andy
