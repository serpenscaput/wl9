I'm sure many of you already know how to cheat in Wolf, however if you
don't know how or it doesn't work, you need to read this.

CHEATING ISN'T AS FUN!!!!

Sure, you can go into God mode, get free guns and have a big ole turkey
shoot.  You'll probably finish all 800+ levels in Wolfmaster in just a few
days.  If you purchased this package, you're probably a die-hard Wolf fan
and like to play it as it was meant to be played.  Playing the included
800+ levels without cheating will provide many more hours of entertainment.
However, sometimes cheating can be fun and it's very hard to get through
some of these new levels without it.  Then again, if it's not hard, what
fun is it?

When you select Play WOLF from the main menu, it loads WOLF with the levels
you have selected and uses the -goobers parameter that allows you to cheat
if you wish.  After you have selected which episode and skill level you
want to play, and are actually in the game and playing, you can at any time
press:

Alt-Left Shift-Backspace

all at the same time to enter DEBUG mode.  Once in debug mode, the
following keys are active:

TAB-G  God mode (Nothing hurts you)
TAB-I  Free items (Health, Ammo, Guns, Keys)
TAB-W  Warp to any level in the currently selected episode

You can also cheat without going into the debug mode by pressing the keys
MIL all at the same time.  This gives you 100% health, 99 Ammo, all guns,
both keys, and resets your score to 0.

Remember...
CHEATERS NEVER WIN, AND WINNERS NEVER CHEAT.

Problem:  I'm doing what you said, but I can't enter debug mode!

Solution:  If you carry out these instructions as directed and they don't
work, you have the new version 1.4 of WOLF3D.  Debug mode was disabled in
this version.  You need the older version 1.4 of WOLF3D.  The only way I
know to tell these two apart is to try entering debug mode.

Apogee, with great generosity, is shipping a full copy of this older
version 1.4 of WOLF with each copy of WOLFMASTER sold.  If you can't cheat
with your version of WOLF, install the version of WOLF from Apogee, then
install WOLFMASTER into the same directory.
