1 Instructions
Takes you to the Instructions menu where you can read the instructions for
WOLFMASTER.

2 Original WOLF Games
When WOLFMASTER is installed, it backs up (saves) a copy of the original
WOLFENSTEIN games that came with your copy of WOLFENSTEIN.  It also backs
up all the savegames you may have had with those original games. Choose
this selection when you want to restore and play those original
WOLFENSTEIN games.  This command is also repeated under the SELECT NEW
GAMES menu for your convenience.

3 Read new game DOCs
Many of the new game authors have something to say about their games.
Select this option to go to the new DOCs menu where you can read about the
new games.  It is highly recommended that you read these DOCs before you
play a new game.  Some authors have quite a bit to say about their games,
including mission briefings and hints.

4 SELECT NEW GAME
This option takes you to the NEW GAME menu where you can select a new game
to play.  Once a new game is selected you are ready to play the game by
selecting Play WOLF3D from the main menu.

5 Show CURRENT Game
This option displays the currently selected game.  The display will show
that, for example, GAME A or GAME BB is currently selected.  Note that GAME
APG = the original WOLF Games.  Read the INSTRUCTIONS for SELECT NEW GAME
for more about this command.

6 Play WOLF3D
This option runs WOLFENSTEIN with the selected game, or with the original
WOLFENSTEIN game if that has been restored with the Original WOLF3D Games
selection.  This option takes you directly to the main menu of WOLF3D
without having to view it's startup screens.  It also enables the -goobers
command so that you can enter the DEBUG mode if you desire. (See "How To
Cheat")

7 Exit
