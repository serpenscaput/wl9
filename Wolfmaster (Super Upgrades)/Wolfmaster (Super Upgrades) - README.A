Well, I believe it's finally finished.  Here are 17 levels I have created
myself, from scratch.  I hope you enjoy them.

These levels are hard, but not unenjoyable so.  Play on the hardest level
(I am Death Incarnate) for the most fun.  I didn't put a lot of effort into
making the game challenging if you play at any other level, but if you're
just a total wimp, you should still enjoy yourself.

Most of the secrets in these levels are clearly marked, you can hardly miss
them.  Others aren't marked at all, but they are in an area most people
would check, just because of where they are.  I hate scrubbing walls
looking for stupid little secrets, so don't bother doing it in the first
episode.  The second episode contains a few unmarked secrets, but you
shouldn't have too much trouble finding them.  Save your game just before
you enter the elevator, and if you didn't find all the secrets (and you
feel you must), you can reload the game and go back and look.

The secret elevator in Episode 2 is where you expect it to be, just look
for the marker.

If you really like these levels, please let me know.  Perhaps I'll work
on some more if I think people are enjoying them (It's a lot of work and
consumes a lot of time).
