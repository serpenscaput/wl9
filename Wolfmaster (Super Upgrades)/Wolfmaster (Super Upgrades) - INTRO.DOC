This program contains 815 new levels for Wolf3D and will allow you to
easily choose which games you want to play, without having to rename files.
To run the program, just type in WOLFM.

The different games themselves remain compressed in the file ALLGAMES.LZH.
Do not uncompress ALLGAMES.LZH.  All the games take up over 5.8 megs of
disk space, but the compressed file is under 1.4 meg.  When a new set of
games are selected to play, they are uncompressed from the LZH file and the
old games are deleted to conserve space.  All games, including your
original WOLF games, are kept safe in the compression files and are never
in danger of deletion.  Wolfmaster never leaves unnecessary files on your
hard drive, for proper operation never modify or delete any files.

I have collected these games from a number of places, and created a few
myself.  All the README files that came with these games are still included
in this package and can be read from the menu program.  Thanks to all the
people who created these games and to Id Software & Apogee for the game
itself.

Try them all, I'll admit some aren't so great, others are the BEST!
