I hope you find this program easy and pleasant to use.  Menu commands can
be selected in three different ways:

With the mouse

Using the arrow keys to move the highlight bar, then <enter>

Typing in the first letter of the desired menu selection item, then <enter>


Please read the INTRODUCTION as well as the instructions for the other
menus for a complete understanding of the program and its functions.

Several of the menus have period (.) commands in the second and third rows.
These . commands are just spacers so that the menu selections can be in
order going down, instead of across.  I think it looks better this way, and
I hope it doesn't cause too much confusion.
