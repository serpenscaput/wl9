Escape From SS Prison TC for Wolf 3D
by Ronny Zeitz (graphics and sounds) and Brian Lowe (levels/source code).

Thanks for downloading this set.  This has ten new levels (the first episode), and 
a lot of new graphics and sounds. The remaining five episodes have levels from my 
first WolfBel set.

The set is fairly difficult, but not impossible to beat. There are a few keys in 
hidden rooms, and a few tricks here and there but the style  is otherwise fairly 
similar to that used in the original Wolfenstein 3D set. There are many new walls 
and objects, and I hope you will find the new sounds particularly effective. Many 
thanks to Ronny for providing these.

Source code changes in this set include ceiling colours, episode names and increased 
ammo/health allowances. 

This set is available from my main web site at http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~brlowe. 
It is listed as 'Stand Alone' levels in the registered levels section. There are 
also more than five hundred other sets available, including many for 'Spear Of Destiny'.
