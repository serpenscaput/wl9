          *YOU MUST HAVE THE FULL VERSION OF WOLFENSTEIN TO PLAY THIS SET*  
             
                   Mutantstein V - Gottspear

   IT IS 3 DAYS SINCE YOU ESCAPED THE HELLHOLE CASTLE GOTTENHEIMER.
 YOU ARE SITTING IN A DUSSELDORF PUB SIPPING SOME 
OF THE FINEST SCHNAPPS YOU HAVE EVER TASTED.
 OUT OF THE CORNER OF THE ROOM COMES AN ARGUMENT FROM A COUPLE OF FARMERS
TALKING ABOUT A PAIR OF DEAD NAZI GUARDS THEY FOUND
 ON THEIR FARM LOCATED TO THE EAST NEAR THE OLD ABANDONED CASTLE GOTTSPEAR.
BUTTING INTO THE CONVERSATION, YOU DISCOVER THAT THERE HAS BEEN
 SOME STRANGE ACTIVITIES GOING ON AROUND THE OLD CASTLE. LOCATED 
IN A DRY LAKE BED, THE CASTLE WAS FLOODED FOR YEARS AND NO-ONE EVER WENT THERE.
 IT SEEMS IN RECENT MONTHS, SEVERAL BODIES HAVE
TURNED UP IN THE AREA, SO MUTILATED AS TO BE UNRECOGNIZABLE.
 THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE BODIES WERE NAZI GUARDS SPARKS YOUR INTEREST 
AND YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE......JUST WHAT YOU NEED, RIGHT?
 ANOTHER DAMP, LEAKY, DRAFTY OLD CASTLE FULL OF MURDERING NAZI SCUM...
GO NOW AND DISCOVER WHATS BEEN DOING THE KILLING.
LEADING TO A CONFRONTATION WITH THE FACE OF ULTIMATE EVIL....
     The above was taken from the readme file included in John's original set "Gottspear".

It was John's first set to include graphics changes. I decided that the levels were 
of great design and that the set could benefit from some better graphics and the 
addition of more levels and an upgrade to the full version to take advantage of some 
source code work. The theme of the original set fits perfectly into the Mutantstein 
series, so here we are: Gottspear:2nd Edition. Here are some new levels of Mutant 
filled carnage, including Harry Mass's famous "Brown Boys" and of course, John's 
great sound effects....lol...Harry Mass has also loaned his fabulous editing skills, 
as I am still a "NEWBY".(ha ha) at doing Wolf sets...There is also some new music 
and a few other changes that add to the atmosphere...Lots of puzzles and traps also 
abound so you can bet that the gameplay is never boring. That name of the game here 
is shoot, run like hell, and shoot some more. There is ammo lying around, but you 
will need to pick up a lot too when you toast'em.
The original 6 levels are still here, but not in their original places, so jump in, 
blow up some Nazi scum and have a real "Party" with the "boys". There are UBERMUTANTS, 
a TRANSGROSSE or 2 and of course, THE ANGEL OF DEATH is in residence somewhere in 
the castle. Have a great visit and I'll see you on "The Other Side"...........Bobby
