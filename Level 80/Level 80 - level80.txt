Thank you for wanting to play Level 80.

In order to play Level 80 you need to own a registered version of Spear of Destiny 
by ID Software. Copy the AUDIOHED and AUDIOT files from Spear of Destiny to Level 
80 and change the extensions accordingly:

audiot.l80


Level 80 consists of one special level
The "Death Incarnate" difficulty level is designed to be as difficult as possible 
without being impossible!
It is possible to get the 100% ratio in all three categories.
Level 80 has been tested and won on "Death Incarnate" with total ratios of 100% in 
all three categories.

Remember to leave saved games in different slots so that you may go back to different 
stages of the level you are on if you need to.
