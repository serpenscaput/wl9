    FOR THE REGISTERED GAME ONLY!!!!

    Here are 6 episodes, 60 levels of Wolfenstien, at its best-or
my best.  Tired of collecting crowns and raising your score?
The 60 levels (games 1,2,3,4,5,&6) are packed with bad guys, ammo,first
aid, and powerups!  It's "run n' gun" in the castle. The 9th 
floor is NOT the end, that's the 10th floor.

    Some of the floors seem impossible, but I can beat 'em
without cheating OR saving- of course, I know where all the good stuff
is! You might have to play in GOD MODE for a while, to see what's what.

  To install:
 1. unzip the file into your Wolf directory.
 2. execute NEW_IN.COM   This changes the extension
    of Gamemaps and Maphead from .wl6 to .old

                     Thats it!

 To restore YOUR old game, run NEW_OUT.COM

If anyone wants a map of any of my levels, my e-mail address is;

Happy killin'   Tony
