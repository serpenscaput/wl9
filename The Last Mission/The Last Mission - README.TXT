Welcome to The Last Mission!

TLM is a map-pack for Wolfenstein 3D. It features no new graphics, sounds or
source code changes, except the VGAGRAPH title screen change. It was my
intention to create a pack of high quality maps for Wolfenstein 3D, without
worrying about source code and graphics. I think I achieved my goal; I
created ten big, hard and detailed levels, all with different gameplay style
and level of complication.

Before you start, you must know that those levels are not easy. There are
lots of guards, tricks and stuff that will make you think. You may not
enjoy all of the levels because of that, but I'm sure you'll like some of
them. Remember - don't play all ten levels in a row, because you'll get
bored very fast. Play them when you feel tempted for the challenge.

I must tell you that I didn't add many secret rooms. On some maps, there
are even only two of them. I think I placed so much food & first aid kits
that there isn't any "additional", secret help needed - so you'll mainly
find treasure and/or guns.

There are ten levels in this mappack. No additional Wolfenstein files are
needed.

Suggested PAR times:

Level 1                 2:00
Level 2                 3:30
Level 3                 3:00
Level 4                 4:00
Level 5                 4:00
Level 6                 3:00
Level 7                 4:30
Level 8                 3:30
Level 9                 -:--
Level 10                -:--
