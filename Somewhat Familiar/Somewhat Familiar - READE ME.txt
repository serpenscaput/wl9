=+= SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR =+=

Greetings player! Thank you for downloading and playing my fifth release, Somewhat Familiar!
This is just a mapset with the good, old vanilla graphics. No new fancy additions this time...I think...
This mapset spans 5 floors, 3 regular, 1 boss, and 1 secret, with each floor balanced for a pistol start.
This can be played on any Wolf3D port, be it DOS, SDL, or EC & LZWolf.
Just drag and drop a Wolf3D exe with no coding changes and other necessary files, and you're ready to roll!

This mod was made using the following utilities:
* WDC = for making maps

Thank you again for downloading this mod! Happy Wolfing!
