Ipank7000's Mapset                                        13 July 2011


Here's a new mapset by Ipank7000, 60 new levels.Feel free to use them as your own 
project
but please give me credit if you use them. You need your own registered 
wolf3d audio and vswap to play this mapset.

Because i wanted to make this as "pure Wolf3d" as possible, there have
been minimal changes to the EXE. ceiling color changes, 
and par times have been altered.

Thanks to:

  id Software for releasing the Wolf3d source code
  Ripper for creating the Wolf4SDL engine to play Wolf3d in Windows
  Brian Lowe for hosting this at the Wolf3d Dome
  My brother for give me ideas
  My father for buy full version of wolf3d

Enough reading...start playing!
