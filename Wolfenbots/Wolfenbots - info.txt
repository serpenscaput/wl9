WolfenBots - 880.1KB - 30th December 2004 (alpha 3) (but it doesn't work)
By -TexZK


Mod cancelled: it contains too many errors (damned 16bit DOS grr...) 

Anyway, it's a bot-based Total Conversion of Wolf3D... when it was still working, 
you were able to fight against intelligent BOTs, like in Free-For-All games. 

Due to programming errors, the mod was cancelled. I had many problems with the DOS 
16bit architecture, like leaked memory (expecially for sounds) and far memory textures. 


I'm sorry... but I'm moving on 32bit Windows OpenGL programming...
