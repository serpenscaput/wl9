Story:
*****************************************************************************
  Despite Adolf Hitler's downfall, several groups of surviving Nazis refused
to give in and so started mini-wars of their own.  Many are worried because,
rumours are, a revolutionary new crystal has been discovered, called the
Omega Crystal. If refined correctly, it provides virtually limitless energy,
but also provides massive explosive power - and the Nazis intend to use it
for its second use!!!

  The Grosse and Giftmacher family are known to be involved.  However, the
supreme leader is believed to be Martin Bormann, Hitler's fixer.  But he
commited suicide, didn't he?  Or did he somehow cheat death?

TIP:
  Some of the descriptions deliberately give away some of the levels'
  content - read on for more secret intelligence!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 1.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Though Hitler is dead, the Third Reich may not have collapsed as originally
  thought.  Intelligence claims that a large detachment of Nazis have taken
  refuge inside a number of fortresses and are believed to be researching
  forbidden technologies to start a World War III that the Allies have no
  chance of winning.  Whatever is happening must be stopped at all costs.
 
Level 1 - Security HQ

        You jump off the back of a truck into the fortress's security
        control centre.  Take out any resistance and find your way to
        the next floor.

Level 2 - Hitlers' Court

        The hidden and spectacular mediaeval-like banquet courts; a Hitler
        family heirloom.  Swastika banners hang from the ceiling in the great
        corridor.  Find the key into the main banquet hall where a feast is
        already underway with the Officers, Guards and the SS.

        TIP: Don't run into the kitchen unprepared - the officer chefs can
        shoot better than they can cook!

Level 3 - The Basement

        A rather sadistic floor in the fortress - a small army barracks right
        next to a prison full of rotting skeletons.  Find your way out of
        here before you have too many nightmares.

Level 4 - Engineering Bay

        A little bit empty at the moment; the vastness of the rooms used to
        be filled to the ceiling with Gatling Guns, Panzerfausts (Rocket
        Launchers), Mortars and everything else that they used during WWII.
        Thankfully, this engineering bay was shut down several months ago,
        but that doesn't mean that it is unoccupied.

Level 5 - Tactical Ops

        This is where Officers plot their next move and hide their inventory.
        Scour the corridors and passageways, eliminating every threat and
        acquiring anything that could be of use.

Level 6 - Parade Square

        Make your way to the elevator in a nearby structure.  Try to avoid
        attracting the attention of the parade squads, or your position
        could be overrun.

Level 7 - Command Centre

        Penetrate the Command Centre of this sector.  Careful, many direct
        routes are blocked and require access though some other means.

Level 8 - Espionage

        Behold, the gardens of the fortress at midnight!  The thick foliage
        obscures your vision, the rock faces form a virtual hedge maze, and
        the guard dogs that patrol the grounds will not hesistate at
        ambushing you!  What must you do?  Find the entrance to the secret
        offices.

Level 9 - Top Secret!

        Finally, the top secret offices; unfortunately, security does not
        stop here!  Three guardians shepherd the doors of the archive rooms
        and the Top Secret documents of Martin Bormann's whereabouts and his
        plans for the Omega Crystals, "Project: Omega".  Good luck.

 Secret - Covert Ops

        Things cannot get any more secret than this.  Though leaving this
        underground research facility is easy enough, will curiosity tempt
        you to enter its portals into the unknown world of "Project: Omega"?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 2.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  With a map of the Nazi fortresses and the plans for the Omega Crystals, you
  are parachuted into the specified compound...

Level 1 - Perimeter

        Locate the Jewelled-Bronze Key to open the door to the entrance of
        the castle.  Try not to take too much damage.

Level 2 - Entrance Hall

        You're inside the castle, but the elevator that leads to the upper
        floor has a safety lock on it.  Locate its silver key.

Level 3 - Corridor

        Deeper inside!  A massive corridor is split into several segments,
        but you can't get cross the segments directly, work your way through
        the corridor - the long way!

Level 4 - Officers' Mess

        Assassinate the Officers that give this floor its name.  Only then
        will the armies fall apart.

Level 5 - Treasury

        Kill the three Guardians that hang on to the keys; then, if you wish
        raid the treasuries!

Level 6 - Hot Pursuit

        This cave is a navigation training site and shooting range for
        Officers and SS's. Can you get to the exit elevator before the Çlite
        warriors make you target practice?  What a headache!

Level 7 - Amazing!

        The exit is straight in front of you, but is blockaded.  Work your
        way through the maze of corridors to get to it from behind.  This
        floor, however, has another reason why it's called 'Amazing!'

Level 8 - Gatekeepers

        The elevator stops one floor short of the mines.  More elevators lie
        nearby that WILL lead to the mines, but they require three keys to
        activate, which are held by three guardians.  Will the shortage of
        ammo hold back a hero like yourself?

Level 9 - The Omega Mines

        At last!  The mines!  Dozens of raw Omega Crystals jut out from all
        over the place.  The steel mining machines are scattered around
        everywhere, drilling holes through the mine walls, digging for Omega
        Crystals.  The Remnants of the Third Reich would usually use the
        freight lift to get down here, but that's in another part of the
        mines behind sealed doors.  Kill the guardian that wields the key to
        the main mining area, and then locate Martin Bormann who is believed
        to be overseeing the mining process.  He, the organiser of this
        outrage, must be eliminated.

        TIP:

        If you do happen to find the freight lift (it has a long wall of
        rails, and is filled with drums of refined Omega Crystal and two of
        the mining machines) you will be rewarded!

 Secret - Madness!

        If you happen to find this level, collect as much as you can before
        the SSs and the 'unexpected strangers' get rid of you!

        TIP:

        There is a giveaway pattern in which doors can and cannot be opened
        by the gold key. You just have to be (very) observant.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 3.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  With Martin Bormann assassinated, the remnants of the Third Reich are
scattered in disarray... except... one last group, who withhold tonnes of
Omega Crystal, and have a Omega Refinery somewhere in their compound.  Plus,
they are now experimenting with their eternal power.  Combined with Schabbs's
research and technology, they have already worked out how to make mutants and
summon Hitler Ghosts with it - be warned, they have also created three
UberMutants; and their numbers may increase quickly.  Stop them before it is
too late!

Level 1 - Vehicle Depot

        This is where the Omega Crystals are transported.  Kill the Officers
        and SSs located in this area.

Level 2 - Steel Temple

        This is the nickname for a security system built around a maze of
        steel passages and doors, and well-hidden keys.

Level 3 - Prison Complex

        Many unfortunate prisoners-of-war were transported here to be
        transformed into mutants.  No mutants lurk around here, however;
        they have already been moved to the laboratories elsewhere.
        Nevertheless, getting through will be a challenge, especially with
        a Guardian holding the Gold Key to the exit.

Level 4 - Armoury

        This dark and gloomy floor holds ammunition and guns for mutants to
        have attached to their chests.  Be warned, a number of prepared
        mutants guard the armoury, and the first UberMutant!!!

Level 5 - Barracks

        Because of the secrecy of the Omega Crystals and their refining, many
        of the workers and guards have to actually live in the fortress.
        Expect heavy resistance!

Level 6 - The Warehouse

        This is the fortress's storage facility and treasury.  It is now
        almost empty.  Just be careful - the route out of the storage complex
        is locked and the necessary keys are hidden in the store rooms.
        Note, most of the treasure and tools that used to be stored here has
        already been spent or stored elsewhere, leaving an empty, dark and
        rather spooky maze of rooms and access tunnels, but some small
        stockpiles and loose items still remain.

Level 7 - Omega Refinery

        This is the place where the Raw Omega Crystals are refined down to
        their hyper-explosive state.  Mutants are everywhere, but the biggest
        risk is when you have to shut down the kiln - the shut-off switch is
        actually IN the kiln and someone has taken away the fireproof suit!
        Therefore, you will have to enter it while it is red-hot.

Level 8 - Laboratories

        This is the heart of the Omega Crystal experimentation. Guards are
        everywhere, determined not to let you into the main laboratory (where
        their latest creations await, including the second UberMutant), OR
        onto the next floor where their GREATEST creation awaits, greater
        than anything so far...

Level 9 - Project: Omega

        Well, you made it onto the next floor, but their 'greatest' creation
        was not at all what you expected.  It is a massive 'super-bomb'.
        Packed with several tonnes of refined Omega Crystals, it has enough
        explosive power to destroy the whole of Europe - and it is making
        very unusual sounds!  The few remaining Nazis and mutants are so
        determined to see the continent perish that they are willing to make
        the ULTIMATE sacrifice... to destroy their country to destroy Europe!

        Locate and disarm the bomb before its timer reaches zero.

        TIP 1:

          You may find a few scattered mutants and 'creations' along the
          way... and... if you're unlucky... the final UberMutant!  If you do
          locate and kill the UberMutant however, all the doors in the maze
          will be unlocked, making it much easier to get through.

        TIP 2:

          Take advantage of Mutants opening locked doors for you by killing
          them while they are still in the doorway; it could considerably
          shorten the route to the bomb for you.

        We salute you... well, we will if we still exist after you go in!

Secret - "Undeadly!"

        The name says it all.  This level has mutants!  There is plenty of
        reward if you find this level, but you have to locate the Jewelled
        Bronze Key and take the gold and silver keys away from the two
        Guardians which appear somewhere in this secret treasury.

        TIP:

        Acquiring the keys is difficult, especially on the highest difficulty
        rating, "I am Death Incarnate", but a secret room, not too deep into
        the complex, does contain copies of all three keys.

*****************************************************************************
Enemies:
*****************************************************************************
        Guard (Brown Soldier)
                Simple soldier.  Slow firing, slow moving and slow drawing;
                but he can pack a punch if you're caught off-guard.

                Worth 100 points

        Guard Dog
                Weak, but fast and good at avoiding your shots.  For these
                German Shepherds, their bite is worse than their bark!

                Worth 200 points

        Officer (White Soldier)
                Very fast moving, good at strafing and a very quick draw!

                Worth 400 points

        SS (Blue Soldier)
                A Nazi êlite troop!  These nasties can take a hell of a lot
                of punishment, thanks to their bullet-proof armour, and are
                armed with rapid-fire machine guns.  The only good point
                worth noting about these guys?  They drop their machine guns
                when killed.

                Worth 500 points

        Mutant (Green Soldier)
                Slow, but doesn't have to draw its gun, because it is already
                drawn - connected to its chest - and it is very rapid firing;
                worse still, it moves silently, so you won't know if its seen
                or heard you.

                Worth 700 points

        Hitler Ghost
                Mysterious entities that love to pump fast-moving fireballs
                into your face!

                Worth 2,000 points

        Blue Guardian (Hans Grosse relative)
                Well armoured, equipped with a pair of particularly nasty
                Gatling Guns!  Drops the gold key when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        Red Guardian (Gretel Grosse relative)
                Similar to the Blue Guardian, but she prefers two large
                shotguns instead of two chainguns.  Yet they do pack a punch,
                even at long range.  She drops the silver key when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        White Guardian (Otto Giftmacher relative)
                Large guy with a Panzerfaust (rocket launcher) - Enough said!
                Drops the jewelled bronze key when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        Ubermutant (Large Green Guardian with four arms and chest chaingun!)
                What gets most people is its terrifying appearance - then,
                once it catches you off-guard, it minces you with its chest
                chaingun! Drops the jewelled bronze key when killed.

                Worth 10,000 points

        Martin Bormann
                The boss at the end of Episode 2.  Following the footsteps of
                his predecessor by doning full body-armour with enough
                weaponry to make a hole in the earth, this black nightmare
                is sure to make a pool of blood out of you!

                Worth 10,000 points

*****************************************************************************
Locked Doors:
*****************************************************************************
       Locked doors are silver, steel-plated reinforced doors with a keyhole
       in the centre.  You require a key (which is located elsewhere in the
       same level) to open it.  Guards, however, can open these doors at
       anytime.  If you are skilled enough, kill a guard while he is in
       the doorway, and the door will be jammed open.  Bingo!  You got
       through without the key!

       NOTE:
         Guards can also open the locked door which cannot be opened by any
       of the three keys.  One particular level uses this trick and, if you
       pull it off, you are rewarded with tonnes of treasure and 1UPs!  Also
       note, Dogs and Hitler Ghosts cannot open doors.

*****************************************************************************
Mechanical Doors:
*****************************************************************************
       A mechanical door is nothing more than a plain steel plate with no
       handle or lock on it.  To open them, you must locate a switch with its
       handle in the "up" position (the switch in the entry elevator doesn't
       count!)  Some doors start initially open and others initially closed.
       Flipping the switch will toggle these doors so the ones that were
       closed are now open and vice versa.  Note that neither the player nor
       enemies can open or close these doors in any other way.

*****************************************************************************
"End of Level" Bonuses:
*****************************************************************************
       TIP:  If you prove yourself superior and scour the floors undefeated,
             you may be rewarded the secret bonus!

       At the end of a level, you may be rewarded extra bonus points:
       You get 25,000 points for finding and completing the secret level, but

*****************************************************************************
Tips:
*****************************************************************************

-      To find secrets, hold SPACE (or whatever you have the "Open" command
       set to) and run down against a wall, facing it.  This technique will
       not open doors but it will open secret pushback walls.

-      Try not to pick up unused ammunition clips (not dropped by soldiers)
       if you have 95 bullets or more, as you will waste the full 8.  Collect
       it when your bullet count is lower.

_      Running allows you to get out of danger quickly; use it whenever you
       can, because you might beat the par time as well.

-      ALWAYS run in E3L9!  You can cover more ground in less time.

-      Use the knife if possible to kill lone guards.  Every bullet counts.

-      Do not use the knife against Mutants.

-      1UPs give you 25 bullets and heal you back to full health; do not
       waste them; extra lives are worthless during the immediate future.

-      Shooting might attract the attention of guards and dogs nearby.  Using
       the knife does not do this until you injure or kill an enemy.

-      If you run low on ammunition, try to get away to find more ammunition,
       especially if you are fighting a Guardian.

-      Bullets, both yours and enemies', do more damage at closer range.

-      Learn how to strafe (side-step).  Use it to hide behind walls while
       fighting Guardians, so you can keep facing them, and to avoid the
       White Guardians' (Otto Giftmacher) and Martin Bormann's rockets and
       the Hitler Ghosts' fireballs.

-      Do not be fooled by a false sense of security.  If you open a door to
       a room that appears empty, check who is lurking to the side of the
       door, just out of view!  Too many times have cocky amateur players
       rushed straight in and got shot in the back.

-      Do not assume that all of the enemies are in front of your gun's
       barrels.  Periodically check if a guard has not sneaked up behind you.

-      Some, but not all, obstacles can block rockets and fireballs, but not
       bullets.  Use them for cover.

-      Do not assume that the exit lies behind an elevator door.  It might be
       a booby-trap.

-      If you cannot find a key for a locked door, it might be wielded by a
       Guardian.  However, if the only key for a locked door is hidden behind
       a pushwall, it is not usually required to complete the level with
       (None of the "Project: Omega" levels require them)

-      If, when pressing a wall, you hear a sound similar to when pressing on
       a locked door without the matching key, it is a pushback wall that is
       blocked from behind or cannot move in that particular direction.  Try
       pressing it from another angle.

-      Do not always use the Gatling Gun - it consumes ammo like popcorn.
       The machine gun, pistol or even the knife in some cases can be better
       weapons to use against weak enemies like guard dogs.

-      Watch where patrolling guards march; you never know, they might lead
       you somewhere worth noting.

-      Take advantage if a guard opens a locked door that you do not yet have
       the key for.  Shoot the guard in the doorway so it is jammed open.

-      Be careful of dogs and guards.  Though they are weak, they can act as
       cover for more powerful enemies, such as SSs, behind them.

-      Martin Bormann is a ruthless murderer who will merrily mow down his
       own men if they get in the way of his firepower.  Take this to your
       advantage.

            Mechanical doors that are toggled by a switch.

            Jewelled Bronze Key (A third key)

            Ubermutant from S.o.D. with slight AI modification (Drops
              Jewelled Bronze Key and is more agressive and unpredictable)

            Countdown Timer on very last level (E3L9)

            New Bonuses at end of Level/Episode.  Discover how to claim the
            secret bonus yourself!

            New Nazi banner that disintegrates slowly when shot

	    New Explosive Barrel that can take several enemies out at once if
	      shot.

            Tile 0xca is now an invisible wall that is totally transparent,
              yet blocking to actors and the player.  These are generally
              used for effect in level transitions (i.e. between levels 8 and
              9 of Episode 1)

        Modifications to already existing features:
        -------------------------------------------
            Secret Doors (Pushback walls) now ALWAYS move back 2 spaces.
              They occasionally moved 3 spaces due to a bug in a mathematical
              expression.

            Elevator "Back Maps" have been changed.

            Otto Giftmacher now drops a Jewelled-bronze key

            Gretel Grosse now drops a silver key

	    Dr. Schabbs art & code replaced with that of the UberMutant.

            General Fettgeschist art & code replaced with that of the Death
            Knight.

	    UberMutant and Death Knight sounds added.

	    Martin Bormann's (Death Knight) rockets produce a powerful
	      splash-damage explosion, as do the White Guardian's rockets on
	      "I am Death Incarnate" mode.

	    "ENDGAME" Floor-code trigger adapted so it ends the level with an
	    open door sound (because they are placed in front of doors, to
	    give the impression of the player opening it to go into the next
            sector) rather than ending the episode.  Note that it only works
            for levels 1-8, and level 10.  Walking over an "ENDGAME" on level
            9 will end the episode as it does normally.

        Other Miscellaneous Changes:
        ----------------------------
            Much new art (wall textures, door textures and sprite textures)

            "Robert's Jukebox" now accessible from Main Menu.

            Menu Color Scheme changed

            Intro, menu and level music changed.

            Ceiling Colours have been changed.

            Floor Colour has been changed for E1L8.
