Eight weeks ago, Allied intelligence recieved reports of suspicious activity at an old
lead mine in northern Germany. German rail activity and captured personnel reports
indicated that recovered Wermacht casualties were all being diverted to a single facility located on Rammelsberg
mountain. More disturbingly, spies in the German civil administration reported that graveyards and mortuaries were being
ransacked by armed gestapo agents, with no explanation as to what they were doing with the bodies...

The horrifying answer came only scant days later as Athens, so recently liberated
by the Allies was overrun by grey-skinned soliders. Following the expulsion of 
Allied forces, no reports were forthcoming from the city and subsequent inquiry
reveals that the civilian population had been all but exterminated. Even worse, 
aerial reconnaissance showed trains leaving the dead city bound for the same facility.

Further investigation revealed the ambitions of SS-Oberscharfuhrer Doctor 
Ralf Krebsmeister. Another pretender to the legacy of Dr. Schabbs, Krebsmeister
gained the favor of Hitler and was given a special dispensation to resume and improve
on the work of his idol and given a blank check on raw materials and slave labor 
needed to make this possible.

Kreb's main center of operations in located in Rugensberg castle in upper Saxony.
Recent renovations have undertaken to connect the castle to the myriad abandoned mineshafts cut through the 
mountain below. Most of the production of undead soldiers takes place here to prevent containment breach
but adiministrative tasks and advanced research takes place in the fortress above.

Your mission is to infiltrate the facility, assassinate Krebsmeister and plant 
explosive charges along the foundation of the castle. This will bury the mutant production
facility and eliminate any possibility of another hopeful resuming Schabbs diabolical work. 
Captain William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, you've got a gun and five floors of hell 
ahead of you. Good luck!
