WOLFPAK v1.0
creator - AstroCreep (Sam Feichter)

This is a compilation of all the maps I did from the years
of 1996-2006.  I have cleaned up some of the shittier maps
and compiled the best walls from each of the mapsets to
make one decent one.  These maps range in quality from
decent to total shitsauce, however some were back from when
I was about 8 years old.  I'm gonna ride that excuse for 
as long as possible lol.  Thank you for downloading and
please enjoy.

TOTAL = 48 Maps
