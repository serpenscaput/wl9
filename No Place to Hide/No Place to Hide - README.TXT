        This Version of Wolfenstein was edit with wolfedit and mapedit.
        Some of the graphics are from other edited games and some of
        the floor layout are new. This, **** No Place to Hide **** is for
        people who know how to play Wolfenstein 3D. Good Luck, Ha Ha.
        If you are new to Wolfenstein 3D, then this is very hard on the 
        highest level. These levels are set to see how well you play, 
        and remember. . .

        These levels are the best I could put together to make a fun
        Wolfenstein, shoot 'em up game I could make. I max out all I
        could do for the game. O, by the way guys, who's the big guy?
        And remember every shot counts. So go get'em if you can. Run
        for your life, yes "Run and keep running!" Bang! Bang! BANG!
        Duck! Look out behind you! That was a close one. Good shooting!
        And this version can be won without cheating. Look for other
        Wolfenstein games. . .
