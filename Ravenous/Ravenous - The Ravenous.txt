What's happening...

========================================================-----

As you stand patroling outside of the CPF Corperation Military Base to smoke with 
your friends, you can see the sun slowly 
rise.

Jake, one of your friends, is talking to your other friend about how he single-handedly 
killed 6 terrorists with just a
pocket knife and went on to disable their bomb. But before he can say, "Stop laughing, 
I'm serious!" a scream is heard by
your team from the inside of the base. The three of you run in, just for the door 
to malfunction behind you and snap shut
leaving no visible way to exit the facilty. 

You look toward the check-in counter, just to find the person who would be kind and 
open doors for you dead on the ground
with an unreasonable ammount of flesh missing from their body. You run up to see 
what happened, only to see a gory mess
spread among the entire desk. You pull out your gun and turn to your mates, who are 
dead. You wonder, what could be so
quiet to not even alarm a trained special tactics security soldier, yet be so fast 
to get in, kill fast enough to make sure
neither of the poor bastards could fire, yet also be able to leave so quickly. Whoever 
is doing this is a real sick person,
but they know alot about what they're doing. But you have that training and a good 
gun, and no matter how fast or silent you
are, a bullet between your eyes will kill you...

...right?

The ravenous...

=====================================================================-----------------------------


This is the only information you have gathered of the creatures you will find:

Whiptail: A bee-like creature pumped full of helium that lives basically to die. 
It will weaken an enemy as much as possible
	by stabbing them with the whip-like organism hanging from its bottom, which is where 
the name comes from. Whenever
	the enemy is too weak to fight, the organism will exit the whiptail and enter the 
enemy and control them to turn
	them into mutations. Without the tail, a whiptail will slowly die and disolve into 
the nest.

The Lost: The first phase of mutation that happens to a human after being whipped. 
They are not very mutated, but there is
	visible damage to their physical and mental state. Their hand has started to deform 
over their selected weapon.

Enforcer: Once a Lost is controlled too long by the manipulating organism, they will 
start to further deform and loose all
	reasonable thought. They all seem to be holding on to SMGs and take a fair ammount 
of punishment.

Ravanger: The third step of mutation, the Ravanger hardly seems human any more. They 
are swift and very brutal, but die much
	faster than the Enforcer. They appear to hold a type of gun that you cannot equip 
that shoots bullets that have been
	heated to a molten-metal stage.

Guardian: When any mutation suddenly hits a large supply of energy, they will rapidly 
mutate to a further stage that should
	take many years to reach. A guardian has been equipped with a heavy chaingun that 
makes raw hamburger out of idiots
	that should take no caution around him. Takes an insane ammount of damage to dent.


Baetal: The Lost aren't the only ones that can mutate. When a Whiptail gets a dose 
of extreme heat or fire then a large
	bubble appears in the side of the whiptail and the organism on the bottom will die, 
but it will still support the
	whiptail's life, but it mutates into a tube that will convert the heat from the 
boil into flaming grease that will
	across the floor. At this stage the whiptail becomes known as a Baetal. The heat 
also toughens Baetal's skin, so it
	takes more bullets to bring down.

The Nest: The nest is an enormous living organism that absorbs everything slowly. 
One has somehow started life inside of your
	military base, and it decided it won't leave. The mass ammounts of power generators 
inside of facility provide the
	nest with life. The nest also seems to be the only environment in which Whiptails 
can be born.

Queen: A queen, though rare and menacing, are actually quite common amung the aliens, 
though there appears to be only one
	inside of the facility, so don't even try to think about what more than one can 
do. They contain so much compressed
	energy that they explode upon their death.
