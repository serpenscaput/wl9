Here are 21 new floors for Spear of Destiny. There are new graphics for the game 
now, thanks to me. 

You were sent by the President to a secret castle recently discovered by allied spies. 
Your job is to seek out and recover the Spear of Destiny.
Not only does this castle hold the Spear of Destiny it is where all the toxic chemicals 
are being shipped. So be careful, and good luck. 




I wish to thank all the people that made and helped make Spear of Destiny.
If it wasn't for them you would not be able to play my new levels.
