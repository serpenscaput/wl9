Okay, here it is again, the one and only, the GUYSTEIN.
My interest in Wolfenstein 3D isn't gone and by that reason I have
made the last months some new levels for my favorite game.
You now have the result in your hands.
I'm afraid this is the final Wolfenstein set I have made.
Though, I'm planning to make my two sets (I and II) better by adding
new sounds and graphics, but this will not be for the near future.
Despite this all, I hope you like this set.

There is one adjustement in GUYSTEIN, THE SECOND, namely
 ! No 149 guards in every round, 'only' 144 in every round (I have done
 ! this to prevent the abnormal breakdown from the program with the message
 ! 'Out of Memory'.  But it seems not to work properly.)
But don't panic, the levels still are very exhausting and challenging.

In GUYSTEIN, THE SECOND is level 1 and 3 and 5 playable (you still need the 
registered version of Wolfenstein, but who hasn't?).
Unzip the zip file 'Guystsec.zip' into your Wolfenstein directory (please
rename first the original 'Gamemaps.wl6' and 'Maphead.wl6' into files
with extension '*.old'.
The other important file, namely 'Vswap.wl6' you will find in the original
GUYSTEIN zip file (this is 'Guystein.zip').
For level 2 and 4 and 6 (called 'The Four Towers' (2) and 'Spider Arms' 
(4) and 'Back To The Past' (6), included in the file 'Guystse2.zip') 
you need a code (see a little bit further).
Open this zip file, put the code into Winzip-Options-Passwords and unzip
the whole thing.
Now you can play the entire 60 levels.

I have received a lot of mail to get the code for GUYSTEIN and I
thank everybody for it.
Because I like the idea of Passwords in Zip files I gonna do this here again.
The code (for playing level 2) is a number of 12 digits, like 121704100126.
Now is this code not the right one, but it is easy to give an explanation
with this example.
The real code is that one that you get when you count all the secret
doors from every round 8 in the original GUYSTEIN and put them in the code.
So means the code above that
 * level 1-8 has 12 secret doors
 * level 2-8 has 17 secret doors
 * level 3-8 has 04 secret doors
 * level 4-8 has 10 secret doors
 * level 5-8 has 01 secret doors (that's not much)
 * level 6-8 has 26 secret doors
There are many ways to find this code
 * If you have the full version of GUYSTEIN (in other words the code 
   for GUYSTEIN) and Mapedit, you easily can see it in the statistics screen.
 * If you have the full version of GUYSTEIN, you can play it again and simply
   count the secret rooms (you can also Warp some levels).
 * You can simply mail me and ask the code.  I will give it without any 
   problem.

Oh, ya, another thing.
Maybe the secret floor of level 6 is a bit too difficult.
But it is possible!
How?
Or you find it out yourself, or I can tell it here.
Because the last one is a bit stupid, I suggest the following.
If you really do not know how to end that level (if you ever find the
secret door that permits you the entry to it), you can mail me and
simply ask a solution (because there are two, the easy one and the
hard one).


So this is it, hopefully you enjoy the whole thing.

If you want to contact me, mail me or put something on my guestbook.


IMPORTANT!: DON'T COMPLAIN TO APOGEE IF YOU EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH
                THIS FREEWARE.  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, MAIL TO ME (PLEASE
                NOT TO OFTEN).  I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR COMPUTER START
                TO CRASH OR TO DO THINGS YOU DON'T ASK HIM TO DO!



Thanks to everybody who likes this add-on.

Thanks for playing Guystein, The Second!
