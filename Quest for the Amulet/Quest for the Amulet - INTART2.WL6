^C7d THE STORY

^C00 It seems that the Afrika Korps led by Major Wustenwolf have already gone to 
Egypt. But you've just found a Nazi airplane. As you got into the plane, you started 
its motor to fly away. You headed straight for Egypt. As you got there, you parachuted 
from the plane and landed in a German military base. This must be where Major Wustenwolf 
is!
