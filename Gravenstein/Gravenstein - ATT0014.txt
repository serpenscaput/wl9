GRAVENSTEIN (Four new levels for the registered version 
of Wolfenstein 3D)

The Story: You were walking down an old German road 
one day and you saw a house next to a graveyard.  You 
thought it might be a good place to hold 
up for the night. 

Then you find out that it's a Nazi outpost!  The only 
choice is to load your revolver, and go to it...

Gravenstein includes:
-Four action packed levels
-An E-MAIL help line
-And a surprise Deathmatch.

Note: This game was originally meant to have 
only one level.  To get to the other 3, you'll have 
to get past the Boss on level one but not kill him. 

The helpline is on doom (at) idmail.com
