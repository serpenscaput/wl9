Castlestein.txt

Castlestein.ZIP is a 10 level set which is an add-on for Wolfenstein 3-D shareware version 1.4.

The original levels were made by Daniel Patterson for the PC, but I have modified them slightly so that they work OK on Acorn/Archimedes machines.

There's little difference between this version and the one for the PC.  A few of the levels, notably 3 and 4 are slightly smaller.

Enjoy.
