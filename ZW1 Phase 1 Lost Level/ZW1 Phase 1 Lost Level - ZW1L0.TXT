Frequently Asked Questions

Who are you?

I'm a Dutch male, 17 years old.

What is ZW1 Lost Level 0 ?

It's an unfinished level that never made and
will never make it to the completed phases
of ZW1. I'ts only released for curiosity.

How do i install the level?

1. Install a fresh copy in a new directory of Wolfenstein 3-D Full Version.
2. Get and install MapEdit for DOS (last version) from http://www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk
   in the new directory and unpack the WOLF.ZIP file in the same directory.
2. Start MapEdit, press C at the swap drive question, press R, type ``LOST0'', press
   ENTER, press T, press Q, and finally press Y.
3. Run WOLF3D.EXE, and have fun!

How do i contact you about these levels?

Send an E-Mail to the above adress, and put
the text ``ZW1LOST0'' into the subject line. It
helps me sort mails.

What if i find a bug?

Let it rest in peace.
