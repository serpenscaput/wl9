WOLFENSTEIN 3-D

   Thank you for downloading my latest and possibly final set of levels.
Countdown to Disaster, my final part of the trilogy started by Assassinate
Hitler! and Schabbs 2000, never materialized for a variety of reasons. Time
constraints and a lack of interest in editing anything beyond mere levels has
led me to create this set, which is a replacement for the levels of the
original Episode 4: A Dark Secret....

Because this only contains new levels, all that is provided is:
      GAMEMAPS.WL6
      MAPHEAD.WL6 (the other 50 levels were left untouched)

Standard drill for using these, just make sure you backup the originals yadde
yadde yadde....

If I find the time (again, a BIG if), I'll do the final 20 levels comprising
Episodes 5 and 6. This would complete the Nocturnal Missions, and cover the
storyline that would've served for Countdown to Disaster in the first place.

Special thanks as always to....
