WOLF2NEW - 2 new levels for wolf3d. 03-09-1993

This archive contains two new levels for the REGISTERED version of WOLF3D.
The first two levels of the first mission have been changed into something
a *little* harder. I would have done more, but I don't have the time at the
minute. Mabey sometime . . .
I used WOLFMAP version 1.6 to create the levels. In order to keep the size 
of the archive down, I only uploaded the 2 changed levels, not the entire
GAMEMAPS.WL6 file. You WILL need a copy of WOLFMAP to install these levels.
WOLFMAP should be availiable at the same place you found this.
To install the 2 new levels, you will need to unzip the archive to extract 
the GAMEMAPS.LOC and MAPHEAD.LOC files into your wolf directory. 
WOLFMAP should also be in the same directory
Then (after backing up the old GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6 files), run
  wolfmap i 00-01
to import the new levels into the wolf map files.
Enjoy!

Hints:
  Most of the secrets are marked in some way. I *HATE* having to go
  wallbanging over every single wall to find some passage to finish the level.
  You don't have to use secrets to finish the levels. (no hidden keys)
  That is assuming you can kill Hans with only a machine gun.
  There is a secret evevator hidden on the first level though.

Please upload this to other FTP sites for me, as I have only access to a slow
internet link < 100 bytes per sec :-0    (yawning smiley)

If you liked these levels, and/or would like to persuade me to do more,
EMAIL comments,encouragement and ideas to:

I also wrote a simple platform game back in '91, but it never got past BETA. 
I may release it anyway, with full source, if anyone's interested. It does
need a faster, yet bit compatable version, of the PUTIMAGE/GETIMAGE BGI
routines for EGA 16 color graphics. (It flickers quite a lot).
If anyone has such a routine (inline assembly for TP5.0), could they send me
copy please!
