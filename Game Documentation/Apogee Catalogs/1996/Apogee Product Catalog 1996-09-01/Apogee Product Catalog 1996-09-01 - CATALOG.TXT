                                THE APOGEE MODEL
     Apogee Software pioneered the multi-episode marketing system in 1987.

 Apogee's leadership and innovations in shareware paved the way for many other
  companies to follow, such as Id Software, Interplay, Epic MegaGames, Virgin
                                 and LucasArts.

                           What is the Apogee Model?

Publishers that use the "Apogee Model" release a significant portion of their
full retail game as shareware, usually one third or one fourth of the total
game.  This shareware version is different from a demo in that it is a
complete chapter of the entire game, but often with a cliffhanger ending.
The purpose of the shareware version is to advertise the retail game, which is
bought directly from the publisher, or in retail stores.

In Apogee's case, players may buy the retail version directly, via phone or
mail, or players can find the retail version of many Apogee games available
in software stores.  (Apogee is the first company to sell game software using
both the shareware channel and the retail channel at the same time.  We
accomplished this early in 1995 with our hit 3D game, Rise of the Triad.

The Apogee Model also succeeds by encouraging friends and coworkers to pass
around our shareware games freely, without worry of violating software piracy
laws.  Apogee has always allowed anyone and everyone to pass around our
shareware games.  Each person who plays an Apogee shareware game might become
a customer by buying the retail version.

That's how the Apogee Model works, and it's no wonder that more and more
retail-only publishers are trying it with their games.  We think it's the
cutting-edge of game marketing.

Your objective: earn money in the blitzkrieg-battle races, and fight hard for
each precious championship point. Each race can be lethal, and while taking
the curves as hard as you can, your fellow competitors are showering you in
a constant hail of bullets. While the losers repair their cars and cover those
bullet holes, the winner spends his hard earned money on new engines, tires or
stronger armor.

Shoot your way through screaming bystanders, pick up more ammo and turbo from
the side of the track, and floor the pedal while performing some shady deals
for The Dealer. No trick is too dirty when you're preparing for The Final
Confrontation; only the hardest armor, the most powerful engine and the biggest
guns will see you through the ultimate battle against The Adversary.

And when you feel you can't take it anymore, you can check out the underground
market: Spiked bumpers, landmines, rocket fuel or sabotage can provide a way
to create some nasty accidents to the competition.
And for all you "clean racing" fanatics; Death Rally also has a mode where you
can race against time (so if don't want to see blood on a highway, you can
disable weapons & other dirty stuff ;) and try to beat all of those faster than
light lap records your friends keep boasting of.

Utilizing a hi-performance 3D-Engine with texture mapping, lighting effects and
shadows, Death Rally creates a level of visual impact never seen before in the
racing game genre. 100% rendered cars, animated hi-resolution menu system and a
great playability make sure that you've never had this much fun before.

Play alone or with friends, Death Rally supports network multiplaying for up to
4 players (registered version) and serial or modem connection for two players.

 (tm)   ÛÛ                     Û  is an exciting side-scrolling platform game
        ÛÛ                     İ  with an innovative mix of action, adventure,
         Û   mysticism, and role-playing that's never been seen in this style of
 game.  Set in the fantastic world of Mysteria, Realms of Chaos is the first of
 many adventures of Endrick and Elandra, a brother and sister duo who find
 themselves on a journey to save the many realms of Mysteria, from a dark, evil
 shadow that has engulfed their world, and has turned all of the inhabitants
 into fierce enemies.

 The story of the darkness is revealed as you finish each of the three game
 chapters.  Each chapter, or episode, has three unique realms--each realm has
 new enemies, new graphics, new traps and new challenges.  In all, 26 killer
 levels!

Features and innovations:

ş  Play as two different characters:  A male warrior with a devastating sword
   attack and extra stamina, and a female sorceress with a long range fireball
   attack and great leaping ability.  At any point in the game you can press a
   key to switch between characters!  It's up to you to decide which character
   is best to handle each challenge.

ş  Vibrant, realistic VGA graphics.  (Tons and tons of graphics that actually
   take you to new worlds.  You'll want to see what's behind every corner--even
   if it means running into things that want to kill you!)

ş  High speed 360 degree scrolling playfield viewed at a tilted perspective
   (gives the game a depth of view that's missing in games like Jazz
   Jackrabbit).

ş  Many unique and fantastic game puzzles that are not rehashes of what you've
   seen in other games.

ş  Some areas concentrate on fighting and action, while others concentrate on
   exploration and discovery.  This makes for fresh, exciting, and new
   challenges on every level.

ş  As part of the game's realism there's a lot of blood that flies. But, for
   younger players, we've included a blood toggle so that the game is suitable
   for all age groups.  Parents can password protect this option so that
   children cannot turn it back on.

ş  Among all the amazing enemies you'll encounter, you'll also face four
   incredible bosses, plus one final super boss!

ş  Midi-music and digital sound effects by Bobby Prince, known for his award
   winning work in Wolfenstein 3-D, DOOM I & II, and Duke Nukem 3D.  (Special
   ambient sound effects make the game seem alive!)
ş  For Paganitzu fans, there are plenty of inside references to this game,
   which was the author's first Apogee game (in 1991).

ş  Tons of secrets, bonus and hidden areas to find, making the game highly
   replayable over and over again!

ş  Five difficult levels, from "Super Easy" to "Psycho Warrior."  The higher
   secret levels actually change the game, by introducing new hazards (e.g.
   poison) and new challenges (e.g. auto-scrolling playfields)--a PC gaming
   first!

ş  Save and restore WITHIN the game levels (save anywhere) -- plus convenient
   quick save/restore buttons.

System Requirements:
--------------------
ş VGA with color monitor
ş 386-16MHZ or better (we recommend a 486+)
ş 537k of free conventional memory and 640k of either XMS/EMS memory for SFX.
ş Hard drive with approximately 3.5 megabytes of space.
ş Joystick & keyboard supported for game play.

Sound Card Support:
-------------------
For Music: Sound Blaster, Pro Audio Spectrum, Adlib, General MIDI,
           WaveBlaster, Gravis UltraSound

  For SFX: Sound Blaster, Pro Audio Spectrum, Gravis UltraSound, Disney
           Sound Source (there is no support for the PC Speaker)

The excitement in Realms of Chaos is never knowing what you'll find next.  And
each difficulty level adds new challenges to the game rather than simply making
enemies harder to kill.  Playing the game in Psycho mode is a different game
than playing in Normal mode.

All this for only $24.95.  See for yourself and try this unique and amazing
action/adventure game today.

    Can't get enough of Rise of the Triad:DarkWar?  This package is for you!

We've taken Rise of the Triad to its Extreme, and if you were a fan of the
original, prepare to have your gameplaying skills pushed to their extreme!

El Oscuro, in the moment of his death, called upon the dark powers from whence
he came.  They began a dark rite called Desatando, a ritual that literally
reverses time.  The spell took hold and has given the Dark Legions another
chance.  The HUNT, celebrating their victory, suddenly find themselves back on
San Nicolas island at the entrance to the old monastery.  Now the Oscuridos are
ready; there's more of them, they're more devious, and they're more dangerous
than ever!

Check out what you get in the EXTREME Rise of the Triad Package:

ş An all new collection of levels by Tom Hall & Joe Siegler, two of the
  original Rise of the Triad level designers!  Over 40 all-new levels total!
ş Deviously different tricks, traps, and treachery never before seen in any
  Rise of the Triad level!
ş Phenomenal firefights against the toughest Triads & meanest Monks.
ş Some of the most sadistic, brain-bending puzzles yet!
ş Escalators and moving walkways - why tire you legs out as you blow off
  someone else's?

                  The most violent 3D action game ever created!

    Here's what Chuck Miller, Editor of InterActive Entertainment, wrote:
      "Like DOOM, Rise of the Triad is a high quality, fast scrolling
   first-person perspective 3D action game.  Graphics are on par with DOOM.
      It has destructive enemies and lots of them, an arsenal of weapons
    from simple pistols to missile launchers, life-preserving armor, traps
      and ambushes galore, and the ability to play by modem or network.
     In all, there's a great degree of similarity between the two games.
    In addition, Rise of the Triad puts most of the other DOOM wannabees
                          to shameÄit's that good!"

ş Diskette Version:  $29.95 Ä You get the full game (30+ regular game levels),
  30 Comm-bat levels (for multiplayer games only), and the shareware levels.
  (Read about the Triad PowerPack below.)  NOTE: This is only available in
  3.5" HD Diskettes.

ş Triad PowerPack:  $10 Ä The Triad PowerPack is an enhancement disk that adds
  10 extra Comm-bat levels, the random level generator ("RandROTT"), and some
  BMP's and WAV files for Windows users from the game. If you buy the Diskette
  Version, you can also buy the Triad PowerPack and get everything that is
  available on the CD-ROM Version of Rise of the Triad. (Note: The Triad
  PowerPack is for those ordering the Diskette Version.  Don't order the
  PowerPack if you are buying the CD-ROM Version.)

ş CD-ROM Version:  $34.95 Ä (Also called "Super Triad".)  This enhanced version
  is the same as the Diskette Version combined with the Triad PowerPack.  You
  get the full game, the 30 extra Comm-bat levels, the eight shareware levels,
  BMP and WAV files (more than the PowerPack), and the random level generator
  ("RandROTT"), for unlimited new game levels.

"It's got kick, it's got power...it's sure to hit the target."
                          Ä Computer Gaming World

Quick Highlights:
ş  Super huge levels Ä up to one million sq. feet, and up to 16 stories high!
ş  Ten unique, real digitized enemies.
ş  Thirteen hardcore weapons, including magical weapons.
ş  Nearly every object can be destroyed Ä even mark walls with bullet holes!
ş  Modem and network playable, up to 11 players via an IPX compatible network.
ş  Adjustable violence/gore levels, from none (for children) to "excessive"!

"Rise of the Triad provides everything an action gamer could want.  Blistering
action and a sense of humor make ROTT one of the year's favorites."
                          Ä Computer Game Review

The Story:
You are part of an elite group of operatives called HUNT (High-risk United
Nations Taskforce), and you must stop a maniac cult leader from killing
millions of people.  While scouting a remote island, you are suddenly
surrounded by enemy troops with guns blaring.  In the distance you see your
boat--your only chance to escape--explode into matchsticks.  In front of you
is a huge fortress monastery, and your only chance to stop the madness.

You are equipped with awesome, high-tech weaponry like heat-seeking missiles,
split missiles, and the FlameWall cannon, which leaves a trail of charred
skeletons in its wake.  You'll also find magical instruments and weapons so
incredible they defy description.

"Cool features is what this game is about."  Ä Computer Gaming World

Features:
ş 20 Megabytes of explosive graphics, animations, music and digitized sounds!
ş Play one of five players, each with unique attributes and abilities.  (This
  makes the game highly replayable, since it's a different experience with
  each of the five players, including two female players.  (In modem or
  network play, each player can can select what they want to look like.)
ş Look both up and down, up to 45 degrees, to see what is above and below.
ş Ten unique, digitized enemies in the game, plus four multi-stage bosses!
ş 15 incredible game hazards, like SpinBlades, gun bunkers, huge boulders,
  FireJets, pits, FireChutes, LavaWalls, gas grates, and more.
ş Special effects galore:  Fog, lightning with properly delayed thunder,
  parallaxing skies, real lights that illuminate walls (you can shoot the
  lights and the room gets darker), ricocheting bullets, wind sounds, and more.
ş Jump pads will spring you up into the air to jump over obstacles, walls,
  other players, (great in multiplayer games) and even to reach new weapons.
ş Many useful objects and power-ups, like a fireproof vest, gas mask,
  Mercury mode (enables the player to fly!), and even a special "god" and
  "dog" modes, both making the player invincible for a short time (with
  hilarious side effects).

"This is the most multiplayer-friendly game we've seen, supporting both two
player modem matches and 11-player network-fests.  In addition, there are
nine types of multiplayer games available with many customizable options."
                         Ä Computer Gaming World

Nowadays, gamers have discovered the adrenaline pumping fun of playing against
each other, either over a modem or on a network. Rise of the Triad is the most
sophisticated, feature-packed multiplayer PC game ever made.  And that's not
hype.  If you're into multiplayer games Rise of the Triad will knock you out.
In fact, our multiplayer support is so good we trademarked the word "Comm-bat"
so that players will know it's special.  What multiplayer gaming means is that
two players (via modem), or two through eleven players (via network) can enter
a special Comm-bat level and go to war against each other.

Rise of the Triad has nine different Comm-bat games, including Capture the
Triad, which is a popular paintball game with teams of players on each side.
(And since players can choose their own shirt colors from 11 choices, it's
easy to have team competitions.)

Multiplayer Features:
ş Supports modem, serial cable, and network multiplayer games with more
  specialized options than any game previously released.
ş Network games up to 11 players!
ş Each player can select one of the five unique characters, plus each player
  can choose from one of 11 uniform colors.  (In team games, each team has
  the same uniform color.)
ş Nine unique Comm-bat games, such as Eluder, Capture the Triad, and Hunter.
ş RemoteRidicule allows players to send digitized voice messages to other
  players.  With a microphone, a player can even speak directly to the other
  players in network games!  Great for team play or taunting others.
ş Play Comm-bat games in the normal game levels, OR use the special Comm-bat
  levels, which are specifically designed for fun multiplayer games.

"I've played ROTT and it's good.  REEEEEEEEEEEEALLY good!  Honestly, I can't
think of any reason why every DOOM nut in the country won't flock to this
game when it's released.  It's beautiful, fast and challenging.  Rise of the
Triad is truly an awesome game."  Ä Interactive Entertainment

(Only the full version, for $29.95, has the level editor.)

Boppin' is a fun, addictive puzzle game disguised as an arcade game.  Each
screen in Boppin' (160 in the full version) is a unique puzzle with varied
graphics.  The game is easy to learn, and the built-in instructions are easy
to understand.

The object of the game is to solve all 40 levels of each of the four episodes,
and then defeat the end-of-level boss.  Each episode has a lead-in story and
different endings depending on how well you did.  After episode four there is
a special ending that wraps up the entire story.  Defeating the ending boss for
each episode is made easier by doing well (by accumulating points) on the 40
levels for that episode.

The idea on each level is to grab "bopping blocks" and use them to complete
patterns on the level.  Certain patterns will free a video game character
that you might recognize from dozens of other arcade/action games (i.e.
Space Invaders and Pac Man).

There are several strategies and skills to learn, and one or two players
can play at the same time at the same computer.  Every level also has a
"mystery spot" (awards 10x extra points for a limited time) and a way to
get a "perfect bonus" (if you solve all puzzles on a level).

A great feature of Boppin' is its built-in level editor ($29.95 version only).
With this editor you can devise any number of new levels, or play levels
designed by other players.  (New Boppin' levels will likely be available on
our home BBS and other online services, such as CompuServe and America Online.)
Only the full version of Boppin' can play levels that have been created by
other players.

Cool Boppin' Features:
* 256 color VGA graphics and animations.
* Full version has 160 amazingly varied levels/puzzles to solve.
* Full version also has a built-in level editor for designing your own levels.
* One OR two player modes, allowing two players to cooperate at the same time.
* Four episodes, each with a great lead in story with a graphics story.
* Each of the four episodes has a unique ending boss to beat.
* General Midi music system supporting most major cards, plus digital sounds.
* Levels are filled with devious puzzles, mysteries, secrets and bonuses.
* Play with joystick or keyboard.
* Save/restore games.

System requirements:
* VGA with color monitor
* 386-16MHZ or better.
* 2 megs of ram.
* Hard drive with approximately 2 megabytes of space.
* Joystick strongly recommended (required for two player mode).
* Mouse recommended for editor (joystick can be used).

            "Wacky Wheels:  A fun, action-packed 3D racing game
                  you can play alone or against friends!"

Nothing beats the excitement of playing against other human racers, and in
Wacky Wheels, you can do just that.  You and a friend can play at the same
computer (split-screen mode), or play head-to-head using a modem connection,
or via serial (null-modem) cable.

Or, you can race against challenging computer opponents who have adjustable
degrees of difficulty.  Either way, Wacky Wheels is packed with the features
you want: non-stop action and variety, heart-racing music and furious 3D
point-of-view vivid VGA graphics and animations.  It's so fun, you'll hate to
finish.

                          The wild kingdom of racing!
You can play any of eight wacky animals in Wacky Wheels.  Each animal has its
own colorful antics and animations, including a tiger, elephant, raccoon, panda,
shark, and more.

Here's the good part:  These animals are not wimpy racers, they are very
competitive.  They hate to lose!  We've programmed each racer with a artificial
intelligence and they take great joy in bumping you and zooming past you when
you spin off the track.  (As each racer passes you they turn their head toward
and honk their horn.)

                     You get several games in one package!
In Wacky Wheels, you get six unique racing game modes.  Including time trials,
normal racing (with many variations), battle zones, and the just-for-fun duck
shoot-outs.  With so many ways to play, you can count on this staying fun for a
long time--we've built in a lot of play value.

Take for example, the duck shoot-outs.  The shoot-outs take place on special
battle zones, which are not designed for racing.  The object is to race around
a huge, wide open area, full of obstacles, and maze-like walls, all the while
collecting ammo and shooting at the ducks-on-wheels.  If you think it sounds
funny, wait until you play it.  It's funnier than you think!

Some ducks only take one shot to pluck, others (with helmets) require two
shots.  You get a limited time to shoot as many as you can and earn a spot on
the high score chart, bumping off you family and friends.

Nothing beats the competitive feel of racing.  Feel the thrill as you race past
your opponent, slam their car into a water trap, and beat them by a bumper to
the finish line.

You won't want to finish because Wacky Wheels is too exciting:  Avoiding the
obstacles, knocking against opponents, launching your weapons against them,
beating them to the short cuts, engaging turbo mode on the straightaway, using
your hand brake to skillfully hug tight corners without spinning out, and
hitting jumps with perfect timing so that you sail above and past your
opponents while executing a perfect 360 rotation in midair!

                       You get 15 original race tracks
After you select your wacky race character, you get to select any of 21 unique
race tracks (42 in the "Upgrade Edition").  Each track has a distinctive
winning strategy.  It's up to you to figure out the best way race each one.

There are three classes of tracks, from novice to expert, which present a wide
range of wacky racing conditions.  There's also two racing speeds, normal and
radical.  Beginning players should not attempt to play at the higher speed!

All tracks have special obstacles and dangers:  Water traps, cacti, oil
slicks, posts, stacks of tires, and more.  Some tracks are surrounded by water
(you can race underwater!) and even lava.

                         Wacky weapons help you win!
But what you're not expecting is the hedgehogs!  Grab all the track-populated
hedgehogs you can and hurl them like baseballs at the other racers to send them
spinning out of control Ä giving you time to pass 'em by.  Other weapons to
collect include bombs, oil slicks, ice blocks, and flame balls.
                          High-speed racing action
Apogee games are action-packed, and Wacky Wheels is a perfect example.  From
start to finish you get edge-of-your-seat excitement and action.  When playing,
you'll grit your teeth, lean your body into the corners and scream "EAT MAGMA!"
as you launch a hedgehog that sends the racer in front of you spinning into the
lava!

And nothing beats the excitement of racing head-to-head against your friends.
Two players can compete on the same computer (split-screen mode) or using
modems.  Two players can race each other, or battle in one of the six Comm-bat
zones that are included.

Winning features:
* High-speed 3D point-of-view racing!
* Large variety of race tracks.  (42 total in the "Upgrade Edition".)
* 16 heart-racing songs, with superb digital sound effects, with native
  support for the GUS, PAS-16, Sound Canvas, SB 16/Pro, WaveBlaster and all
  General MIDI cards.
* Two-player, head-to-head modes via modem connection, serial link or at the
  same computer.
* Time trials mode, allows you to go for a record time on each track.
* RemoteRidicule(tm) feature, allows you to send a funny, distracting, or
  informational message to your opponent during modem matches.
* Opponents are programmed to be very competitive.
* 60 high score charts--one for each of the unique racing options.
* Giggle keys, which allow you to send funny messages to your opponents.
* Many cheat passwords, and a secret ammo power-up key.

Requires 386 or better with 4 meg of memory & VGA graphics.

Terexin, leader of the Council of Wizards, is sending the young sorcerer,
Hocus, on a special mission to prove his worthiness.  This mission will take
Hocus to 16 unique realms, each filled with unique dangers and enemies.
Few have survived Terexin's final test--for many it's a one-way trip.

Along the way Hocus will encounter dragons, imps, ghosts and 30 more unique
creatures, demons and enemies.  Survive, and Hocus becomes a full-fledged,
card carrying Wizard.  The other option is not so favorable.
Awesome and beautiful 256-color VGA graphics.  After every two levels of play
the level graphics, background and enemies completely change, giving this
game unparalleled variety.  Hocus Pocus is a action platform game, with
exciting puzzles built into each level's structure.

Hocus is armed with a standard magic spell (he's not yet a full Wizard,
after all), but he can find several potions that give him a temporary boost
of magical energy.  There are potions that give Hocus the ability to shoot
rapidly, jump higher, teleport and fire a devastating energy blast, among
others.

* Smooth 360 degree scrolling, with a parallax background.
* Over SIX MEGS of 256-color VGA animated graphics.
* Four episodes with 36 huge levels!

playability, and comes close to DOOM."  -- PC Review

Many players have wondered how Apogee would follow the success of Wolfenstein.

more firepower, more graphics, more animation, more pitfalls and many more
features.  Like built-in auto-mapping, so you never have to worry about getting
lost in the game.

"Blake Stone...isn't simply Son of Wolfenstein...it's a wish list fulfilled,
enhancing the Wolfenstein canon with many sensible tweaks and some new tricks
that'll make your jaw drop." -- Electronic Entertainment

You're pitted against Dr. Pyrus Goldfire.  He's found a way to replicate pure
gold, which he's using to fund his maniacal plan.  Goldfire has built six
highly secure, futuristic locations where his creations are being hatched. It's
up to you to penetrate his security and stop him at all costs.

Upon ordering you'll receive the Blake Stone manual, which includes a comic
style illustrated story that leads you into the game.  You'll also get the
secret cheat code which gives full health, all the weapons, full ammo, and all
the key cards (giving you access to every area in the game).

Duke Nukem II is everything you'd want from an action game.  An incredibly
sophisticated game engine gives this high-action game the power needed to
'nuke' your computer!  Duke blasts his way through your screen with enough
firepower to wake your neighbors.

The original Duke Nukem, released June 1991, soared to the top of the Shareware
Top 10 list, where's it's been camped for 22 straight months--no other
shareware program (of any type) has been this enduring and popular.  But the
reason for Duke's extraordinary success is simple:  It delivers the action
players love, with state-of-the-art animation and graphics.  The new Duke
Nukem II once again sets the new standard for arcade/action games.
In this latest saga, Duke Nukem, while being interviewed on TV about his best
selling book, "Why I'm So Great", is suddenly abducted by aliens.  Duke's alien
captor explains that Duke's brain will be drained of all his knowledge,
which will be used to formulate a master plan to seize control of Earth.  Duke
has two choices:  He can be turned into a zombie by the EncephaloSucker, or
'kick-butt' like there's no tomorrow!

You guessed it!  Our hero is ready for action.  Duke must escape his alien
prison cell, then battle to end the hideous plans of the Rigelatins.

We're talkin':
* Vivid, parallaxing graphics, with new graphics on every level!
* Ad Lib music and digitized (Sound Blaster/compatible) sound effects.
* Super boss enemies to defeat.
* Special abilities, like invincibility for a short time.
* Duke rides in space shuttle fighter on many levels, for varied action.
* 32 action oriented levels in four tremendous episodes.
* Nearly every level presents a wildly unique scenario for Duke to escape.
* Enemies, mutations, robo-droids, guards, traps--all after the escaped Duke!
* Built-in radar to help Duke on each level.
* Save/restore, skill levels, cheat modes, secrets, joystick/gamepad support.
* Game story by Tom Hall--the writer of all of Id Software's game stories.
* Special graphics effects never before seen in an IBM PC game.
* Requires a VGA graphics card.

For fans of the original Duke Nukem, all of your favorite touches are still
here:  soda cans for health, turkey for food, spy cameras watching your every
move, boxes you can destroy for bonuses and surprises, and more.  Duke still
flips, and he walks hand over hand across pipes, chains and ropes, with the
new ability of shooting downward while doing so.  Duke can also crouch, duck,
and shoot upward.

Also, in Duke Nukem II, Duke has four weapons: blaster, laser cannon, missiles,
and flame thrower.  The flame thrower, when aimed downward, propels Duke
upward like a jetpack!

As with the original Duke Nukem, this game has many secret bonuses for you to
discover while playing the game, that really add to your high score.  (For
example, shoot all the spy cameras on a level for an extra 50,000 points.)

           This is the original, award-winning series of Duke Nukem!
                    $29.95 for all three kick-butt episodes!

An incredible EGA game (VGA compatible) with large animated characters, and
huge levels.  Your mission is to stop Dr. Proton, a madman bent on ruling the
world with his army of Techbots.  As the irrepressible hero Duke Nukem, you'll
chase Dr. Proton deep into the Earth, then to his lunar space station, and
eventually into the Earth's nuclear ravished future.

This is an astonishing Sega Genesis style game with amazing animation!  Also
features dual scrolling play fields, with huge 3D-like backdrops.  Watch Duke
somersault and cling on to ceilings as he escapes traps and battles Proton's
robot guards.  This game is a real show stopper!

Other features include four-way scrolling levels, cinematic effects, demo
mode, built-in hint mode, arcade sound effects, joystick support, high score
chart, save/restore up to nine games, unlimited continues, keyboard
reconfigure, sound on/off toggle, cheat mode, and much more...

            (This game was previously named "HALLOWEEN HARRY".)
         $19.95 for all FOUR incredibly animated and scary missions!

 *** Due to amazing ANIMATION, this game requires a fast 286 or better. ***

Alien Carnage, starring the hero, Halloween Harry" is an impressive game with
no detail overlooked.  Professional musical soundtrack, brilliant full-VGA
graphics, non-stop animation and huge start-game and end-game cinematics.

If Duke Nukem has a twin separated at birth, it's got to be the character of
Halloween Harry!  Harry has an armory of weapons he can find and use, besides
the devastating flame thrower that he starts the game with.  And Harry's jet
pack takes him to spots on a level that normal heroes could not reach.

Earth is on the verge of a takeover by aliens intent on turning humans into
mindless slave zombies, who can be used in their conquest of the universe.
Harry's called into action to Space Station Liberty, and given orders to
penetrate the alien ship which has burrowed itself under a high-rise city.

In addition to the flame thrower, Harry can use weapons dispensers he finds
during the game, giving him weapons like the photon cannon, guided missiles,
grenades, shields, micro nukes, and the very powerful Omega bomb.  It's an
arsenal that will have the aliens shakin' in their slimy shoes.

STUNNING FEATURES:
* One of the best 256-color VGA "platform" game ever seen on the IBM PC.
* Ear-popping DIGITIZED Sound Blaster music and digital sound effects.
* Over a dozen cinematic sequences.
* Huge "boss" aliens in each of the four missions.
* Absorbing integrated (and funny) story, which proceeds each mission.
* Incredible VGA graphics and animation.
* Built-in radar mode to help Harry locate hostages on each level.
* Many secrets and bonuses to discover--lots of replay value.
* Save/restore, joystick support, cheat mode, three skill levels, and more.

Be sure to check the shareware version (mission one) on our home BBS, and
you'll see why everyone is so impressed by Alien Carnage.  If you like
high-octane action with a mix of clever and humorous characters, you'll LOVE
this game.  To order, call 1-800-APOGEE1, or use the ORDER.FRM file.

You are Snake Logan, a top CIA operative who likes to do things his own way.
Metro City has fallen under the attack of hideous mutants and your mission is
to fly recon over the city and report back.  While circling over the city
you're shot down by hostile forces and forced to crash land on the streets of
Metro.  Grabbing what supplies you can find you are out to discover the source
of these mutants and especially the guy who shot you down!

Intelligence reports indicate that a man calling himself Dr. Mangle is
responsible for the mutants and the destruction of Metro.  You will have to
battle your way through many levels packed with evil mutants and robotic guards
to finally infiltrate Mangle's fortress and defeat him.  You think to yourself
that this will be the most dangerous mission of your life.

Exciting Features:
* Developed using a game engine developed by Id Software, designers of Doom.
* Fantastically animated creatures and menacing robotic enemies to outwit.
* Non-stop, Duke Nukem-style, kick-'em-in-the-butt, shoot-everything action!
* Exciting and brilliantly drawn graphics, with stunning variety and realism.
* Full Ad Lib music soundtrack and sound effects.
* Big boss creatures to battle!
* Several weapons at your disposal, plus four secret weapons and maneuvers!
* Many secret areas to discover.
* Three skill levels.  Joystick support.  Save and restore games.

Snake Logan is a weapons expert, and uses several throughout the game,
including a high-powered machine gun (you NEED to hear the sound effect for
this!) and grenades.  Snake can also perform special maneuvers, like the one
described here:

SUPER PLASMA BOLT:  Hold the up arrow, (or up on the joystick), until you hear
an electrical charge sound.  Once you hear this sound, press the fire button
and a plasma beam will shoot in the direction you are facing burning through
a whole line of enemies!  Beware, this is a powerful weapon and the toxic fume
cloud it leaves behind inflicts one point of damage on Snake!  Use this weapon
wisely and carefully!

Other secret maneuvers include the FIRE BALL ATTACK, the ELECTRON SHIELD, and
the INVINCIBILITY BURST.  But you'll have to discover these while playing the
game.

Johnny Dash's bash 'em smash 'em adventure takes him into the evil Under
World of Count Chuck.  The story starts when Johnny's dog Tex is kidnapped by
the Count, along with hundreds of other pet dogs and cats.  The friendly bed
monster under Johnny's bed tells Johnny where Tex was taken, and how Johnny can
use his secret closet passageway to get to the Under World himself. Count Chuck
plans to turn all the pets into an army of undead monsters.

Johnny grabs his slingshot and leaps into his closet.  The Count will not turn
his dog Tex into a monster, not if he can stop him...!

Monster Bash is full of scary action and haunting puzzles.  No previous Apogee
game has featured so much ANIMATION.  For instance, Johnny can climb, crawl,
shoot his slingshot in several directions, fly a broom, and a lot more.  And
Johnny's super charged slingshot can shoot rocks, rockets, fireballs, and other
surprises.  There also more enemy creatures and monsters than ever seen in an
Apogee game.

The story:  You're William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the Allies' bad boy of
espionage and a terminal action seeker.  Your mission was to infiltrate the
Nazi fortress Castle Hollehammer and find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust,
the Nazi's blueprint for building the perfect army.  Rumors are that deep
within the castle the diabolical Dr. Schabbs has perfected a technique for
building a fierce army from the bodies of the dead.  It's so far removed from
reality that it would seem silly if it wasn't so sick.  But what if it were
true?

As an escaped prisoner in a Nazi war prison, you will move smoothly through
a 3D world full of amazing detail and animation.  Unlike other 3D games,
you'll run through a sensational and realistic 3-D environment, with
intelligent moving guards and opponents.

    *** Due to content this game may not be ordered by German residents. ***

This is a special commercial edition of the Wolfenstein 3-D saga, once again
starring the Allies' most durable agent, B.J. Blazkowicz.  In the midst of
the Nazi Blitzkrieg, the Spear that pierced the side of Christ is taken from
the Versailles and secured in the impregnable Castle Nuremberg.  According to
legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear.  Hitler believes himself
to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his army of destruction sweeps
across Europe.  (Historian's Note:  This mission actually takes place before
the original Wolfenstein 3-D game.)

Your mission is to recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler, with
the hope that the loss of his most coveted weapon will push him over the edge!
You must infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and time is running
out!

This is a full-sized epic game, not just an episode.  It has more than 20 huge
levels, four new fantastic boss enemies, new music and digitized stereo
sounds, new graphics, an incredibly scary ending, and much more.

There is not a shareware version of this game available, but you can be sure
that if you liked the original Wolfenstein 3-D six episodes, you'll like
this newer action-packed game even more.  Only $29!  Note:  The commercial
version, which is the exact same game Apogee offers, sells for $49--you save
$19 by ordering directly from Apogee.  Just call 1-800-APOGEE1 or use the
ORDER.FRM file to mail in your order.

       protection scheme to prevent illegal software pirating.

Earth was invaded by alien marauders--the Kretons.  Earth's united military
force, still depleted after the mighty onslaught of WWIII, was not nearly
sufficient to repel the numerous Kreton attacks.

It was discovered that the Kretons had used a wormhole to invade our region
of space from their home worlds.  And with that knowledge Earth called into
action Major Harrison Stryker, hero of WWIII, to travel back through the
wormhole and destroy the Kreton's home world headquarters.

With almost no chance of success, you accept the mission...

Major Stryker is the first Apogee game with "triple-parallax scrolling",
adding to the illusion of depth and danger.  Your mission is to pilot a
high-powered, armored space ship through dozens of stunning scenarios, such
as space stations, lava caves and alien cities.

Exciting features:
* Ad Lib music and Sound Blaster digitized effects.
* EGA high-speed animated graphics (VGA compatible).
* Cinematic sequences.
* Unlike any other Apogee game yet.
* Full of bonuses and secrets to discover.
* Save and restore up to 10 games.
* Play with joystick or keyboard.
* Exciting demo mode.

Apogee enters the educational arena with a program that teaches spelling,
logic, word meanings and reading--yet is as compelling to play as our other
top games!

Built with a similar system that we used to create Duke Nukum, Word Rescue is
an incredible adventure for kids who want to rescue all the stolen words from
the mean ol' Gruzzles.  The Gruzzles can't read, and they don't want anyone
else to read.  So, they've stolen the words out of all of our books!

Benny Bookworm needs your help to stop the Gruzzles.  He needs you to reunite
the stolen words with their meanings.  Once you join all the words with their
pictures, Benny will put them back into the books.

This is an engrossing educational game with vivid EGA/VGA graphics and support
for Ad Lib and Sound Blaster.  Using the Duke Nukum graphical system, Word
Rescue has state-of-the-art dual-screen scrolling graphics similar to what's
seen on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis home gaming systems.  Even
"grown-ups" will like Word Rescue!

Word Rescue is designed for a range of players of all ages:
 Easy level:    Ages 4 - 7  (Even pre readers can play the game.)
 Medium level:  Ages 7 - 10
 Hard level:    Ages 10 and up  (A challenge for adults, too!)

Play as either a girl, or a boy!  You get to choose which character you wish
to play, either male or female.  Either way, you'll visit amazing locations
on your word finding adventure.  As you hunt for all the missing words you'll
visit dark caves, rocky cliffs, deserts, happy towns, scary haunted houses,
funny factories, creepy dungeons, and many others.

* Finally, educational software that's fun to play!
* Three unique multi-level adventures, with 330 words to rescue.

It all begins when Billy Blaze's baby sitter is stolen by a mean bunch of
hungry aliens from the planet Fribbulus Xax.  She is going to be the main
course for dinner!  With your parents due home soon, how will you be able to
tell them, "The aliens ate my baby sitter!"?

Your galactic rescue mission will have you battling the dangerous aliens of
Fribbulus Xax, while collecting goodies to help you along the way.  Tons of
secret areas to discover, plus you'll need to find a way to get to the space
fortress orbiting high above the planet.

NOTE:  Over 2.5 Megs of EGA (VGA compatible) graphics!!!

AD LIB MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS.  A full musical soundtrack accompanies Keen
on his alien adventure.  Also features three skill levels, gigantic scrolling
levels, ultra-smooth animation and screen effects, save/restore games,
joystick support, and much more!  When Billy gets bored, he can even play a
computer game on his specially built watch.

You're agent 006«, top agent of the government's secret organization committed
to protecting the world against terrorists and power-mad criminals.

Your mission is to parachute into a high-security island outpost and secure
the plans to the ultimate satellite laser weapon, which was recently stolen
from the government.  In the wrong hands this weapon could mean world control
by the DVS, the world's most dangerous terrorist organization.

You are isolated from outside help as you parachute into the secret island
fortress of the DVS.  You will need to knock out the vast security system,
bypass dozens of extreme traps, overcome hundreds of multi-talented guards
(such as thugs, ninjas, sharp-shooters, knife throwers, sentries, dogs, and
many robots), and find the missing blue prints.  If possible, take out the
devious leader of the DVS (sorry, no file picture available).
Secret Agent is a full-screen scrolling game, where you sneak around a huge
map and enter various hideouts.  In each unique hideout you'll search for the
laser blue prints, dodge traps, solve puzzles, and blast the bad guys!  All
in good fun.  Save/restore, joystick support, EGA graphics (VGA compatible),

Journey into an Aztec pyramid and survive the adventure of a lifetime! No
other game forces you to die in order to complete it!  That's just one of many
incredible plot twists in this excellent puzzle-oriented arcade/adventure game.

In Paganitzu you'll guide your character, Alabama Smith (Al), into a vast and
dangerous Aztec pyramid. Indiana Jones never had it so tough! Inside, you'll
confront traps of increasing perplexity, and creatures you never dreamed
existed.

This is a genuine adventure--not just a series of levels to conquer.  You can
follow different routes to achieve the winning goal.  In fact, you can finish
Paganitzu and still have missed many of the game's intriguing situations or
animated sequences.

Phenomenal animated sequences carry you through the entire pyramid and to a
dramatic conclusion.  Stunning EGA graphics (VGA compatible).

In part one, "Romancing the Rose", Al discovers that the ancient Aztec
pyramid, known as "Paganitzu", holds many dark secrets.  Al inadvertently
releases a spirit of immense power, who's desire is to ravage the world.

Part two, "The Silver Dagger", finds Al exploring deeper into the Aztec ruin,
in search of clues to help halt the powerful force he's released. Al enters
a world of fiery devastation, filled with all new graphics and perils.  This
game has two huge animated sequences that are worth the price of admission in
themselves!

Finally, in part three, "Jewel of the Yucatan", Al discovers the horrifying
truth--the pyramid of Paganitzu is actually a living entity, which he could
not see as a living person!  Can Al still save the world?  Will he escape with
his life!  The chilling end awaits...?

Paganitzu is an innovative arcade game.  It tests your mind more than your
finger speed.  Each part has new puzzles, new graphics, and stunning story
surprises.  You won't be bored!

Enter an underground world of treasures and traps.  This colorful EGA game
(VGA compatible) rivals any commercial game with its arcade quality, puzzles
and graphics.  As Mylo Steamwitz, you'll enter cave after cave of adventure,
gathering the treasures of each, while evading hazards galore!  This game
features the smoothest animated graphics ever seen in an Apogee game.

The game begins with Mylo rocketing to the Altairian star system on a simple
treasure hunt.  But what happens is far more dangerous than even Mylo
bargained for.  He enters an underground world of chambers full of alien
technology and traps.  Strange alien creatures and robots inhabit the caves,
protecting the priceless crystals from money-greedy explorers.

Crystal Caves is a mixing of Nintendo's Mario Brothers, Commander Keen, and
Indiana Jones.  As with all Apogee games, a high priority has been placed on
solving ingenious puzzles built into the game.

Variety is also evident in Crystal Caves.  On some levels Mylo will even walk
up-side-down!  Other levels have such low gravity that the recoil from Mylo's
laser pistol can knock him into other dangers!  Some levels are without
lights, and others are packed full of falling hammers, egg-dropping alien
bats, free roaming slither eyes, web-shooting alien spiders, and much, much
more.  Each level has all new graphics!

There are three unique episodes to the Crystal Caves saga:  "The Trouble with
Twibbles", "Slugging it Out", and "Mylo Verses the Supernova".  Each episode
has a unique story twist and graphics.  Can you help Mylo strike it rich and
quit his day job?

  break new ground, push the envelope, and set ourselves apart.  Please send
  us any samples or demos of your programming talents.

ş ARTISTS NEEDED for inhouse game development!  Please send at least ten
  samples of your VGA art for us to review.  We need many, many artists.  All
  inhouse positions are salaried and include excellent royalties, too.  Please
  send your submissions to Apogee and mark them to the attention of "In House
  Development".

ş GAME SUBMISSIONS WELCOME.  Please send your demo or beta to Apogee and
  address the package to "Submissions Manager".  Or, if you have a new game
  engine, we'd like to see that, too.
