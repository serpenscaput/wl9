                         $35 for all three episodes!

    *** Due to intense ANIMATION, this game requires a 286 or faster. ***

Brief Feature List:
* Over 8 Megs total animated and scrolling EGA/VGA graphics.
* Full Ad Lib music soundtrack.
* Digitized sound effects and voice effects for Sound Blaster.
* Opening and closing animated/cinematic sequences.
* Joystick supported.
* Three skill levels, save/restore up to 10 games, plus built in hints.

Johnny Dash's bash 'em smash 'em adventure takes him into the evil Under
World of Count Chuck.  No Apogee game has ever had as much gruesome graphics
as Monster Bash, with over EIGHT MEGS of animated/scrolling graphics in all
three monstrous episodes.

The story starts when Johnny's dog Tex is kidnapped by the Count, along with
hundreds of other pet dogs and cats.  The friendly bed monster under Johnny's
bed tells Johnny where Tex was taken, and how Johnny can use his secret closet
passageway to get to the Under World himself.  Count Chuck plans to turn all
the pets into an army of undead monsters.

Johnny grabs his slingshot and leaps into his closet.  The Count will not turn
his dog Tex into a monster, not if he can stop him...!

Monster Bash is full of scary action and haunting puzzles.  No previous Apogee
game has featured so much ANIMATION.  For instance, Johnny can climb, crawl,
shoot his slingshot in several directions, fly a broom, and a lot more.  And
Johnny's super charged slingshot can shoot rocks, rockets, fireballs, and other
surprises.  There also more enemy creatures and monsters than ever seen in an
Apogee game.

If you'd like a preview of this game, you can download #1MB-PIX.ZIP (160k) from
the Apogee BBS.  This self-running slide show (with music from Monster Bash,
too) shows exciting screens from all three episodes--you're sure to be stunned!

To order, call 1-800-GAME-123 during business hours, or use the ORDER.FRM file.

MONSTER BASH TEE SHIRTS are also available in 100% combed cotton.  All tees
are black, with full-color action illustration on the front and the red Apogee
logo on the back.  Price: $14.  Sizes:  S  M  L  XL  XXL.

2) Get the first trilogy, plus a second trilogy for a total of $50 (plus $4
   shipping). In other words, for an extra $15 you can double the size of

   trilogy is $20.)  The second set of levels provides an entirely unique
   mission, with new level designs and new "boss" enemies to overcome.  You
   cannot play the second trilogy unless you have the first trilogy.  The
   first trilogy price ($35) includes the game engine that lets you also play
   the second, alternate trilogy, titled "The Nocturnal Missions".

NOTE:  When ordering Wolfenstein 3-D, please let us know if you can use
       HIGH-DENSITY disks, either 1.2meg or 1.44meg.

Wolfenstein 3-D is simply a technology breakthrough!  The first person
perspective 3-D game play you'll be viewing is the fastest of any PC game
game--much faster than that seen in Origin System's The Stygian Abyss!

Incredible Sound Blaster digitized sound effects are used throughout the game. 
Note:  The shareware version has just a limited sampling of digitized effects. 
To get ALL of the digitized effects, you must buy the full trilogy.  Sound
Blaster Pro owners will hear the digitized effects in STEREO!

The story:  You're William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the Allies' bad boy of
espionage and a terminal action seeker.  Your mission was to infiltrate the
Nazi fortress Castle Hollehammer and find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust,
the Nazi's blueprint for building the perfect army.  Rumors are that deep
within the castle the diabolical Dr. Schabbs has perfected a technique for
building a fierce army from the bodies of the dead.  It's so far removed from
reality that it would seem silly if it wasn't so sick.  But what if it were
true?

You were never given the chance to find out!  Captured in your attempt to grab
the secret plans, you were taken to the Nazi prison, Castle Wolfenstein, for
questioning and eventual execution.  Will you be able to escape and finish
your world-saving mission?

As an escaped prisoner in a Nazi war prison, you will move smoothly through
a 3-D world full of amazing detail and animation.  Unlike other 3-D games,
you'll move SMOOTHLY through a sensational and realistic 3-D environment, with
intelligent moving guards and opponents.

This is a high-action game.  Use your rapid fire machine gun to mow down a
line of enemies, or sneak up on a guard with your knife so you don't waste
your limited ammunition.  Id Software, the creators of Commander Keen, have
broken new ground with their all-new Wolfenstein 3-D.

ş Intense and mood-setting Ad Lib music throughout the entire game.
ş Incredible digitized effects for Sound Blaster and Disney Sound Source.
ş Fastest 3-D VGA animated full-screen wide game available for IBM PC!
ş Play with keyboard, joystick, mouse or Gravis GamePad.
ş Save and restore games, plus quick-save and quick-load hot keys.
ş Must be played on an 80286 or better machine.  Does not run on XT systems.

PARENTAL WARNING:  Wolfenstein 3-D, due to its intensely realistic visuals,
is recommended for children above 12 years of age.  For younger players we
recommend parental approval.  We have voluntarily rated this game PC-13,
(Profound Carnage!), which equates to violence seen in a PG-13 movie.

Ordering information for Wolfenstein 3-D is explained above.  Or read the
ORDER.FRM file.  To order, call 1-800-GAME123.

WOLFENSTEIN 3-D TEE SHIRTS are available in 100% combed cotton.  All tees are

on the back the phrase "You don't bring a knife to a machine gun fight!".  Also

        *** AN ALL-NEW MISSION WITH 20 NEW LEVELS AND MUCH MORE! ***

This is a special commercial edition of the Wolfenstein 3-D saga, once again
starring the Allies' most durable agent, B.J. Blazkowicz.  In the midst of
the Nazi Blitzkrieg, the Spear that pierced the side of Christ is taken from
the Versailles and secured in the impregnable Castle Nuremberg.  According to
legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear.  Hitler believes himself
to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his army of destruction sweeps
across Europe.  (Historian's Note:  This mission actually takes place before
the original Wolfenstein 3-D game.)

Your mission is to recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler, with
the hope that the loss of his most coveted weapon will push him over the edge!
You must infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and time is running
out!

This is a full-sized epic game, not just an episode.  It has more than 20 huge
levels, four new fantastic boss enemies, new music and digitized stereo
sounds, new graphics, an incredibly scary ending, and much more.

There is not a shareware version of this game available, but you can be sure
that if you liked the original Wolfenstein 3-D six episodes, you'll like
this newer action-packed game even more.  Only $35!  Note:  The commercial
version, which is the exact same game Apogee offers, sells for $59--you save
$24 by ordering directly from Apogee.  Just call 1-800-GAME123 or use the
ORDER.FRM file to mail in your order.

(Order the original six episodes, plus Spear of Destiny, all for $85.)

In the not-so-distant future the calamity of World War III led to eventual
world peace.  But it did not last...

Earth was invaded by alien marauders--the Kretons.  Earth's united military
force, still depleted after the mighty onslaught of WWIII, was not nearly
sufficient to repel the numerous Kreton attacks.

It was discovered that the Kretons had used a wormhole to invade our region
of space from their home worlds.  And with that knowledge Earth called into
action Major Harrison Stryker, hero of WWIII, to travel back through the
worm hole and destroy the Kreton's home world headquarters.

With almost no chance of success, you accept the mission...

Major Stryker is the first Apogee game with "triple-parallax scrolling",
adding to the illusion of depth and danger.  Your mission is to pilot a
high-powered, armored space ship through dozens of stunning scenarios, such
as space stations, lava caves and alien cities.

Exciting features:
 ş Ad Lib music and Sound Blaster digitized effects.
 ş EGA/VGA high-speed animated graphics.
 ş Cinematic sequences.
 ş Unlike any other Apogee game yet.
 ş Full of bonuses and secrets to discover.
 ş Save and restore up to 10 games.
 ş Play with joystick or keyboard.
 ş Exciting demo mode.

If you're into action-filled, heart pounding shoot 'em ups, then Major Stryker
is your ticket to adventure.

Apogee enters the educational arena with a program that teaches spelling,
logic, word meanings and reading--yet is as compelling to play as our other
top games!

Built with a similar system that we used to create Duke Nukum, Word Rescue is
an incredible adventure for kids who want to rescue all the stolen words from
the mean ol' Gruzzles.  The Gruzzles can't read, and they don't want anyone
else to read.  So, they've stolen the words out of all of our books!

Benny Bookworm needs your help to stop the Gruzzles.  He needs you to reunite
the stolen words with their meanings.  Once you join all the words with their
pictures, Benny will put them back into the books.

This is an engrossing educational game with vivid EGA/VGA graphics and support
for Ad Lib and Sound Blaster.  Using the Duke Nukum graphical system, Word
Rescue has state-of-the-art dual-screen scrolling graphics similar to what's
seen on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis home gaming systems.  Even
"grown-ups" will like Word Rescue!

Word Rescue is designed for a range of players of all ages:
 Easy level:    Ages 4 - 7  (Even pre readers can play the game.)
 Medium level:  Ages 7 - 10
 Hard level:    Ages 10 and up  (A challenge for adults, too!)
 
Play as either a girl, or a boy!  You get to choose you which character you
wish to play, either male or female.  Either way, you'll visit amazing
locations on your word finding adventure.  As you hunt for all the missing
words you'll visit dark caves, rocky cliffs, deserts, happy towns, scary
haunted houses, funny factories, creepy dungeons, and many others.

 ş Finally, educational software that's fun to play!
 ş Three unique multi-level adventures, with 330 words to rescue.
 ş You choose whether to play a girl or a boy character.
 ş Learn reading, word spelling, word meanings, and logic solving.
 ş Incredible Duke Nukum-style dual-screen scrolling EGA/VGA graphics.
 ş Each of the three volumes features new graphics and puzzles.
 ş Fantastic Ad Lib and Sound Blaster music!
 ş Save/restore, joystick support, built-in help, high score list, etc.

                         $30 for all three episodes!

                 [This is the first Commander Keen series.]

Commander Keen is the first truly "commercial quality" game to be distributed
as shareware.  It features ultra high-speed smooth-scrolling EGA graphics and
superb sound effects.  The animation and scrolling is updated at nearly 40
frames per second, for comparison, motion picture quality cartoons are filmed
at only 24 frames per second.

 The story of Commander Keen is epic, and in the style of the memorable
matinee serials, like Flash Gordon.  You play the role of Billy Blaze, eight
year-old kid genius who builds an interstellar ship when not working at home
on his college fast-track degree.  Among other household objects, Billy uses
his Nintendo joystick for flight control and his mom's vacuum cleaner (heavily
modified) for his ship's ion propulsion system (with pile height adjustment).

At the hint of galactic trouble, Billy dons his brother's football helmet and
becomes "Commander Keen"Ädefender of Earth!  Ever on the side of justice,
fairness, and high calorie junk food, Keen dispenses justice with an iron
hand.

Keen's first adventure takes you to Mars, where the Vorticon invasion force
is planning their conquest of Earth.  While Keen is exploring Mars the
Vorticons steal pieces of his ship and hide them within their cities.  Can
Keen recover all the pieces and repel the Vorticon invasion?  You'll explore
many dangerous cities, packed with diabolical traps and hideous creatures,
both of Martian and Vorticon origin.  Use your pogo stick to reach high ledges
and jump deadly pits, and use your ray gun to stun the Vorticon invaders.  Can
you find the secret city?

"Marooned on Mars" is episode one of the Commander Keen trilogy.  Only part
one is available via shareware distribution, the other two episodes ("The
Earth Explodes" and "Keen Must Die!") may only be purchased from Apogee
Software Productions.

EACH VOLUME HAS COMPLETELY UNIQUE GRAPHICS AND ANIMATION!  Episode one is
located on the planet mars.  Episode two takes place on the immense Vorticon
mothership, where you'll need to stop the destruction of Earth by disabling
the eight deadly ray cannons aimed at Earth's greatest cities and wonders. 
Episode three takes Keen to the dangerous Vorticon home planet, where you'll
explore huge caves, battle the top Vorticon ninja fighters and discover the
secret of the Grand Intellect.

Commander Keen requires 520k free RAM to run.  Therefore if you have too many
RAM resident (TSR) programs you may have trouble running Commander Keen.  You
may use either a joystick or keyboard to play.  And, of course, an EGA- or
VGA-equipped system is required.  CGA is not supported.

SUPER KEEN FUN-PAK OFFER:

"Special Edition" episode, Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter) for $90, which averages

KEEN UPDATE:
Commander Keen has received nothing but rave reviews from national computer
magazines and players.  It is the first ever shareware game to rank number one
on the national top ten list as published by a member of the Association of
Shareware Professionals.  It was ranked number one for nine straight months
on the Shareware Top Ten chart!  And it was recently ranked "Editor's Choice"
by Shareware Magazine, along with Duke Nukum!

                 [This is the second Commander Keen series.]

Eight year old Kid genius, Billy Blaze, is in his backyard fort testing out
his newly built Photachyon Transceiver.  Simply put, it's an instantaneous
radio that can pick up signals anywhere in the galaxy.

In episode one, "Secret of the Oracle", Keen rockets to an alien planet to
rescue the Keepers of the Oracle, who are the only ones capable of helping
Keen find out more about the Shikadi.  Who are the Shikadi and why are they

Commander Keen: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter takes place right after Billy's
incredible adventure in Goodbye Galaxy (but only if he succeeds!).

It all begins when Billy Blaze's baby sitter is stolen by a mean bunch of
hungry aliens from the planet Fribbulus Xax.  She is going to be the main
course for dinner!  With your parents due home soon, how will you be able to
tell them, "The aliens ate my baby sitter!"?

Looks like a job for Commander Keen.  Armed with your neural-stunner and pogo
stick, you hop into your homemade starship and blast off to Fribbulus Xax to
the rescue.

Your galactic rescue mission will have you battling the dangerous aliens of
Fribbulus Xax, while collecting goodies to help you along the way.  Tons of
secret areas to discover, plus you'll need to find a way to get to the space
fortress orbiting high above the planet.

NOTE:  Over 2.5 Megs of graphics!!!
 
AD LIB MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS.  A full musical soundtrack accompanies Keen
on his alien adventure.  Also features three skill levels, gigantic scrolling
levels, ultra-smooth animation and screen effects, save/restore games,
joystick support, and much more!  When Billy gets bored, he can even play a
computer game on his specially built watch.

            A Top-Notch EGA/VGA Action/Adventure Scrolling Game.

You're agent 006«, top agent of the government's secret organization committed
to protecting the world against terrorists and power-mad criminals.

Your mission is to parachute into a high-security island outpost and secure
the plans to the ultimate satellite laser weapon, which was recently stolen
from the government.  In the wrong hands this weapon could mean world control
by the DVS, the world's most dangerous terrorist organization.

You will isolated from outside help as you parachute into the secret island
fortress of the DVS.  You will need to knock out the vast security system,
bypass dozens of extreme traps, overcome hundreds of multi-talented guards
(such as thugs, ninjas, sharp-shooters, knife throwers, sentries, dogs, and
many robots), and find the missing blue prints.  If possible, take out the
devious leader of the DVS (sorry, no file picture available).

If you liked Commander Keen or Duke Nukum, this game is just what you're
looking for.  Lots of great situations to overcome and traps to work around. 
This game has great puzzles which make it much more than a simple
run-jump-and-shoot contest.  Superb colorful graphics and scrolling levels.
James Bond never had it so tough!

Secret Agent is a full-screen scrolling game, where you sneak around a huge
map and enter various hideouts.  In each unique hideout you'll search for the
laser blue prints, dodge traps, solve puzzles, and blast the bad guys!  All
in good fun.  Save/restore, joystick support, EGA/VGA graphics, and much more.

Journey into an Aztec pyramid and survive the adventure of a lifetime! No
other game forces you to die in order to complete it!  That's just one of many
incredible plot twists in this excellent puzzle-oriented arcade/adventure game.

In Paganitzu you'll guide your character, Alabama Smith (Al), into a vast and
dangerous Aztec pyramid. Indiana Jones never had it so tough! Inside, you'll
confront traps of increasing perplexity, and creatures you never dreamed
existed.

All is rendered in brilliantly colorful EGA/VGA graphics and animation.  There
may be up to 50 animated objects at once on the screen!

This is a genuine adventure--not just a series of levels to conquer.  You can
follow different routes to achieve the winning goal.  In fact, you can finish
Paganitzu and still have missed many of the game's intriguing situations or
animated sequences.

Phenomenal animated sequences carry you through the entire pyramid and to a
dramatic conclusion.

In part one, "Romancing the Rose", Al discovers that the ancient Aztec
pyramid, known as "Paganitzu", holds many dark secrets.  Al inadvertently
releases a spirit of immense power, who's desire is to ravage the world.

Part two, "The Silver Dagger", finds Al exploring deeper into the Aztec ruin,
in search for clues to help halt the powerful force he's released. Al enters
a world of fiery devastation, filled with all new graphics and perils.  This
game has two huge animated sequences that are worth the price of admission in
themselves!

Finally, in part three, "Jewel of the Yucatan", Al discovers a horrifying
truth--the pyramid of Paganitzu is actually a living entity, which he could
not see as a living person!  Can Al still save the world?  Will he escape with
his life!  The chilling end awaits...?

Paganitzu is an innovative arcade game.  It tests your mind more than your
finger speed.  Each part has new puzzles, new graphics, and stunning story
surprises.  You won't be bored!

Exciting features:
 ş High-speed animation             ş Many full-screen images
 ş Dramatic animated sequences      ş Arcade quality sound effects
 ş Over 1 Meg of graphics.          ş Built-in hints
 ş Often hilarious game             ş Save and restore up to five games
 ş Many secret rooms and treasures

By the way:  "Paganitzu" is Aztec for "Temple of the Gods".

Enter an underground world of treasures and traps.  This colorful EGA game
rivals any commercial game with its arcade quality, puzzles and graphics.  As
Mylo Steamwitz, you'll enter cave after cave of adventure, gathering the
treasures of each, while evading hazards galore!  This game features the
smoothest animated graphics ever seen in an Apogee game.

The game begins with Mylo rocketing to the Altairian star system on a simple
treasure hunt.  But what happens is far more dangerous than even Mylo
bargained for.  He enters an underground world of chambers full of alien
technology and traps.  Strange alien creatures and robots inhabit the caves,
protecting the priceless crystals from money-greedy explorers.

Crystal Caves is a mixing of Nintendo's Mario Brothers, Commander Keen, and
Indiana Jones.  As with all Apogee games, a high priority has been placed on
solving ingenious puzzles built into the game.

Variety is also evident in Crystal Caves.  On some levels Mylo will even walk
up-side-down!  Other levels have such low gravity that the recoil from Mylo's
laser pistol can knock him into other dangers!  Some levels are without
lights, and others are packed full of falling hammers, egg-dropping alien
bats, free roaming slither eyes, web-shooting alien spiders, and much, much
more.  Each level has all new graphics!

Mylo is a lovable character who just wants to strike it rich!  Every get-rich
scheme he's tried has led to disaster, like when he sold Regulan Blood Stones
to the vampire dwellers of Ghoulbone IV.  It seems the vampires' teeth break
when they try to suck blood!  Now, with half the planet's vampire population
hunting him throughout the galaxy, Mylo is in search of more easy money...

There are three unique episodes to the Crystal Caves saga:  "The Trouble with
Twibbles", "Slugging it Out", and "Mylo Verses the Supernova".  Each episode
has a unique story twist and graphics.  Can you help Mylo strike it rich and
quit his day job?
