TWO VERSIONS:
1) First trilogy (three full episodes) for $35 (plus $4 shipping).

2) Get the first trilogy, plus a second trilogy for a total of $50 (plus $4
   shipping). In other words, for an extra $15 you can double the size of
   the game with a whole new set of levels!  (Bought separately, the second
   trilogy is $20.)  The second set of levels provides an entirely unique
   mission, with new level designs and new "boss" enemies to overcome.  You
   cannot play the second trilogy unless you have the first trilogy.  The
   first trilogy price ($35) includes the game engine that lets you also play
   the second, alternate trilogy, titled "The Nocturnal Missions".

NOTE:  When ordering Wolfenstein 3-D, please let us know if you can use
       HIGH-DENSITY disks, either 1.2meg or 1.44meg.

Wolfenstein 3-D is simply a technology breakthrough!  The first person
perspective 3-D gameplay you'll be viewing is the fastest of any PC game
game--much faster than that seen in Origin System's The Stygian Abyss!

Incredible Sound Blaster digitized sound effects are used throughout the game. 
Note:  The shareware version has just a limited sampling of digitized effects. 
To get ALL of the digitized effects, you must buy the full trilogy.  Sound
Blaster Pro owners will hear the digitized effects in STEREO!

The story:  You're William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the Allies' bad boy of
espionage and a terminal action seeker.  Your mission was to infiltrate the
Nazi fortress Castle Hollehammer and find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust,
the Nazi's blueprint for building the perfect army.  Rumors are that deep
within the castle the diabolical Dr. Schabbs has perfected a technique for
building a fierce army from the bodies of the dead.  It's so far removed from
reality that it would seem silly if it wasn't so sick.  But what if it were
true?

You were never given the chance to find out!  Captured in your attempt to grab
the secret plans, you were taken to the Nazi prison, Castle Wolfenstein, for
questioning and eventual execution.  Will you be able to escape and finish
your world-saving mission?

As an escaped prisoner in a Nazi war prison, you will move smoothly through
a 3-D world full of amazing detail and animation.  Unlike other 3-D games,
you'll move SMOOTHLY through a sensational and realistic 3-D environment, with
intelligent moving guards and opponents.

This is a high-action game.  Use your rapid fire machine gun to mow down a
line of enemies, or sneak up on a guard with your knife so you don't waste
your limited ammunition.  Id Software, the creators of Commander Keen, have
broken new ground with their all-new Wolfenstein 3-D.

So impressive is this game that several of the TOP retail game publishers
wanted to publish Wolfenstein 3-D commercially.  We're talking the
"biggies"--like Sierra Online, Electronic Arts, Origin Systems, and others!

˛ Intense and mood-setting Ad Lib music throughout the entire game.
˛ Incredible digitized effects for Sound Blaster and Disney Sound Source.
˛ Fastest 3-D VGA animated full-screen wide game available for IBM PC!
˛ Play with keyboard, joystick, mouse or Gravis GamePad.
˛ Save and restore games, plus quick-save and quick-load hot keys.
˛ Must be played on an 80286 or better machine.  Does not run on XT systems.

PARENTAL WARNING:  Wolfenstein 3-D, due to its intensely realistic visuals,
is recommended for children above 12 years of age.  For younger players we
recommend parental approval.  We have voluntarily rated this game PC-13,
(Profound Carnage!), which equates to violence seen in a PG-13 movie.

Ordering information for Wolfenstein 3-D is explained above.  Or read the
ORDER.FRM file.

                      APOGEE'S FIRST EDUCATIONAL GAME!

              $15 per episode, or $30 for all three episodes!

   (Site licenses available for learning institutions.  Call for Pricing.)

Apogee enters the educational arena with a program that teaches spelling,
logic, word meanings and reading--yet is as compelling to play as our other
top games!

Built with a similar system that we used to create Duke Nukum, Word Rescue is
an incredible adventure for kids who want to rescue all the stolen words from
the mean ol' Gruzzles.  The Gruzzles can't read, and they don't want anyone
else to read.  So, they've stolen the words out of all of our books!

Benny Bookworm needs your help to stop the Gruzzles.  He needs you to reunite
the stolen words with their meanings.  Once you join all the words with their
pictures, Benny will put them back into the books.

This is an engrossing educational game with vivid EGA/VGA graphics and support
for Ad Lib and Sound Blaster.  Using the Duke Nukum graphical system, Word
Rescue has state-of-the-art dual-screen scrolling graphics similar to what's
seen on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis home gaming systems.  Even
"grown-ups" will like Word Rescue!

Word Rescue is designed for a range of players of all ages:
 Easy level:    Ages 4 - 7  (Even pre readers can play the game.)
 Medium level:  Ages 7 - 10
 Hard level:    Ages 10 and up  (A challenge for adults, too!)
 
Play as either a girl, or a boy!  You get to choose you which character you
wish to play, either male or female.  Either way, you'll visit amazing
locations on your word finding adventure.  As you hunt for all the missing
words you'll visit dark caves, rocky cliffs, deserts, happy towns, scary
haunted houses, funny factories, creepy dungeons, and many others.

 ˛ Finally, educational software that's fun to play!
 ˛ Three unique multi-level adventures, with 330 words to rescue.
 ˛ You choose whether to play a girl or a boy character.
 ˛ Learn reading, word spelling, word meanings, and logic solving.
 ˛ Incredible Duke Nukum-style dual-screen scrolling EGA/VGA graphics.
 ˛ Each of the three volumes features new graphics and puzzles.
 ˛ Fantastic Ad Lib and Sound Blaster music!
 ˛ Save/restore, joystick support, built-in help, high score list, etc.

HOW TO ORDER:
There are three unique and challenging volumes of Word Rescue.  Each volume
of Word Rescue is $15, or you can order (and register) all three volumes for
just $30.  As an incentive to order all three volumes, you'll also get the
hints sheet, the cheat codes, and a new bonus game from Apogee.  Plus, you can
call the Word Rescue hints line for assistance.

                        $35 for all three episodes!

        *** NOTE:  Cosmo REQUIRES an 80286 or better system to run. *** 

What's green with red spots, has suction hands, and has an overbite like Bart
Simpson?  Of course, the answer is Cosmo!  A young alien on his way to visit
Disney World with his parents.  That is, until their ship is struck by a
blazing comet, forcing them to land on an uncharted planet.

While his Dad repairs the ship, Cosmo heads off to explore the strange planet. 
Upon returning, both his Mom and Dad are gone--and big, scary alien footprints
are all around his ship!  Oh no...has Cosmo's parents been taken away? 
Possibly to be eaten?!  Well, Cosmo is off to the rescue.

Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is an epic journey across a forbidden planet full of
dangers and surprises.  Can he save his parents in time?

Cosmo is a lovable extra-terrestrial (alien) with a special ability, he has
hands that work like suction cups!  He can cling to walls, ledges, and all
sorts of things.

No game in Apogee's history has displayed such amazing multi-scrolling
graphics technology, similar to games found on the Super Nintendo.  With
top-notch EGA/VGA animated graphics, huge animated creatures, and nearly two
megabytes of colorful graphics.

Amazing Features:
 ˛ Full-screen wide, dual-scrolling, EGA/VGA graphics (an IBM PC first!).
 ˛ Ad Lib music--with 19 theme songs!
 ˛ Over 20 unique and surprising creatures.
 ˛ Cosmo has many tricks, such as scaling walls with his suction hands.
 ˛ Massive levels, yet easy to explore.
 ˛ Self-running demonstration mode.
 ˛ Almost 2 MEG vivid EGA/VGA animated graphics.
 ˛ Joystick support, save/restore, built-in hints, and a lot more...

HOW TO ORDER:
Each Episode of Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is $20, or you can order (and
register) all three episodes for just $35.  As an incentive to order all three
episodes, you'll also receive a hint sheet, a cheat mode password, and a new
bonus game from Apogee.  Plus, you'll be able to call the Cosmo hints line or
mail questions to Apogee for assistance.  IMPORTANT:  Due to extreme animation
requirements, Cosmo will NOT run on 8088/8086 XT systems--you MUST have an
80286 or 80386/486+ to play this game!

                         $30 for all three episodes!

                 [This is the first Commander Keen series.]

Commander Keen is the first truly "commercial quality" game to be distributed
as shareware.  It features ultra high-speed smooth-scrolling EGA graphics and
superb sound effects.  The animation and scrolling is updated at nearly 40
frames per second, for comparison, motion picture quality cartoons are filmed
at only 24 frames per second.

 The story of Commander Keen is epic, and in the style of the memorable
matinee serials, like Flash Gordon.  You play the role of Billy Blaze, eight
year-old kid genius who builds an interstellar ship when not working at home
on his college fast-track degree.  Among other household objects, Billy uses
his Nintendo joystick for flight control and his mom's vacuum cleaner (heavily
modified) for his ship's ion propulsion system (with pile height adjustment).

At the hint of galactic trouble, Billy dons his brother's football helmet and
becomes "Commander Keen"ƒdefender of Earth!  Ever on the side of justice,
fairness, and high calorie junk food, Keen dispenses justice with an iron
hand.

Keen's first adventure takes you to Mars, where the Vorticon invasion force
is planning their conquest of Earth.  While Keen is exploring Mars the
Vorticons steal pieces of his ship and hide them within their cities.  Can
Keen recover all the pieces and repel the Vorticon invasion?  You'll explore
many dangerous cities, packed with diabolical traps and hideous creatures,
both of Martian and Vorticon origin.  Use your pogo stick to reach high ledges
and jump deadly pits, and use your ray gun to stun the Vorticon invaders.  Can
you find the secret city?

"Marooned on Mars" is episode one of the Commander Keen trilogy.  Only part
one is available via shareware distribution, the other two episodes ("The
Earth Explodes" and "Keen Must Die!") may only be purchased from Apogee
Software Productions.

EACH VOLUME HAS COMPLETELY UNIQUE GRAPHICS AND ANIMATION!  Episode one is
located on the planet mars.  Episode two takes place on the immense Vorticon
mothership, where you'll need to stop the destruction of Earth by disabling
the eight deadly ray cannons aimed at Earth's greatest cities and wonders. 
Episode three takes Keen to the dangerous Vorticon home planet, where you'll
explore huge caves, battle the top Vorticon ninja fighters and discover the
secret of the Grand Intellect.

Commander Keen requires 520k free RAM to run.  Therefore if you have too many
RAM resident (TSR) programs you may have trouble running Commander Keen.  You
may use either a joystick or keyboard to play.  And, of course, an EGA- or
VGA-equipped system is required.  CGA is not supported.

HOW TO ORDER:
Each Episode of Commander Keen is $15, or you can order (and register) all
three episodes for just $30.  As an incentive to order all three episodes,
you'll also receive a hint sheet, a cheat mode password, and a new bonus game
from Apogee.  Plus, you'll be able to call the Commander Keen hints line or
mail questions to Apogee for assistance.

SUPER KEEN FUN-PAK OFFER:
Order all six Keen games (including both episodes of Goodbye Galaxy, and the
"Special Edition" episode, Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter) for $90, which averages

Shareware Professionals.  It was ranked number one for nine straight months
on the Shareware Top Ten chart!  And it was recently ranked "Editor's Choice"

                 [This is the second Commander Keen series.]

Eight year old Kid genius, Billy Blaze, is in his backyard fort testing out
his newly built Photachyon Transceiver.  Simply put, it's an instantaneous
radio that can pick up signals anywhere in the galaxy.

While listening to an alien sitcom, "My Favorite Yorp", Billy hears a
disturbing message.  Bzzt...grdddz...oment of great triumph...ferrrt... ast
the Milky Way will be..zzz...terly destroyed...buzzt...can stop us now.  We
will remake...biipp...galaxy in the name...zzzzt...of the Gannalech.  Power
to the race!  Pow...rrp...to the Shikadi!...bizzp!  "So the Shikadi are
planning to destroy the galaxy, huh?", thinks Billy.  "Sounds like a job
for... Commander Keen!"

In episode one, "Secret of the Oracle", Keen rockets to an alien planet to
rescue the Keepers of the Oracle, who are the only ones capable of helping
Keen find out more about the Shikadi.  Who are the Shikadi and why are they
planning to use our Galaxy as target practice!

After completing the mission in episode one, Keen learns of the Shikadi's
enormous ship, which doubles as the largest weapon ever built.  So in episode
two, titled "The Armageddon Machine", Keen faces his greatest challenge
yet--to save the Galaxy!

Both episode one "Secret of the Oracle", and episode two "The Armageddon
Machine", are packed with exciting features, but episode two is a much bigger
game.  Exciting features include:

˛ Incredible smooth scrolling EGA/VGA graphics and animation.
˛ Titled perspective--gives all levels the appearance of depth & fullness.
˛ 1.6 Megs graphics for episode one, a lot more in episode two!
˛ Ad Lib soundtrack.  Episode one has 5 songs, episode two has 13 songs!
˛ 14 creatures in episode one, 20 all-new creatures in episode two.
˛ Three skill levels, which can add new creatures to the game!
˛ You can finally save ANYWHERE in the game, even inside levels.
˛ Amazing ending animated sequences.
˛ Star Wars-style text scrolling!
˛ Terminator-style opening sequence!
˛ Hundreds and hundreds of screens to explore, with HUGE levels.
˛ Keen has new abilities, such as hanging onto ledges and pulling himself up.
˛ Self-running demonstration mode.
˛ Joystick support.
˛ More fun than you can probably live with!

             Both EGA/VGA and separate CGA editions are available!

Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter is a SPECIAL EDITION of the Commander Keen series.
It is a single, high-powered, tremendously fun game that is larger than the
entire first trilogy combined!  (Hint:  This is a REALLY BIG game.)

Commander Keen: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter takes place right after Billy's
incredible adventure in Goodbye Galaxy (but only if he succeeds!).

It all begins when Billy Blaze's baby sitter is stolen by a mean bunch of
hungry aliens from the planet Fribbulus Xax.  She is going to be the main
course for dinner!  With your parents due home soon, how will you be able to
tell them, "The aliens ate my baby sitter!"?

Looks like a job for Commander Keen.  Armed with your neural-stunner and pogo
stick, you hop into your homemade starship and blast off to Fribbulus Xax to
the rescue.

Your galactic rescue mission will have you battling the dangerous aliens of
Fribbulus Xax, while collecting goodies to help you along the way.  Tons of
secret areas to discover, plus you'll need to find a way to get to the space
fortress orbiting high above the planet.

NOTE:  Over 2.5 Megs of graphics!!!
 
AD LIB MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS.  A full musical soundtrack accompanies Keen
on his alien adventure.  Also features three skill levels, gigantic scrolling
levels, ultra-smooth animation and screen effects, save/restore games,
joystick support, and much more!  When Billy gets bored, he can even play a
computer game on his specially built watch.

HOW TO ORDER:
Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter is sold separately for $35.  If you also order the
Goodbye Galaxy series (normally $35) you can get all three Keen games for only
$65--a five dollar savings.

RAM is also needed.

Apogee.  Plus, you'll be able to call the Duke Nukum hints line or mail
questions to Apogee for assistance.

DUKE NUKUM UPDATE:
Duke Nukum has grown to be as popular as Commander Keen.  It is was reviewed
in six major magazines, and is one of the hottest selling games of all time
as reported by several large shareware vendors.  It has been ranked "Editor's
Choice" by Shareware Magazine, along with Commander Keen.  Duke Nukum was also
voted "Staff Favorite" by the reviewers at PC Magazine.  In January of 1992
it grabbed the number one position on the Shareware Top Ten Chart, and has
been there to this day (April 1992).

As reported in Shareware Magazine: "This is their latest and greatest
arcade/adventure game and it's like nothing I've ever seen on an IBM PC...far
better than Nintendo, and rivals the Sega Genesis game system...the characters
are unique and entertaining."

            A Top-Notch EGA/VGA Action/Adventure Scrolling Game.

You're agent 006´, top agent of the government's secret organization committed
to protecting the world against terrorists and power-mad criminals.

Your mission is to parachute into a high-security island outpost and secure
the plans to the ultimate satellite laser weapon, which was recently stolen
from the government.  In the wrong hands this weapon could mean world control
by the DVS, the world's most dangerous terrorist organization.

You will isolated from outside help as you parachute into the secret island
fortress of the DVS.  You will need to knock out the vast security system,
bypass dozens of extreme traps, overcome hundreds of multi-talented guards
(such as thugs, ninjas, sharp-shooters, knife throwers, sentries, dogs, and
many robots), and find the missing blue prints.  If possible, take out the
devious leader of the DVS (sorry, no file picture available).

If you liked Commander Keen or Duke Nukum, this game is just what you're
looking for.  Lots of great situations to overcome and traps to work around. 
This game has great puzzles which make it much more than a simple
run-jump-and-shoot contest.  Superb colorful graphics and scrolling levels.
James Bond never had it so tough!

Secret Agent is a full-screen scrolling game, where you sneak around a huge
map and enter various hideouts.  In each unique hideout you'll search for the
laser blue prints, dodge traps, solve puzzles, and blast the bad guys!  All
in good fun.  Save/restore, joystick support, EGA/VGA graphics, and much more.

HOW TO ORDER:

There are three unique and challenging missions of Secret Agent.  Each mission
of Secret Agent is $15, or you can order (and register) all three missions for
just $30.  As an incentive to order all three missions, you'll also get the
hints sheet, the cheat codes, and a new bonus game from Apogee.  Plus, you'll
be able to call the Secret Agent hints line or mail questions to Apogee for
assistance.

             $15 per episode, or $30 for all three episodes!

Journey into an Aztec pyramid and survive the adventure of a lifetime! No
other game forces you to die in order to complete it!  That's just one of many
incredible plot twists in this excellent puzzle-oriented arcade/adventure
game.

In Paganitzu you'll guide your character, Alabama Smith (Al), into a vast and
dangerous Aztec pyramid. Indiana Jones never had it so tough! Inside, you'll
confront traps of increasing perplexity, and creatures you never dreamed
existed.

All is rendered in brilliantly colorful EGA/VGA graphics and animation.  The
CGA graphics mode is also supported for those without EGA or VGA systems, but
the CGA version is not nearly as spectacular as the EGA/VGA version!  There
may be up to 50 animated objects at once on the screen!

This is a genuine adventure--not just a series of levels to conquer.  You can
follow different routes to achieve the winning goal.  In fact, you can finish
Paganitzu and still have missed many of the game's intriguing situations or
animated sequences.

Phenomenal animated sequences carry you through the entire pyramid and to a
dramatic conclusion.

In part one, "Romancing the Rose", Al discovers that the ancient Aztec
pyramid, known as "Paganitzu", holds many dark secrets.  Al inadvertently
releases a spirit of immense power, who's desire is to ravage the world.

Part two, "The Silver Dagger", finds Al exploring deeper into the Aztec ruin,
in search for clues to help halt the powerful force he's released. Al enters
a world of fiery devastation, filled with all new graphics and perils.  This
game has two huge animated sequences that are worth the price of admission in
themselves!

Finally, in part three, "Jewel of the Yucatan", Al discovers a horrifying
truth--the pyramid of Paganitzu is actually a living entity, which he could
not see as a living person!  Can Al still save the world?  Will he escape with
his life!  The chilling end awaits...?

Paganitzu is an innovative arcade game.  It tests your mind more than your
finger speed.  Each part has new puzzles, new graphics, and stunning story
surprises.  You won't be bored!

Paganitzu is an EGA/VGA game, but a special CGA mode is also provided for
those without the better graphics card.  A joystick is optional.  Handy
built-in hints will help you learn how to play--while you play.

Exciting features:
 ˛ High-speed animation             ˛ Many full-screen images
 ˛ Dramatic animated sequences      ˛ Arcade quality sound effects
 ˛ Over 1 Meg of graphics.          ˛ Built-in hints
 ˛ Often hilarious game             ˛ Save and restore up to five games
 ˛ Many secret rooms and treasures

HOW TO ORDER:
Each episode of Paganitzu is $15, or you can order all three episode for just
$33 (includes $3 shipping).  As an incentive to order all three episodes,
you'll also receive a special "Hints and Tricks" sheet, a secret cheat mode,
and an all-new bonus game.

By the way:  "Paganitzu" is Aztec for "Temple of the Gods".

Enter an underground world of treasures and traps.  This colorful EGA game
rivals any commercial game with its arcade quality, puzzles and graphics.  As
Mylo Steamwitz, you'll enter cave after cave of adventure, gathering the
treasures of each, while evading hazards galore!  This game features the
smoothest animated graphics ever seen in an Apogee game.

The game begins with Mylo rocketing to the Altairian star system on a simple
treasure hunt.  But what happens is far more dangerous than even Mylo
bargained for.  He enters an underground world of chambers full of alien
technology and traps.  Strange alien creatures and robots inhabit the caves,
protecting the priceless crystals from money-greedy explorers.

Crystal Caves is a mixing of Nintendo's Mario Brothers, Commander Keen, and
Indiana Jones.  As with all Apogee games, a high priority has been placed on
solving ingenious puzzles built into the game.

Variety is also evident in Crystal Caves.  On some levels Mylo will even walk
up-side-down!  Other levels have such low gravity that the recoil from Mylo's
laser pistol can knock him into other dangers!  Some levels are without
lights, and others are packed full of falling hammers, egg-dropping alien
bats, free roaming slither eyes, web-shooting alien spiders, and much, much
more.  Each level has all new graphics!

Mylo is a lovable character who just wants to strike it rich!  Every get-rich
scheme he's tried has led to disaster, like when he sold Regulan Blood Stones
to the vampire dwellers of Ghoulbone IV.  It seems the vampires' teeth break
when they try to suck blood!  Now, with half the planet's vampire population
hunting him throughout the galaxy, Mylo is in search of more easy money...

There are three unique episodes to the Crystal Caves saga:  "The Trouble with
Twibbles", "Slugging it Out", and "Mylo Verses the Supernova".  Each episode
has a unique story twist and graphics.  Can you help Mylo strike it rich and
quit his day job?

HOW TO ORDER:
Each episode of Crystal Caves is $15, or you can order (and register) all
three episodes for just $30.  As an incentive to order all three episodes,
you'll also get the hints sheet, the cheat codes, and a new bonus game from
Apogee.  Plus, you'll be able to call the Crystal Caves hints line or mail
questions to Apogee for assistance.

CRYSTAL CAVES UPDATE:
In its second month of release Crystal Caves appeared on the Shareware Top Ten
Chart--faster than any previous Apogee game!  (And giving Apogee the First,
Second and Sixth positions in the Top Ten, as of January, 1992.)

Pharaoh's Tomb is an arcade/adventure game set in a huge Egyptian pyramid. 
You will need to explore and survive 20 uniquely dangerous levels (screens)
riddled with ingenious puzzles and traps.  This game uses a special animation
system called FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) which allows for
flicker free movement even on the older IBM PC's.

You will start with five lives and a few spears, which can be thrown at
offending denizens that guard the pyramid.  Moving walls, falling spikes,
bats, mummys, and magic winds are just some of the hazards to overcome.  On
each level you will need to collect one or more keys to advance to the next
level.  And hidden on the final level will be the prize of your journey.

This is the first of four volumes of Pharaoh's Tomb, subtitled "Raiders of 
the Lost Tomb"  The other three volumes are:  "Pharaoh's Curse", "Temple of
Terror", and "Nevada's Revenge!".  Each volume is $10, or order all four for 
just $25.  For registering you will get the newest versions, a hint sheet, and
the secret cheat code.

After months of searching and studying ancient maps, Nevada has stumbled upon
the location of a tremendous Viking treasure cave.  Join our intrepid hero as
he heads for the Arctic in this stunning and chilling new adventure series!

falling stalactites, runaway snowballs and even abominable snowmen!  There are
many, many more obstacles for Nevada to overcome in this highly adventurous
series.

Arctic Adventure is divided into four fully self-contained volumes, each
containing 20 unique levels to explore and overcome.  Each volume is $10, or

In the game, NASA has sent several manned missions to explore the mysterious
monuments...but every mission has ended in disaster.  Soon after the
astronauts landed on Mars NASA lost contact with them--and no one knows why.

You're the final hope.  You have been chosen for a special mission to rescue
the missing astronauts and to discover the secrets of the Martian monuments.
The game begins just after your ship lands on Mars near the site of the
"Cliff", one of the many monuments.  Will you suddenly vanish like the
astronaut explorers before you?  Can you find the entrance to each monument
and discover what secrets are hidden inside?

The Monuments of Mars! is an arcade/adventure game set in the near future as
you explore a secret underground city on Mars.  In the first volume ("First
Contact") you will need to survive 20 unique and challenging levels (screens)
filled with puzzles, traps, creatures and useful artifacts.

This game features great CGA graphics and sound effects, plus a compelling and
fascinating story.  Features include save/restore, high score chart, sound
on/off and keyboard configuration.

This is the first of four volumes of The Monuments of Mars!, subtitled "First
Contact".  The other three volumes are:  "The Pyramid", "The Fortress", and
"The Face".  Each volume is $10, or order all four for just $25.  For
registering you will get the newest versions, a hint sheet, and the special

You're Major Harrison Stryker, the top pilot in the government's Aerospace
Secret Technology and Research Organization (ASTRO).  You've just been
summoned to an emergencey meeting:  It appears that Earth's superheroes,
Commander Keen, Duke Nukum and Snake Logan (star of Bio Hazard), have been
kidnapped.  Little else is known.

Except that Commander Keen, while being captured, must have had a chance to
activate the homing signal on his computer wrist watch.  The signal is coming
from deep space.  You must set out on a suicidal mission to save Keen, and
find out who's behind this diabolical plot.

Major Stryker will be Apogee's first triple-scrolling playfield game!  Packed
full of high-speed animated action galore, as you guide your ship through
dozens of intense battles over planets, asteroids, and massive star ships.
