Our best adventure game requires an entire 360K disk!  Has as many features as
even the best commercial adventure games, and then some.  Like a 16-color
screen, ASCII graphics (that even work on nongraphic systems), 1000+ word
dictionary, over 160 game locations, scores of sound effects, a "hint"
command, and more.

You begin on a remote mining planet with just your battered space ship and the
hope that one day you'll have a job that actually pays!  After an amazing
discover you begin a trek that spans four planets, including a huge planetship.
All to save a civilization from utter extinction--from a star ready to explode! 

"Better than any adventure by Infocom."           -- George Brossard, TX

It's a text adventure game that mixes elements of science fiction, action,
fantasy and rollicking adventure.  The story begins with you standing aboard
the Titanic just seconds before the ship sinks!  In this story of riveting 
survival you'll discover a long forgotten undersea mystery, travel to the
Earth's future, fly a shuttle to a floating city and be chased by a slobbering,
three-armed creature--and that's just the believable part!

"...as sophisticated as the best commercial adventure games by Infocom."

We've been working--unsuccessfully--on this area for a year now.  Can we buy

T.V. Guide magazine called Star Trek "...the most popular TV series of all
time."  Now we challenge your knowlegde of the award winning show with a
series of 10 Star Trek trivia games.  Each volume has 100 multiple choice 
questions, and when you answer a question correctly you'll be rewarded with
a "Bonus Fact".  Bonus Facts are additional tidbits that even further expand
your Star Trek knowledge.

What type of crystal is used to power the engines of the Enterprise?  What
is Mr. Spock's first name?  How fast is warp 2?  What does the Prime 
Directive prevent the crew of the Enterprise from doing?

Did you know that Dr. McCoy's medical instruments were actually modified
salt and pepper shakers.  Or that it was Leonard Nemoy who developed the
idea of Mr. Spock's Vulcan nerve pinch (so as to make Spock less violent).
Or that the Enterprise is 947 feet long.  Or that Joan Collins, Terri Garr,
and Ricardo Montalban all appeared in a Star Trek episode. Or...

It's all in Trek Trivia.  Order all 10 volumes ($40) and we'll also include
a FREE MYSTERY GAME as a bonus.

"I'm a Star Trek fan and these trivia games answer my prayers, thank you!"

บ FUN-PAKS บ                                    $10 each (four games on a disk)
ศออออออออออผ
A new idea.  We've taken the best programs submitted to us by outside game
authors and combined them into categories, 4 per disk.  None of these games
have ever been released anywhere else before.  They are not public domain, nor
are they shareware.  They're originals, and for the minimal price, they're a
bargain, too.  Currently, we have two FUN-PAKS:


                        ADVENTURE FUN-PAK 
                        อออออออออออออออออ   
                         * ROGUE RUNNER
                         * NIGHT BOMBER
                         * RAIDERS OF THE FORBIDDEN MINE
                         * THE THING


                         PUZZLE FUN-PAK
                         ออออออออออออออ
                         * PHRASE MASTER
                         * BLOCK FIVE
                         * MAZE MACHINE
                         * ASTEROID RESCUE



Rumors:  A new KROZ trilogy is in the works.  SUPER KROZ will have many new
features and improvements.  A TRIVIA FUN-PAK is also close to completion.

Apogee Software Productions is always looking for the best new software.  If
you think you have a program or game that qualifies send it in to our
Review Dept.  Send only completed projects please--bug free, too.

In the meantime have fun and good luck.

Sincerely,

Scott Miller
President
