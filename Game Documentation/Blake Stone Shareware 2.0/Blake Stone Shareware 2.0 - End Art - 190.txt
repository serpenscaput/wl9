The facts bear out. I will not theorize or, in Blake's words, chatter, unless relevant 
to this inquiry.
^EP
The known universe is growing rapidly. Recent Directorate colonization is expanding 
the borders of the planetary system--almost beyond effective control. There are equal 
and unlimited opportunities for good or for evil.  In that vein, for it is relevant 
to Blake's motivation, I will continue.

Robert Wills Stone III was born in Old London, England, Earth on July 2, 2114. The 
first born of twin children to Elizabeth Anderson Stone and Robert Wills Stone II 
(deceased); he was nicknamed Blake, to avoid an obvious confusion.
^EP
^AY06^SH033 ^AYfa^LMfff^LJAt 18, upon Blake's final university year, a bomb ripped 
through a transit shuttle outside the family's summer home^CE in New South Wales.^DM 
The debris showered the walk with blasted alloy and injured hundreds of bystanders. 
Fortunately for Robert Wills Stone II, death was instantaneous. Elizabeth Stone was 
not as fortunate. Physically and emotionally scarred, she has been under the care 
of Blake's sister, Sara Elizabeth Stone.
^EP
Mrs. Stone and Sara reside on Selon, a terra-^CEformed planetoid at the far edge 
of the Sol system asteroid belt. In the time since the family tragedy, Sara has been 
intensely studying the roots of evil which she believes underlie all human behavior. 
Her career: Research; Genetics. But as Blake would say, "Bloody chatter!! REBA; get 
back to the inquiry!"

^AXfc^AY04^SH02e^LMfff^LJSimilarly motivated and with an equal share of the Stone 
determination, Blake chose a career in the British Royal Navy. At age 22, he led 
forces in Operation: New London, a fierce struggle to reclaim that outpost colony. 
The battle cost few of his force's lives. The rebels were destroyed.^DM
Blake was awarded the Kindrey Medal^AX05^AYfd^SH02c^CE^AY03 of Honor and promoted 
to the position^CE of Special Operations Commander.
^EP
Following the New London conflict, there have been numerous battles. In each campaign, 
Blake Stone was successful. It was his exemplary record which caught the eye of His 
Majesty and the King's council. Public archives record that, after eight years of 
heroic^AX15^SH02a service and at the age of 26,^CE Robert Wills Stone III would^CE 
retire from the Royal Navy.^DM^CE Public archives, however, do not^CE record that 
he entered British^CE Intelligence as Agent Blake Stone.

^AXfb^AYf8^SH02b ^AY04^LMfff^LJOnly sparse records can be gleaned from Selon or the 
STAR Institute. The planetoid is outside Directorate sphere of influence.  I find 
references to a Dr. Pyrus W.^DM Goldfire, the STAR Director. It would appear data-bank 
information for this individual has^CE been altered or amended. I find no record 
of^CE his birth. I find no reference to living relatives.

These files appear to be altered, as well. Among the data which I am able to restore: 
a reference to his Associate Genetic Professorship at Corel University. His contract 
was terminated 18 January, 2130, due in part to a dispute over the ownership and 
licensing of a genetic research discovery. Data restoration fails to provide additional 
information.
^EP
However, many personal log entries exist. The journal appears to grow increasingly 
irrational, and is punctuated with outbursts of paranoid ranting--fits of 'chatter'. 
The most recent entry is specifically directed at the Agent and refers to him...by 
nickname. (?)(data flag)

^AXfa^AYfb^SH028 ^LMfff^LJ23 September, 2140: "The Directorate is sending Stone. 
The assistance of their best operative? Ha! You can't conceive, in your wildest dreams, 
what I have accomplished! Blake, I'll have a few surprises for you! I'll show you, 
Blake; then I will show the galaxy..."^DM
^EP
The log continues, but I believe you get the gist of the...chatter?

Assessment: Goldfire is planning Agent Stone's demise. It would seem the Doctor has 
an evil prescription for the planetary system, as well. Blake Stone is en route to 
the STAR Institute.

Data is insufficient to make further assessments regarding this inquiry.
