                          ============================
                          BEFORE INSTALLING THIS PATCH
                          ============================

The operation of this patch file is fairly straightforward.  There are only a
few operations that you need to follow.

 þ Your copy of Blake Stone v2.0 is currently installed.  This patch file will
   do nothing if you do not currently have your game installed.  If you do not,
   you should make sure your registered copy is on your hard drive before
   beginning the patch procedure.  If you only have Blake Stone v1.0, this
   patch will do nothing for you; you will have to obtain the patch that will
   convert v1.0 into v2.0 before applying this patch for v2.1.  The filename
   for the patch from v1.0 to v2.0 is BSPATCH6.ZIP.

 þ It is VITAL that you install the patch to exactly the same directory as the
   registered copy is installed it.  It is strongly recommended that this patch
   either be installed from a floppy disk, or from a subdirectory on your hard
   drive that has nothing else in it besides these installation files.

 þ To patch your copy of Blake Stone, you need to change to the drive and
   directory that the patch files reside in and enter "INSTALL".

 þ When the patch is finished running, it will delete itself, so you don't need
   to worry about deleting the patch program and it's data file.

 þ Your configuration file, and any save games you may have had with v2.0 of
   Blake Stone are incompatible with v2.1 of Blake Stone.  If these exist in
   your game directory, they will be deleted by the patch program.

 þ If you have only the shareware episode, this patch will do nothing for you,
   since this patch requires a registered copy of the game.

 þ Apogee has discontinued the Episode 1-3 version of Blake Stone.  If you
   have this version, or know someone who does, please contact Apogee on how
   to obtain upgrade assistance.  Contact information as at the bottom of your
   document.  If you are a registered owner, PLEASE include your order number
   which came from the invoice when you received your software in all contact
   with Apogee Software regarding your order.


                                ===============
                                HAVING TROUBLE?
                                ===============

If you experience trouble, you should follow these steps to correct the
problem you are experiencing.

  þ Remove all copies of Blake Stone from your computer, including these
    patch files.

  þ Install v2.0 from your original diskettes from Apogee.  If you only have
    v1.0, install that, and then run the patch to make it v2.0 before
    installing this v2.1 patch.

  þ Unpack the patch files to a different directory on your computer.

  þ Change to the directory you've unpacked the patch files to, and run
    the install program there (INSTALL.EXE).
