To view the exciting Blake Stone screen previews, just type
'BLAKE'.  By running the viewer, you'll be able to get a glimpse
of one of the most amazing shareware games yet released.

Shareware's newest game design stars, JAM PRODUCTIONS, will release
an unbelievable action game, "BLAKE STONE: Aliens Of Gold", during
or before July 1993!  This action-adventure will be distributed by
the shareware game giant, Apogee Software.

In this futuristic game, you play the part of British agent, Blake
Stone.  The overall story pits you against the intelligent but
demented Dr. Goldstern, his henchmen, and his evil genetic
experiments.  Luckily, British intelligence has scientist-
informants to help you out on your quest to stop Goldstern's evil
plans.

You're first mission is to secretly explore one of Dr. Goldstern's
"Space Technology And Research" (STAR) buildings -- namely, the
earth-based STAR Institute.  Strange things have been reported
there--something about genetic, alien research.  British
intelligence doesn't know much about what goes on inside the STAR
Institute, it's your job is to find out!

The Aliens Of Gold game design features include:

* RE-ENTRYABLE LEVELS:  Each mission takes place in a multi-story
building of at least ten different floors.  These floors may be
traversed in any order and may be re-entered at any time.  For
example, some floors contain materials needed on floors you may
have already partly explored.  This makes for a multitude of
different ways in which each mission could be played.  This 're-
entry' technique turns what would normally be ten individual levels
into ONE HUGE LEVEL!

* SMART ACTORS:  Smart actors will look at their surroundings,
'think' about the situation, and act accordingly.  For instance,
when a scientist runs out of ammo, he'll look around and pick more
up if it's available (possibly before YOU can reach it!).  If none
can be found, he'll look for a door and try to run out of the room
before you can shoot him.  Smart actors perform a similar action
when their health is low.  Smart actors make game play more
exciting because both YOU and THEY are fighting for health and the
same ammo!

* SPACE FLIGHT SCENARIO:  These levels remove you from the standard
in-the-building atmosphere and take you to a space flight scenario.
Here, you battle Dr. Goldstern's henchmen while guiding a shuttle
craft through a star-laden asteroid field. The shuttle craft has
forward and reverse thrusters and a 360 degree rotating canopy for
multi-directional shooting.  Two recoil-guns mounted on the front
of the ship allow a massive arsenal to be projected at your
enemies!

* INTERACTIVE ACTORS:  In general, the scientists are 'nice guys';
that is, they don't start out as your adversaries.  They quietly
roam around the buildings doing their jobs.  It's your decision
whether or not to interrogate a scientist.  If he's an informant,
you get a clue or his ammo.  Then again, you might get a stomach
full of lead!  Scientists will also start shooting when they sense
something is wrong; say, a dead body on the floor or another actor
shooting.

* INTERACTIVE OBJECTS:  Specific wall sections are designed for
interacting with the player.  (These are new to Blake Stone, are
have no parallels in Wolfenstein 3-D.)

 -- CONCESSION MACHINES are used to get food, drinks, or a clue.
The food and drinks will increase the player's health.

 -- COMPUTER TERMINALS, when activated, give you access to
Goldstern's computer information network (CIN).  This network is
able to control certain elements in the game, for instance,
disabling ceiling-mounted turrets.  Many other things can be
controlled and VIEWED by using this network--it'll be up to you to
discover what they are, and how they can aid you!

 -- ELEVATOR BUTTONS:  A panel is used to move around the different
floors in each building.  Simply select a number and you're on your
way; that is, unless the floor is locked.  Locked floors require a
code to be entered first.  But, surely some nice scientist
(informant) could help you out with these codes.

* PLASMA BARRIERS:  These electronic gates are controlled by
switches located throughout each complex.  Switches can be
connected to plasma barriers located on the same floor or on a
different floor.  You must be careful when moving around ACTIVE
plasma barriers because their powerful forces will harm you when
touched.

* ENHANCED ACTOR ANIMATIONS:  Many actors were created with
extensive animated frames.  Some of these creatures include:

 -- Mutants that rise from gurneys for their ensuing chase!
 -- POD aliens that break out of their indestructible pods! 
 -- Electro-Aliens that emerge from wall-mounted sockets!
 -- Liquid aliens that flow toward you, then rise to attack!
 -- Contained creatures that burst out from locked canisters!
 -- ...and a lot MORE!

(Plus all actors have must-see death cinematics.)

* OTHER COOL STUFF:  Many other things have been added to make game
play exciting, fun, and just plain different! Some of these
include:

 -- Crates can be blown apart to reveal weapons and other goodies!
 -- One-way doors (once you go in, you must find another way out!)
 -- Direct Level Transport (DLT) warps you to secret levels!
 -- Electrically-linked doors (multiple doors open at once!)
 -- VMT units that explode when shot (chain reaction explosions!)
 -- Lots of goodies (gold, money bags, food, ammo, etc.)
 -- Over 20 unique actors (guards, aliens, mutants, pods, etc!)
 -- Internal scenarios (hi-tech buildings, space station, moonbase)
 -- Five futuristic weapons (with silent-shot and grenades!)
 -- AdLib/SB support (FM and digitized sound effects!  [IN STEREO])
 -- Over 15 musical scores (action-oriented -- never dull!)
 -- Animated, musical, text presentation system (coolest HELP!)
 -- 60 PRIMARY levels PLUS secret levels!
 -- Over 3.5 MB of high-speed 256-color animated VGA graphics!
 -- ...and much, MUCH MORE!

* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  This game requires the following MINIMUM
system configuration:

 -- 20 MHZ 286
 -- 6 MB of hard drive space
 -- VGA graphics card
 -- Optional:  mouse, joystick, sound cards
