The facts bear out. I will not theorize or, in Blake's words, chatter, unless relevant 
to this inquiry.
^EP
The known universe was growing rapidly. Directorate colonization was expanding the 
borders of the planetary system--almost beyond effective control. There was equal 
and unlimited opportunities for good or for evil.  In that vein, for it is relevant 
to Blake's motivation, I will continue.

Robert Wills Stone III was born in Old London, England, Earth on July 2, 2114. The 
first born of twin children to Elizabeth Anderson Stone and Robert Wills Stone II 
(deceased); he was nicknamed Blake, to avoid an obvious confusion.
^EP
^AY06^SH033 ^AYfa^LMfff^LJAt 18, upon Blake's final university year, a bomb ripped 
through a transit shuttle outside the family's summer home^CE in New South Wales.^DM 
The debris showered the walk with blasted alloy and injured hundreds of bystanders. 
Fortunately for Robert Wills Stone II, death was instantaneous. Elizabeth Stone was 
not as fortunate. Physically and emotionally scarred, she has been under the care 
of Blake's sister, Sara Elizabeth Stone.
^EP
Mrs. Stone and Sara reside on Selon, a terra-^CEformed planetoid at the far edge 
of the Sol system asteroid belt. In the time since the family tragedy, Sara has been 
intensely studying the roots of evil which she believes underlie all human behavior. 
Her career: Research; Genetics. But as Blake would say, "Bloody chatter!! REBA; get 
back to the inquiry!"
       ^AY08^SH034
^EP
^AXfc^AY04^SH02e^LMfff^LJSimilarly motivated and with an equal share of the Stone 
determination, Blake chose a career in the British Royal Navy. At age 22, he led 
forces in Operation: New London, a fierce struggle to reclaim that outpost colony. 
The battle cost few of his force's lives. The rebels were destroyed.^DM
Blake was awarded the Kindrey Medal^AX05^AYfd^SH02c^CE^AY03 of Honor and promoted 
to the position^CE of Special Operations Commander.
^EP
Following the New London conflict, there have been numerous battles. In each campaign, 
Blake Stone was successful. It was his exemplary record which caught the eye of His 
Majesty and the King's council. Public archives record that, after eight years of 
heroic^AX15^SH02a service and at the age of 26,^CE Robert Wills Stone III would^CE 
retire from the Royal Navy.^DM^CE Public archives, however, do not^CE record that 
he entered British^CE Intelligence as Agent Blake Stone.

^AXfb^AYf8^SH02b ^AY04^LMfff^LJOnly sparse records can be gleaned from Selon or the 
STAR Institute. The planetoid is outside Directorate sphere of influence.  I find 
many references to a Dr. Pyrus W.^DM Goldfire, the STAR Director. It would appear 
the data-bank information for this individual has^CE been altered or amended. I find 
no record of^CE his birth. I find no reference to living relatives.

These files appear to be altered, as well. Among the data which I am able to restore: 
a brief reference to his Associate Genetic Professorship at Corel University. His 
contract was terminated 18 January, 2130, due in part to a dispute over the ownership 
and licensing of a genetic research discovery. Data restoration fails to provide 
additional information.
^EP
However, many personal log entries exist. The journal appears to grow increasingly 
irrational, and is punctuated with outbursts of paranoid ranting--fits of 'chatter'. 
The most recent entry is specifically directed at the Agent and refers to him...by 
nickname. (?)(data flag)
^EP
(Replay log #gold54.ses)

^AXfa^AYfb^SH028 ^LMfff^LJ23 September, 2140: "The Directorate is sending Stone. 
The assistance of their best operative? Ha! You can't conceive, in your wildest dreams, 
what I have accomplished! Blake, I'll have a few surprises for you! I'll show you, 
Blake; then I will show the galaxy..."^DM
^EP
The log continues, but I believe you get the gist of the...chatter?

Assessment: Goldfire was planning Agent Stone's demise. It would seem the Doctor 
had an evil prescription for the planetary system, as well. Blake Stone travelled 
to the STAR Institute.

Data is insufficient to make further assessments regarding this inquiry.

Search on Stone, Blake W. shows a successful halt on Dr. Pyrus Goldfire's activities 
to threaten and eventually rule the known universe.
^EP
^AY05^SH0db  ^LMfff^LJAgent Blake Stone carried out a top secret British Intelligence 
plan to destroy the many bio-labs and research complexes that Goldfire used to create 
and perfect his "mutants of destruction".^DM

REBA ...accessing...

Although the mission was successful in destroying the machines of war, Dr. Goldfire 
was able to elude capture.
^EP
^AY05Historical archives show that from 2141 to 2145, the Directorate initiated widespread 
deep galactic probes to locate Goldfire after his escape - with no success.

          ^SH0dd

^EP
^AY0a^SH0e0 ^LMfff^LJ^AY05Related data indicates that agent Stone was debriefed of 
classified intelligence by British officials, and was re-assigned to other duties 
in the sector. He has not been involved with the Goldfire case since that time. (idle)^DM

^AYfc^SH0da  ^LMfff^LJ^AY04Data shows a Directorate High Command communication to 
British Intelligence regarding the recent transmission from an undercover^DM agent 
team stationed on the planet of Selon. The coded message, received three days ago 
and dated 02-14-2149, reported unusual activity at an abandoned STAR Institute training 
facility.
^EP
The team detected cloaked transports able to slip through the plantary ID beacon 
grid, and land at the training grounds. The report stated that the agents were also 
able to watch the ships as they materialized.  Markings on the hull exteriors indicated 
that Dr. Pyrus Goldfire might be back in business on Selon.

Agent Stone has been re-assigned to the Goldfire case. His orders for project: Planet 
Strike, are to travel to Selon and ascertain if Dr. Goldfire is indeed on the planet, 
and if so to destroy the doctor once and for all.

Latest data confirms Agent Stone is en route to Selon to rendevouz with the agents 
and then proceed to the training facility. (idle)
