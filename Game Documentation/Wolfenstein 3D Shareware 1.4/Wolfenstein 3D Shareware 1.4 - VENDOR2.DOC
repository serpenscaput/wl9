BY COPYING, USING OR DISTRIBUTING THIS SHAREWARE PROGRAM, YOU
INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS vendor.doc.

=====================
KEY POINTS
=====================

[*] Everyone can -- and is encouraged! -- to copy, upload and
    generally pass around this Program without charging for it.

[*] If you want to distribute it in a retail location (such as
    on a rack), or as part of a hardware or software bundle, or
    on CD-ROM you must get PRIOR signed written permission from
    Apogee.  Apogee reserves its right to withhold permission.

[*] If you want to distribute it as provided in this Vendor.doc
    by catalog, advertisement, BBS, on-line service, or direct
    mail, no written permission is needed.  Apogee highly
    recommends, however, that distribution be made from a copy
    from Apogee or from one of its authorized sources, such as
    our web site (http://www.apogee1.com) to prevent the sale 
    of older versions.

[*] All advertising of the Program must include "Apogee" in the
    description.

[*] The Program is marked "Shareware" and contains "episode #1". 
    No right is given by this Vendor.Doc to copy, use or
    distribute any other version, including any version that is
    registered, or not marked shareware, or that contains any
    episode other than #1.

  [2] No copyright or trademark information may be removed.

  [3] You must not [a] distribute any version of the Program
      with unauthorized changes, such as additional or different
      levels, or changed characters or mazes; or
      [b] characterize such versions as an "add-on" or
      "extension" of any Apogee product; or [c] distribute any
      unauthorized third party utility designed to alter any
      Apogee game, game level, game episode or saved game.

 [B] ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS IF YOU CHARGE:  If your distribution
involves a disk or other physical medium, you must also:

  [1] Clearly market the Program as shareware, which requires
      (among other things) using "try before you buy" or similar
      words on packaging for the Programs.

  [2] Include "Apogee" and the "comet" logo (we encourage use of
      the 4 color version) on the front cover of the package.

  [3] Include the your name, address and phone number on the
      packaging and in any added documentation.  This can be
      imprinted on the package or may be in the form of a label
      affixed to the box, carton or folder. 

  [4] Any description of the Program included in a re-sellers
      catalog, sales brochure, on special packaging or handouts,
      must include "An Apogee Game", "Released by Apogee" or
      "Published by Apogee" if the word count of the description
      is more than 14 words in length.

  [5] Distribute copies only after the programs on newly created
      master diskettes have been thoroughly tested.  Always use
      high quality media and duplication technology.

  [6] Try to sell only the most current version of the Program.

  [7] Although Apogee discourages the practice, you may add an
      installation routine if it does not interfere with the
      proper operation or installation of the Program.

  [8] Program updates, recommended descriptions and "screen
      shots" will be provided upon request, and are available in
      the re-seller / dealer conference of Apogee's main BBS.

 [C] ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR BUNDLES, CD-ROMS, AND RACKS: If
you wish to distribute in a retail location (such as on a rack),
or as part of a hardware or software bundle, or on CD-ROM, you
must get PRIOR signed written permission from Apogee, which is
in Apogee's discretion and may be subject to royalty or other
conditions.

[4] TERM:  Unless terminated for cause, your grants under this
VENDOR.DOC terminate 30 days after you receive written notice,
or such longer period as the notice may provide.  Following such
termination, you may distribute the Program only until the
earlier of 60 days after the termination date in the notice, or
distribution of the copies you have in stock.  Sections [2],
[5], and [6] survive termination.

[5] LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF REMEDIES: If Apogee
provides a physically defective copy of the Program, Apogee will
replace it upon submission of the defective one.  Aside from
this, the Program IS PROVIDED "AS-IS", AND NO WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND (INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE AS TO IT
OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON.  OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS SUCH REPLACEMENT, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WILL WE PROVIDE ANY OTHER REMEDY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING
FROM IT, INCLUDING SUCH FROM NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, EVEN AFTER NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

[6] MISCELLANY

 [A] Since we would be irreparably damaged if Section [3], [4]
or [6][D] were not specifically enforced, we will be entitled
without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate
equitable remedies with respect to breaches of such sections, in
addition to such other remedies as we may have.

 [B] You will hold us, our partners, contractors, employees and
agents harmless from damage, loss and expense arising directly
or indirectly from your acts and omissions in copying and
distributing the Program, including from any installation
routine that you may add.

 [C] With respect to every matter arising under this, you
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and
federal courts sitting in Dallas, Texas, and to service by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or as otherwise
permitted by law.

reverse engineer the Program, or use or disclose any
confidential information that it contains.
