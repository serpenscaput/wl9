CORRIDOR 8: GALACTIC WARS

ADDITIONAL NOTES

All controls will be configured from within the game.  This includes sound card configuration. 
 For example, to configure your keyboard you simply go the controls menu option, 
select which action you want to change then press the new key for that action.  Also, 
VR Helmets and special controllers will be turned on/off from within the game rather 
than using a seperate setup utility or command line to do this.

The advantages to doing this are:

•	No setup utility is needed!! (this saves coding time)
•	Reduces the number of files in the directory.
•	One executable (the game) does EVERYTHING!
•	Makes playing it directly off the CDROM possible (no setup file to read)
