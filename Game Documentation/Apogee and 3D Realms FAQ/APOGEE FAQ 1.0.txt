There!  The first official version of the Official Apogee FAQ is posted!
This version contains a COMPLETE guide to cheats for Apogee games.  It's
got ALL the cheats, debugmodes, etc, in ALL of Apogee's currently released
games!  Changes from version 0.3 of the FAQ are noted by } marks preceding
each changed line.  (At least I _think_ I marked all new changes.)  There
are also some other new sections, such as a "split file" section, a note
about "3D Realms", etc.  Release dates on upcoming games have been updated.
And more.

[1.4]  What is Apogee?

Apogee is a games distributor for PC games of many sorts.  It is a diverse
gaming company, contributing to several different genres of games.  While
much of what Apogee publishes are games written primarily by other companies,
such as Cygnus or Argo, Apogee writes their own games as well.  Apogee's staff
includes an array of talented programmers, artists, and musicians.  For many
years now, Apogee has been among the leading shareware games companies for the
PC and compatible market.

}[1.5]  What was "Apogee" mean?
}
}According to the American Heritage dictionary, "apogee" means:  "the point
}in the orbit of the moon or of an artificial satellite most distant from
}the earth."  Or, more generally, "the farthest or highest point; apex."
}Related words are the Greek "apogaion," the neuter form of "apogaios"
}which means "away from the earth."  There is also the New Latin word
}"apogaeum," which is derived from the Greek word.  There is a French word
}"Apogee" (with an accent over the first 'e').  In English, there is the
}related word "apogean" and the antonym "perigee."
}
}All this is academic, however, for according to Joe Siegler, "Apogee means
}action."  :-)

[1.6]  How Apogee markets its games

In 1987, Apogee came up with a unique method of marketing their games.  Since
then, other shareware companies have adopted their strategy.  Their scheme is
this:  each game they produce is divided into three to four, sometimes even
six, episodes.  The first episode is free.  It can be downloaded from
CompuServe, BBS's, or the Internet, or bought in a store that distributes
shareware games for disk copying charges.  You can distribute the shareware
episode to your friends yourself, if you like, provided you leave all the
original files intact.

If you like the shareware episode of a game, Apogee requires that you register
it.  This is the normal rule regarding shareware.  Upon registration, you will
receive the complete game.

Apogee uses this marketing scheme so that people can have a good idea about
the game they are buying before they put their cash on the line.

[1.7]  Apogee's internet mailing list

Apogee has an Internet mailing list.  Whenever new games or slide shows are
released (or other important information), Apogee sends the information out in
a mailing.  If you would like to be on this mailing list, contact Joe Siegler
<joe.s... (at) swcbbs.com> to sign up.  It is free of charge.

}[2.1]  What is Apogee's relationship with 3D Realms?
}
}Apogee and 3D Realms are sister companies, both divisions of Action
}Entertainment, Inc.  Originally, Action Entertainment's next-generation
}of 3D games were going to be published under the Apogee name.  However,
}in late August of 1994, 3D Realms was born, and the four next-generation
}3D games that Action had under production will be published under the
}3D Realms name.  This does not include "Blake Stone: Planet Strike" or
}"Rise of the Triad"; both of these games will be published under the
}Apogee name.

[2.2]  What is Apogee's relationship with id?

Apogee Software and id Software are completely different companies.  I believe
most of the id guys are former employees of Softdisk, who decided to do their
own thing.  They wrote the legendary Commander Keen series and Wolfenstein
3-D, which were *distributed* by Apogee.  So if you play these games, you will
see both Apogee's and id's labels.

Then, id wrote Doom.  They decided to publish this (and all future id
releases) themselves, instead of going through Apogee, FormGen, or others.
According to Joe Siegler, there was no "divorce" between id and Apogee.  They
just parted ways peacefully, and employees of both get together regularly.
Some people still falsely believe that Doom is an Apogee game.  It's not!
It's by id and only id.  Apogee has nothing to do with it.  Nowhere in DOOM
will you find any reference to Apogee.

Also, Apogee is significantly bigger than id.  They work on twenty-some games
at a time, including those it distributes for other companies.  id consists of
a relatively small crew of programmers, and, for the most part, work on a
single game at a time.

Keen 6 and Spear of Destiny were written by id and distributed through
FormGen. Apogee resells these games and will provide tech support for them if
you bought them through Apogee.  As for Doom, Apogee does not even resell this,
and thus, will not provide tech support for it.

As a final note of confusion, Apogee and id are both situated in Texas, just
down the road from each other.

[2.3]  What awards has Apogee won?

Apogee has won over a hundred national and international awards -- far too
many to list here -- but here are some of the highlights:

    Commander Keen  - Best Entertainment Software         - 1992
    Commander Keen  - Best Overall                        - 1992
    Math Rescue     - Best Education Software             - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D  - Best Entertainment Software         - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D  - Best New Home, Hobby, Entertainment - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D  - Best Overall, People's Choice       - 1993

[2.4]  History of specific games

[2.4.1]  Keen

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Keen series:

Here's a short history of the Commander Keen games.  First, I'll list
all the games and their titles.  All of them were written by id
Software.

  1) Marooned on Mars    ---\
  2) The Earth Explodes     | ---> Invasion of the Vorticons
  3) Keen Must Die       ---/
3.5) Keen Dreams
  4) Secret of the Oracle    --\__  Goodbye Galaxy
  5) The Armageddon Machine  --/
  6) Aliens Ate My Babysitter

Episodes 1-3 are collectively called "Invasion of the Vorticons",
and are published by Apogee Software.   This series of Commander Keen
was released on December 14th, 1990, according to Tom Hall, Apogee's
Creative Director, and at the time, Creative Director of id Software.

Episodes 4 & 5 are collectively called "Goodbye Galaxy", and are also
published by Apogee Software.  This series of Commander Keen was
released somewhere around June of 1991.  There was also a special CGA
edition of Keens 4-5 made.  The game is functionally exactly the same
as the standard EGA version of the game, but the graphics are in CGA.

Episode 6 is a "stand alone" game, and is entitled "Aliens Ate my
Babysitter".  This episode of Keen is distributed by FormGen.  It is
commercial software, and is available at your local software store
(such as CompUSA).  This is also sold by Apogee, but Apogee only
resells this product, we don't actually distribute it.  FormGen also
decided to put off-disk copy protection on the full version of this
game.  Furthermore, FormGen also has a playable 3 level commercial
demo available for perusal before purchase.  Apogee Software sells a
version of Keen 6 in CGA.  I do not know if FormGen sells the CGA
version of Keen 6 in the stores; it may only be available from Apogee
Software.  Check with FormGen for more details.

Keen Dreams has kind of an interesting story.  This is referred to as
the "Lost Episode" of Commander Keen.   I like to think of it as "Keen
Episode 3.5".  The reason for that is that Keen Dreams falls in between
Vorticons and Galaxy, both in terms of technology and storyline.
Before the id guys actually formed id, the majority of them worked at
Softdisk, a computer software publisher in Shreveport, LA.  The
founding members of id Software left Softdisk to do the Vorticons
series of Keen for Apogee Software.  However, they were contractually
obligated to deliver another game to Softdisk, and since development
had started on the Galaxy series, they threw together a Keen game for
Softdisk, and Keen Dreams was born.  This game is not sold by Apogee
Software, nor does Apogee have anything at all to do with it.  You'd
need to contact Softdisk for any further information regarding Keen
Dreams.

Episodes 1, 3.5, 4, and the 3 level demo for Episode 6 are
the only ones that you are legally allowed to upload and download
anywhere.  Episodes 2,3,5, and the full version of Episode 6 are
commercial software, and should not appear on any BBS, online service,
or should otherwise be sold except for authorized sellers of the
games.

Here are the BBS filenames as currently available from Apogee for the
various Keen games from Apogee.

Keen 1 -> #1KEEN.ZIP
Keen 4 -> #4KEEN.ZIP
Keen 4 -> #4KEENC.ZIP (Special CGA Version)

I've seen the 3 level Aliens Demo available with the filename
#6K-DEMO.ZIP.  I've seen Keen Dreams available with the filename
KDREAMS.ZIP.  However, neither of these are Apogee products, and I
cannot vouch for the files' names.

If you played Keen 5, there was a screen that said something to the
effect of "Join us in December 1992 for the greatest Keen adventure
yet".  There was a picture of Keen smiling, with a Santa Claus hat on.
At the time, id Software was intending to do a third series of
Commander Keen, tentatively entitled "Commander Keen: The Universe is
Toast".  However, other projects came up (Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of
Destiny, and later, Doom).  At this time, there is no development
going on in the Commander Keen department.  There will eventually be
more Commander Keen games by Apogee Software.  However, even if the
work were to commence on the game TODAY, it would still take about 12
months to see the light of day.  The earliest development could start
on this game would be early in 1995, so I would not look for any new
Commander Keen games before the Spring of 1996.

[2.4.2]  Wolfenstein 3D

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Wolfenstein series:

On May 5, 1992, Apogee Software released the shareware episode of
Wolfenstein 3D, and has been distributing it in the shareware market
since then.  Apogee is the official distributor of Wolfenstein 3D's
original 6 episodes in the shareware market.

Somewhere around September of 1992, FormGen Corp released Spear of
Destiny.  This is a retail sequel to Wolfenstein 3D.  This game
consisted of one episode with 20 levels.  It has some new wall
art, a couple of new objects, and new boss creatures.  This game
is essentially the same as Wolf3D generally, but is completely
new in the level design aspect.  This game is available in stores
like CompUSA.  Apogee also resells this product, but is not
responsible for the distribution of it.  Apogee has to buy it from
FormGen like any other store would.  There is a 2 level playable demo
floating around for Spear of Destiny.  It's the same first two levels
that appear in the full version of the game.  This is not shareware.
Commercial demos are for the most part non-interactive.  This one *IS*
interactive, and since it bears a close resemblance to Wolfenstein 3D,
which is shareware, the SOD demo is frequently mistaken for being
shareware, which it is not.

There have been numerous editors and extra levels appear for both
Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny.  In regards to Wolf3D, Apogee
respectfully requests that you not make or distribute any editor/extra
level/add on that will modify the shareware episode.  If you choose to
do this, please make these items for the registered version only; and
be aware that Apogee cannot support user created items.

Somewhere in mid/late 1993, id Software decided that they were going
to publish these same 6 original episodes in the retail market.
These are the same 6 episodes that Apogee had been selling since May
of 1992.  Since Apogee was at that time not set up for retail
distribution, id Software went with another company, and that company
is GT Software.   This package is available in CompUSA, and contains
the same 6 episodes that Apogee is the distributor of.  Apogee has
absolutely nothing at all to do with this product.  The GT Software
version of Wolfenstein 3D is totally a GT deal.  Apogee has no control
over the packaging, the quality control, or the price.

In May of 1994, FormGen Corporation released an update to Spear of
Destiny.  I do not remember the exact title offhand, but it's
something like "Spear of Destiny Missions 2 & 3".  This is an add-on
to Spear of Destiny, and has some new level graphics, some differently
colored actors, but is essentially more levels for Spear of Destiny.
This extra version (The extra episodes are called "Return to Danger",
and "Ultimate Challenge") does require that you have the first Spear
of Destiny game (The original 6 Apogee Wolf episodes are not required).
Apogee Software has absolutely nothing to do with this prodct.  We do
not sell it, and we do not support it.  This is a FormGen deal completely.

id Software released a version of Wolfenstein 3D for the Super
Nintendo somewhere around Jan/Feb of 1994.  This was published
througha company called "Imagineer."  Due to Nintendo restrictions,
some of the cooler elements had to be removed.  These were, (1) all
Nazi references, (2) the dogs (replaced with rats), and (3) blood
(replaced with sweat).  This is still a cool game, considering
}what it's programmed for.  There was a version released for the
}Atari Jaguar around July or August of 1994, and this version is
}probably the graphically best of any version published.  When you
}go up right against walls and the like, they do not become blocky or
}chunky.  They're actually quite good.  I do not know who published
}this version.  id has also licensed someone (again, I don't know who)
}to write a Macintosh version of Wolfenstein 3D.  Last I heard, it will
}either be out late 1994, or sometime in 1995.  I have no idea as to
}what Macintosh it will require, or anything other than "there will be
}a Wolf3D for the Mac."  Again, Apogee has nothing to do with this
}version.

The premiere issue of Game Developer's Magazine stated that Apogee
Software was working on a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II", which
was to be a totally new game, with completely new actors, and totally
new everything; the only thing the same being the title Wolfenstein 3D.
This information is incorrect; there is no such title under production
at either Apogee or id Software.

Note: Spear of Destiny and Aliens Ate My Babysitter are commercial pieces of
      software by FormGen Corporation.  id Software wrote both of them, and
      FormGen distributes them.  Apogee only resells these titles.  There are
      demos available from FormGen for these games, but they are not Apogee
      titles, and Apogee does not distribute the demos for these games.

* - There is an optional CGA mode in Paganitzu.  There are CGA versions of
    Keen 4-6.

}[3.2]  The games are too big to download!  Are there "split" versions?

[3.4]  What upgrade patches are currently available?

These are upgrades available on CompuServe, BBS's, and the Internet only; if
you need an upgrade that isn't listed, call Apogee.  The "S/R" field
says whether the patch is for the shareware or registered version of the game.
If it's for the registered version, the form NReg means that it is the upgrade
patch for the registered N-episode version.

[3.7]  What Apogee games are no longer supported?

Apogee no longer takes orders, technical calls, or any other form of support
for the following games:  The Thor Trilogy, SuperNova, Beyond the Titanic,
Word Whiz, and Trivia Whiz.  Apogee retains the copyright on these games, but
not much else.

There are three games that Apogee does not distribute, sell, or register
anymore.  These three are Jumpman Lives!, Star Trek Trivia, and Star Trek:TNG
Trivia.  Apogee retains no copyright on these, and requests that the shareware
episodes (if they exist) on any Apogee site be removed from distribution.

[3.8]  Which of Apogee's games are good?

What follows is my own personal evaluation of each game, based on several
different things.  The last evaluation for each game is an overall rating.
It is not an average of the other ratings; instead, it correlates to how
much I like and play the game personally.  I try to make the ratings fairly
objective, compensating as best I can for any personal bias.  Ratings are
given on a scale of 1 to 5.  A rating of 2.5 is a mediocre rating.  Anything
less constitutes substandard quality.  A rating of 3 would probably only
impress fans of the genre (or games in general).  A rating of 4 means
excellent.  A rating of 5 does not mean perfect (in the computer gaming
world, perfection is never achieved, for somebody always comes out with a
game that's one step better), but it does mean you're nuts if you don't
love it.  :-)

For the "graphics" field, a letter precedes each rating, which indicates
whether the game's best video mode is (T)ext, (C)GA, (E)GA, (V)GA, or
(S)VGA.  Just because a game uses a higher video mode than another does not
mean that it will get a higher rating; for instance, I've seen many EGA
games with more impressive graphics than other VGA games.   The "enemies"
field rates how unique, challenging, well-animated, and interesting your
enemies are.  Some games do not have monsters or enemies, and thus, do not
have a rating under this field.  The "level" field rates the thought that
went into the design of the levels.  Level design also has an indirect
impact on the gameplay.  The "overall" field is not an average of the
previous four ratings, but rather a rating of how lastingly enjoyable the
game is to play.  "Gameplay" has a strong influence on this rating.

If I've left a field blank, it's because I don't feel adequately qualified
to make a judgment.  The games at the end are ones I played only briefly and
could not make an "overall" judgment.

One final note:  in Joe Siegler's words, "Ultimately, you, the reader are
the only person who can make up your own mind about whether a game is good.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so is the enjoyment factor of
computer games.  Only you can decide whether you'll like our games or not."

[4.1]  The Shareware Episodes

[4.1.1]  Software Creations BBS

Apogee's home BBS is the Software Creation BBS.  There are over a hundred
lines.  Apogee's games are released here first before anywhere else in
the world.  The numbers are:

    (508) 365-2359 2400 baud
    (508) 368-7036  (at)  9600-14.4k v.32bis
    (508) 365-4035  (at)  28.8k v.fc / v.34

[4.1.2]  Anonymous FTP

The official FTP site for Apogee is ftp.uml.edu.  uml has several mirror sites
which can be used in the event that uml is down or too crowded.  Mirrors are
generally updated on a daily basis.  A list of sites follows:

Type "GO APOGEE" at a ! prompt.

[4.1.4]  America On-Line

Use the keyword "APOGEE" to go to Apogee's forum.

[4.1.5]  Fidonet

If you are a Fidonet SysOp, you can get Apogee's games on the Fido Filebone.
Talk to your local filebone hub about the four Apogee areas.  See FILEBONE.NA
for more information.

[4.2]  The Registered Episodes

The registered versions of the software are the complete versions, and, as
they are not shareware, cannot legally exist on public BBS's or FTP sites.
The registered versions of the software must be purchased directly from
Apogee or from one of Apogee's dealers.

In many of Apogee's newer games, a DEALERS.EXE executable is archived with
the game.  This is an executable readme containing a list of the foreign
dealers that sell Apogee's software.

[4.2.1]  Ordering information

To order directly from Apogee, call 1-800-APOGEE1.  The line is open 24 hours
a day.  They'll need to know what disk size you desire, the best graphics
mode you are able to run (CGA, EGA, VGA, SVGA), and whether you have an XT,
286, 386, 486, or Pentium.  Note that some games have minimum CPU and
graphics requirements.  Also note that Apogee's VGA games come only on high
density disks.

Use the ORDER.FRM file, which comes with virtually all of Apogee's games, if
you want to send in an order by mail.  Send it to:

    Apogee Software, Ltd.
    P.O. Box 496389,
    Garland TX 75049-6389

Or, you can fax a copy of your order to (214) 278-4670.  Please include a
return fax number if you make use of this facility.

[4.2.2]  Software Creations BBS

By October 1994, you will be able to download the full registered versions
of any Apogee game by using a credit card for payment.  (Apogee will mail
you the game manual and catalog, which you will receive a few days later.)
See section 3.1.1 for information on calling Software Creations.

[5.1]  Things to try first

If you have a program with an Apogee game not starting correctly, there are a
few things you should try first.  The most common startup error is that there
is not enough memory to load the game.  There are a few methods of freeing up
RAM.  First, try removing any TSRs that you do not need, such as unneeded
drivers, virus scanners (only if necessary!), etc.  If you don't plan on using
the mouse for the game, you can unload the mouse from memory.  Then try to
start the game again.   You can also try booting "clean".  With MS-DOS 6.0 or
greater, you can do this by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the
system is booting.  This causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be
bypassed.

If the problem is EMS/XMS memory, then perhaps your memory manager (EMM386,
QEMM386, etc) is either set incorrectly or is incompatible with the game. Try
removing the memory manager altogether, first, since this seems to fix most
problems Apogee games have with EMS/XMS memory.

Barring all, read the directions; that's what I always say.  Apogee usually
includes an executable help" readme file with all their later games.  (The
filename is in the form XXXXHELP.EXE.)  Run this; detailed troubleshooting
instructions are usually included in this file.  There are plans underway
to make a file available on-line which will contain all the current versions
of the tech support files in them.

Also, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some
games, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the
game.  Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.

If you've tried everything and still can't get an Apogee game to work
correctly, Apogee's technical support line is (214) 278-5655.  It is open
from 8am-6pm.

[5.2]  Recommended system configuration

If your game still isn't up and running, even after reading all the docs
that came with the game, and you are reasonable sure it is your system's
configuration at fault, you might want to try comparing your autoexec.bat and
config.sys files with those given below.  If you have MS-DOS 6.0 or greater,
Apogee recommends creating a multi-boot option for Apogee.  If you do this,
the following commands should go there.  This is _without_ any drive
compression programs installed; you'll need to add the necessary commands if
you have a drive compression program.  (See the next section for more details
about this.)

Note that some of these commands probably require at least MS-DOS 5.0 or
greater.

------------

SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T1 (make sure to alter for your computer)
PATH C:\;C;\DOS

NOTE #1: Apogee does not recommend using disk caching programs such as
         SMARTDRV.  Apogee's games have their own caching routines, and
         other disk caching programs may even cause the game to slow down.
NOTE #2: You will need to insert the proper "SET BLASTER" line on your
         computer, or the appropriate sound card drivers you need.

[5.3]  Setting the BLASTER environment variable

If you are having problems with your soundblaster, it could be because the
BLASTER environment variable is not set correctly.  Check to make sure that
you have the appropriate SET BLASTER command in your autoexec.bat file.
A sample SET BLASTER command follows:

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3
 |    |      |    | |  |
 |    |      |    | |  |______ Type of Card
 |    |      |    | |_________ DMA Channel
 |    |      |    |___________ Interrupt
 |    |      |________________ Port Address
 |    |_______________________ Environment Variable
 |____________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal
sign (=).  If you have a space in there, your system will read it
incorrectly, and it will not be recognized by Apogee games.

Consult your card manual for information on how to tell at what
settings your card is set.  The information *is* important, so it's
recommended that you know precisely what the settings are.  If you
are using a card that emulates the Soundblaster, you should check your
card's manual on how to set the card for Soundblaster emulation.

Port address is almost always 220.  Unless you've changed it, it's a
safe bet that your card is set at 220.

The interrupt varies from system to system.  Apogee's games prior to
Raptor do not support IRQs higher than 7.  Starting with Raptor,
Apogee's sound code supports the higher IRQs.  IRQ 2 is not recommended,
as it may cause problems.

The DMA channel is almost always 1 by default.  DMA conflicts are the
cause of several problems.  If you get lockups with an Apogee game
that has digitized sounds, try turning off the digitized sounds and
running it again.  If it works, then you have a DMA conflict.  Adjust
the DMA on your sound card, then reflect said change the BLASTER
environment variable.

The type of card is either 1 or 3 if you do not have a genuine Soundblaster.
Try 1 first; if it doesn't work, try 3.  If you have a genuine Soundblaster,
use 1 or 3 for a plain Soundblaster, 2 or 4 for a Soundblaster Pro, or
6 or a Soundblaster 16.  If it's an older card, choose the lower number
(1 or 2).

[5.4]  Drive compression programs

As mentioned before, Apogee has run tests on its full product line with MS-DOS
6.22's DriveSpace compression program.  All games save Monster Bash, which
suffered a slowdown, worked fine.  If you are having problems with DriveSpace,
try using the system configuration recommended above, with the addition line:

DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DRVSPACE.SYS /MOVE

...appended to the end of the config.sys file.  Also, Apogee's games have
been tested on Stacker v3.1 and v4.0 and work fine on both.  Naturally,
you will need appropriate Stacker commands in the config.sys and/or
autoexec.bat files.

[5.5]  By game

This section contains some common problems, and their solutions, for specific
Apogee games.  In addition to perusing this section, you might want to look
at the cheats section; technical support parameters are listed there also,
which may help to fix your problem.

[Raptor]

 Problem:  I'm using a joystick, and I can't move down.
 Solution: You're most likely running Raptor v1.0.  Upgrade to the latest
           version.
 Problem:  Raptor locks on me sometimes.
 Solution: Are you using an 8-bit SoundBlaster?  Apogee is currently working
           on Raptor v1.2, which fixes this problem.  It will be released
           shortly; sit tight until the patch comes out.  In the meantime,
           use Adlib; it won't sound as good, but it will work.
 Problem:  I can't save or load games.
 Solution: Increase the value "files" is set to in your config.sys.  Note that
           if you booted clean, this would have been bypassed.
 Problem:  My mouse won't go over the entire screen, only in a corner.
 Solution: This is usually due to an old version of your mouse driver.  Check
           with the mouse manufacturer to see if a more recent version is
           available.

[Duke Nukem II]

 Problem:  Certain levels lock on me.
 Solution: There's no good solution for this yet.  It's a sprite problem,
           and Apogee isn't really sure how to fix.  You could try rebooting,
           and trying the level again.  If the problem persists, then playing
           on a lower difficulty level might help.

[Monster Bash]

 Problem:  Rock monsters freeze in place.
 Solution: You're running an old version of Monster Bash.  Get the most recent
           version, which is v2.1.
 Problem:  I can't get by the dragon in Episode 1 Level 4 no matter what I do.
 Solution: The correct way by is to crawl until you're past him.  If this does
           not work, and he still wakes up, you have an old version.  Get the
           current version, which is v2.1.
 Problem:  In episode 3, I can take the broom and, in one place, fly off the
           top of the screen.  Then the game crashes.
 Solution: Don't go up there; there's nothing of value there.

[6]  Cheats
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[6.1]  Overview

Apogee has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games, both
documented and undocumented.  In their later games, however, these cheats are
only available in the registered versions of the games.  From 1987 to
around May 1993, Apogee games came with a hint sheet, which often contained
cheats in them.  From May 1993 to December 1993, Apogee games were shipped
with a XXXXHINT.EXE file, which had the same text as the old hint sheets.
Beginning in 1994, the XXXXHINT.EXE files are done away with too; the
information is now contained in the actual game manuals.

The cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.
The customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or
game manual that comes with the game.  Some of the games also have a debugging
mode, which is not generally documented.  Their original purpose is to aid in
the beta testing of the game.  Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is
left intact, available for the regular game-player to use.  Finally, there are
technical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to
correct some technical problems.

[6.2]  What's that about cows and monkeys in Raptor?

Raptor was written by Cygnus, and it seems to be a birthday present to
themselves.  Whenever Raptor is started when your system's clock matches the
birthday of one of the people at Cygnus (there are six or seven or so), then
Raptor behaves a little strangely.  First, the Apogee logo is displayed, but
not with Apogee's trademark music.  Instead, you hear the Cygnus folks,
sounding a little tipsy, humming the Apogee theme music themselves.  In
addition, some of the Raptor levels contain enemies that don't normally appear
such as monkeys who throw coconuts at you, raptor dinosaurs scurrying across
he screen, and cows with machine guns concealed beneath their hides.  Most of
these peculiar enemies appear on the first mission of the game, and they are
invariably difficult to kill.

Finally, when you exit the game, you get to hear the member of Cygnus whose
birthday it is, give an impersonation of a monkey.  This might consist of
hooting or screeching sounds, or simply an eloquent rendering of the word
"monkey."

Now the reason this section is in with the cheats is because there is a way,
beyond setting the system time to a particular birthday, of getting the
monkeys and raptors and cows to fight you.  When the screen comes up where you
must choose a sector to fly, flip the switch at the bottom center of the
screen by clicking on it with the mouse.  It should darken.  This activates
the three lights to the right of this switch.  In version 1.0 of Raptor, you
should turn on the first and third lights; in version 1.1 of Raptor, you
should turn all three lights on.  Then you can select a sector or "auto
pilot" and fly the level.  You'll know the cheat worked if you hear a static
like sound.  All levels have some new enemy that appears by using this cheat,
though sometimes they are small and inconspicuous.  Besides monkeys, cows,
and raptors, there are:  the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship from
Space 1999, a woman sunbathing on a roof, and other miscellaneous things.

[6.3]  Complete Cheat List

This section contains a variety of cheats from various Apogee games.
Actually, in the words of Joe Siegler, it's "the first comprehensive cheat
[list] ever published for all Apogee titles."

Note that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by Apogee,
the debug keys are not.  If you use the debug keys, Apogee cannot provide
any support, since this alters game performance to a state where their
standard support comments and issues might not apply.  In short, neither
Apogee or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug
keys.  (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing
happening.)


}[Mystic Towers]
}
}+ Customer Cheat - Cheats are activated by typing "BALDRIC" during a level.
}                   Once actived, your score is reset to zero, and you can
}                   press the following key combos to achieve what is listed:
}
}      [lshift] R - then xx where xx is a number of a room to jump to (01-45)
}      [lshift] H - for maximum health, also food and drink
}      [lshift] K - for all keys except the end of tower key
}      [lshift] W - for full weapons
}      [lshift] C - for ten coins
}
}                   Only the health cheat works in the shareware version; the
}                   rest require the registered version.
}
}
}[Hocus Pocus]
}
}+ Customer Cheat - Type these:
}
}                 FEELGOOD - Gives full health
}                    BLAKE - Gives both keys
}                   BANANA - Gives laser shots (registered version only)
}                    QUARK - Gives rapid fire (registered version only)


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

+ Customer Cheat - The backspace key will restore all your energy and give
                   you a death ray, at the cost of all your money.  This
                   will only work in the registered version.

+ Debug mode - Set the environment variable "S_HOST" to the value "CASTLE"
               at the DOS prompt by typing "SET S_HOST=CASTLE" (it must be
               in caps).  Then, when you play Raptor, you become completely
               invincible, and have all the weapons at your disposal.

+ Warp - There is a level warp built into the game, so you can see any level
         you want at any time.  What you need to do is to get to the screen
         where you see the level selection (Bravo Sector, etc...).  The warp
         combination is a 2 key entry.  The keys are not to be pressed at the
         same time.

  Key 1 - Z, X, or Y (Z is Episode 1, X is Episode 2, and Y is Episode 3)
  Key 2 - Any key between Q and O on the keyboard.  Q is Level 1, and O is
          Level 9.

  This works in both the shareware and registered versions.  However, if you
  try and warp to a registered episode from the shareware version, it will
  crash the game.

+ Other notes - With a hex editor, change bytes 27h and 28h of a Raptor saved
                game file (char????.fil) to the value FF.  When you load this
                saved game, you'll have a few million dollars to spend on
                equipment.  If you don't have a hex editor, there are some
                programs available that do this for you.  RapCheat is one;
                RapCash is another.  Both should be available at ftp.uwp.edu
                under the directory /pub/msdos/games/romulus/cheats.  Some
                people have reported problems using RapCash; I don't know if
                these problems have been fixed since or not.

+ Birthday Mode - As mentioned above, the "Birthday Mode" will automatically
                  put you into "Battle Cow" mode, and it will also play the
                  goofy Apogee theme song.  To get it, change the system's
                  date to the birthday of one of the Cygnus programmers.  The
}                 only known dates at this time are May 16 and August 28.
                  Any year should be ok, as long as it's not in the past.  You
                  can also get "Battle Cow" mode by darkening the switch on
                  the "choose sector" screen, and turning on all three lights
                  on the right (for v1.0, don't turn on the middle light).
                  You don't get the goofy Apogee theme song if you do it this
                  way, however.


[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike]

+ Customer Cheat - [J] [A] [M] [Enter] - These keys are to be pressed one at a
                   time.  When all are pressed, the message "Now you're
                   Jammin'" appears, and you will be given all keys, and you
                   will get 100% health.  Your score will also be taken to 0.
                   This will only work on the registered version of the game.

+ Debug Mode - Command Line Parameters

  POWERBALL - Enables debug keys. Requires the [LSHIFT] & [RSHIFT] to be
              held down during the JAM Logo intro.  You must keep holding
              these keys until the PC-13 Screen is loaded.  You will hear
              a "ching" sound during the intro when Debug Mode has been
              successfully enabled.  The "ching" sound will only happen if
              you have a sound card. If you have a PC Speaker, you won't hear
              this.
       TICS - Display TIC INFO in score area.
      MUSIC - Enable music test mode: [backspace] [arrows] changes music.
      RADAR - Displays a rotating overhead view during gameplay.  Please note
              that this *REALLY* slows the game down, to the point of being
              unplayable.

              These cheat keys can be use during gameplay only if you invoked
              the program with the "powerball" parameter:

       [backspace] W - Warp to level (SHIFT-W loads the DEFAULT MAP)
       [backspace] D - Player invisible (dumb objects)
       [backspace] G - God mode

       [backspace] O - Show hidden walls on auto mapper
       [backspace] E - Quick Win Mission
       [backspace] B - Border color
       [backspace] C - Count objects
       [backspace] F - Facing spot
       [backspace] H - Hurt self (only if not in God mode)
       [backspace] S - Slow motion
       [backspace] V - Extra VBLS
  [backspace] [home] - Dec sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgup] - Inc sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
   [backspace] [end] - Dec ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgdn] - Inc ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
       [backspace] + - Add shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] - - Dec shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] ] - Inc shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] [ - Dec shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [shift] [tab] - Show Full automap containing all live actors.

     These cheat keys can be used during gameplay:

           [6] [7] - Collect all bonus items (gold, ammo, health, etc.)
           [7] [8] - Kill all actors.
           [6] [8] - Collect all bonus items and kill all actors.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters - These aren't really debug codes, or
       cheats, either.  They're in here for Apogee's Tech Support to use in
       assisting customers who might be having problems running the game.

    VERSION - Display version information.
     SYSTEM - Display system information.
 HIDDENCARD - Disable checking for video card.
     NOJOYS - Disable checking for joysticks.
    NOMOUSE - Disable checking for mouse.
     NOMAIN - Disable checking for main memory.
      NOEMS - Disable checking for EMS memory.
      NOXMS - Disable checking for XMS memory.
       NOAL - Disable checking for AdLib.
       NOSB - Disable checking for Sound Blaster.
      NOPRO - Disable checking for Sound Blaster Pro.
       NOSS - Disable checking for Sound Source.
        SST - Disable checking for Tandy Sound Source.
        SS1 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT1.
        SS2 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT2.
        SS3 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT3.
      NO386 - Disable checking for 386.
   ENABLEGP - Enables NoteBook GamePort checking (This will do bad things if
                                                  you try it on an Acer)


[Duke Nukem II]

+ Customer Cheat - For the registered version only, the following two codes
                   can be typed in during gameplay.  Please note that all
                   three letters have to be pressed at the same time.

  [E] [A] [T] - health is restored to maximum, but score is reset to zero
  [N] [U] [K] - get a random weapon, plus all inventory required to finish
                the current level


[Halloween Harry]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [B] [I] [G] all at the same time will give you
                   full health and jetpack power.

+ Tech Parameter - Pressing these four keys at the same time will show you the
                   coordinates you are at on the level.  This serves no real
                   function on it's own, but it is used by Apogee's Game Hint
                   Line sometimes to locate a player in a level.  The keys are
                   [ctrl] [alt] [rshift] [F12]


[Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [I] [L] [M] all at the same time, will give you
                   both keys, and will give you 100% health.  It will also
                   take your score to zero.  This cheat will work in both the
                   shareware and the registered version.

+ Debug mode -

  The debug mode is activated with a different command line parameter
  depending on what version of the game you have.

  v1.0  -> -next
           Once in the game, press [ctrl] [alt] [enter] to activate.

  v1.1+ -> -goobers
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Spear -> -debugmode
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Once activated, these are the keys you can use.

  [tab] q - Quit
  [tab] w - Warp to level xx
  [tab] e - Exit to next level
  [tab] t - Debug info in memory
  [tab] i - Free items
  [tab] o - Map of level
  [tab] s - Slow motion
  [tab] f - Position info
  [tab] g - God mode (no damage)
  [tab] h - Hurt yourself
  [tab] x - Extra stuff (???)
  [tab] c - Statistics
  [tab] v - Increase/decrease game speed
  [tab] b - Change border color
  [tab] n - No clipping (walk through walls)
            This does not work in the registered version of Wolf3D.  This mode
            causes really bad things to happen to the game, and it can even
            corrupt your copy of the game, which is why it was taken out.
  [tab] m - Memory map

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters are the same as in Blake Stone, except
  VERSION, SYSTEM, and ENABLEGP do nothing in Wolf3D.

+ Note 1: If you press [B] [A] [T] all at once, you'll get a message wondering
          why you're trying to cheat, since this is the old Keen Galaxy cheat
          code.

+ Note 2: For Spear only, if you do nothing in the game for 30 seconds, BJ
          will either cross his eyes or stick his tongue out at you.  It
          happens really quickly, so you have to watch carefully.


[Bio Menace]

+ Customer Cheat -  [C] [A] [T] - During gameplay, you can press these three
                    letters at the same time, and you will receive the machine
                    gun, 99 ammo, & 99 grenades.  This works only in the
                    registered version.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters -

}       COMP       - Turn on SVGA compatibility
}       NOAL       - Disable Adlib sound card detection
        NOJOYS     - Disable joystick detection
        NOMOUSE    - Disable mouse detection
}       HIDDENCARD - Disable video card detection

+ Other Notes - The following secret weapons are available in both the
                shareware and registered versions:

        Super Plasma Bolt - hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                            then hit fire; this causes one hit point of damage
          Fireball Attack - turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                            then hit fire
          Electron Shield - turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                            then hit the jump key
      Invincibility Burst - hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                            then hit the down arrow


[Monster Bash]

+ Customer Cheat - In the registered version only, you can press the [Z] and
                   [F10] keys down simultaneously to receive five lives.  Hold
                   down [Z] first; since the [F10] key, by itself, has meaning
                   in the game, the cheat won't work if you push both down at
                   the same time and the [F10] is the first to register.


[Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons]

+ Customer Cheat - Either of these cheats will work with either the shareware
                   or registered versions of the game.  The key combinations
                   need to be pressed at the same time.

  [C] [T] [SpaceBar] - Gives Pogostick, all Keycards, and full Ammo
  [Shift] [Tab]      - Passes through unplayed level on world map

+ Debug mode - Pressing all three of these at the same time will put you in
               God mode, and will give you a "jump cheat", which means when
               you press "jump", you fly.  [G] [O] [D]


[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing the [B] [A] [T] keys all at once will give you 99
                   shots, an extra life, and all the gems.  This does not work
                   on early versions of Aliens Ate My Babysitter.

+ Debug Mode - Pressing [A] [2] [Enter] all at once will activate debug mode.
               Once activated, these keys will perform the following
               functions:

               [F10] [G] God Mode
               [F10] [I] Free Items
               [F10] [J] Jump Cheat (Note that you will not be able to jump
                                     down while the jump cheat is activated)
               [F10] [N] No Clipping (Be careful.  If you fall off the bottom
                                      of the level, you'll die, even if you
                                      are in God Mode.)
               [F10] [Y] View Hidden Areas in the level.
               [F10] [B] Set border color (1-15)
               [F10] [C] Show number of active/inactive objects in the level
               [F10] [D] Record a demo
               [F10] [E] End the current level
               [F10] [M] Display memory usage
               [F10] [S] Slow motion

                   keys, and full gun power.  This can be used in either the

                             keep on using it to progress through the levels.


[Major Stryker]

+ Customer Cheat - The cheats here are a bit more complicated than in other
                   games.  There is a two step procedure to active the cheat
                   mode.  (This cheat mode only works in the registered
                   version.  It does nothing in the shareware version.)

                   Step 1 - Type [C] [H] [E] [A] [T] at the Main Title Screen.
                            All keys need to be pressed one at a time.  When
                            you get it, you'll see the message that says
                            "Cheat Active (it really isn't yet).
                   Step 2 - During the game, hold down the [BackSpace] key,
                            and then press the [H] & [S] keys at the same
                            time.  When you are successful, you'll see a
                            message that says "Cheat Mode On" (it is now).

                  Once activated, you can press these keys to activate various
                  options.  Please note that you must HOLD DOWN the [Tab] key
                  first before pressing the others, or it won't work.

                  [Tab] [O] - Fire Options
                  [Tab] [R] - Rapid Fire
                  [Tab] [S] - Shield Options

+ Debug mode - Pressing [Z] [E] [U] [S] all at the same time will put you into
               God mode, and will let you activate the other debug mode key,
               which is [G].  Pressing that will reverse the gravity in the
               game.


[Secret Agent]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing these key combinations at the same time will

                   [P] [A] [M] - Level Warp.  When you hit this combination,
                                 the game will freeze.  Press a number here,
                                 and you will be taken to that level.  You
                                 will not be able to see the number when you
                                 are typing it.
