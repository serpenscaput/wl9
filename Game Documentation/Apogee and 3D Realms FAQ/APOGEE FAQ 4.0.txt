[1.1]  A word from me

Who am I?  I'm just another Apogee fan, the primary difference between you and
me being that I'm the one flaunting my vast sea of Apogee knowledge.  I don't
guarantee that all of the facts in this FAQ are true, but I try to make
this as informative and truthful a document as I humanly can without playing
hookey from work or school.  (I do have priorities, after all.)  If you have
some tidbits of information, or, heck, a whole flood of information tidbits,
let me know and I'll put it in the FAQ along with your name in the credits.
The best way to reach me is through the internet.  Try these addresses in

[1.2]  About this FAQ

This FAQ is copyrighted (see above) by Samuel Stoddard.  While it is
authorized and "officialized" by Apogee, it is not the property nor the
work of Apogee.  However, Apogee has contributed generously to its
creation and growth; for that, I offer my sincere thanks.

As of version 2.4w, this FAQ is also available in HTML format (see the
section on "obtaining the latest version of the FAQ" for information on
how to access it).  The HTML versions of the FAQ will always have a
trailing "w" as part of the version number; this denotes it as an HTML
version as opposed to a text version of the FAQ.  The text versions will
always be quicker to appear, and, for minor updates, I may skip
the HTML release altogether.  However, I will try to keep both versions
reasonably up to date.

[1.2.1]  Obtaining the latest version of the FAQ

There are a few ways to get the latest copy of either the text based
version or the HTML version of the Apogee FAQ.  These are listed below.

[1.2.1.1]  Obtaining the text based version

 - Via anonymous FTP:  a latest version of the Apogee FAQ can be found
   in the following places:
       - ftp.uml.edu       /msdos/games/apogee/faq/apogee.faq
       - wcl-l.bham.ac.uk  /pub/djh/faqs/Apogee.faq
       - ftp.wustl.edu     /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/game_faq/apogeeXX.faq
       - ftp.wustl.edu     /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/games/Apogee/apogeeXX.faq
   "XX" is the version number.  Note that since I upload to ftp.wustl.edu
   directly, this site will receive new versions more quickly than the
   other two sites.
 - Through Usenet:  I try to post the FAQ in alt.games.apogee,
   comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc, and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on a regular
   basis.  New versions will be posted to all three newsgroups immediately
   upon release.
 - Email:  write me at ss1@kepler.unh.edu or stoddard@ctron.com.

[1.2.1.2]  Obtaining the HTML based version
 
 - Using a World Wide Web client, connect to URL http://pubpages.unh.edu/~ss1.
   From there, enter the PC Gaming Forum, followed by the FAQ library, and,
   lastly, the Apogee FAQ itself.
 - Alternatively, you can get to the FAQ directly by using the URL
   http://pubpages.unh.edu/~ss1/apogeefaq.html.

However, to keep requests posts to a minimum, please do not do this, unless
you are unable to obtain it via the other means listed here.

[1.4]  What is Apogee?

Apogee is a games distributor for PC games of many sorts.  It is a diverse
gaming company, contributing to several different genres of games.  While
much of what Apogee publishes are games written primarily by other companies,
such as Cygnus or Argo Games, Apogee writes their own games as well.  Apogee's
staff includes an array of talented programmers, artists, and musicians.  For
many years now, Apogee has been among the leading shareware games companies
for the PC and compatible market.

[1.5]  What does "Apogee" mean?

According to the American Heritage dictionary, "apogee" means:  "the point
in the orbit of the moon or of an artificial satellite most distant from
the earth."  Or, more generally, "the farthest or highest point; apex."
Related words are the Greek "apogaion," the neuter form of "apogaios"
which means "away from the earth."  There is also the New Latin word
"apogaeum," which is derived from the Greek word.  There is a French word
"Apogee" (with an accent over the first 'e').  In English, there is the
related word "apogean" and the antonym "perigee."

All this is academic, however, for according to the Apogee slogan, "Apogee
means action."  :-)

[1.6]  How Apogee markets its games

In 1987, Apogee came up with a unique method of marketing their games.  Since
then, other shareware companies have adopted their strategy.  Their scheme is
this:  each game they produce is divided into three to four, sometimes even
six episodes.  The first episode is free.  It can be downloaded from
CompuServe, BBS's, or the Internet, or bought in a store that distributes
shareware games for disk copying charges.  You can distribute the shareware
episode to your friends yourself, if you like, provided you leave all the
original files intact.

If you like the shareware episode of a game, Apogee requires that you register
it.  This is the normal rule regarding shareware.  Upon registration, you will
receive the complete game.  Apogee uses this marketing scheme so that people
can have a good idea about the game they are buying before they put their cash
on the line.

[1.7]  Getting the latest information

There are a few ways to get the latest information about Apogee, even if you
want it more quickly than keeping up with the latest revisions of this FAQ
would do.  These methods are mentioned briefly in the following sections:

[1.7.1]  Electronic news

On Usenet, the newsgroups alt.games.apogee, comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc.action,
and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc all carry discussion about Apogee's latest.
Apogee monitors these, plus the gaming, shareware, and Apogee support
conferences on Fidonet, Rime, Intelec, ILink, U'NI-Net, and Smartnet.

[1.7.2]  Apogee's internet mailing list

Apogee has an Internet mailing list.  Whenever new games or slide shows are
released (or other important information), Apogee sends the information out in
a mailing.  If you would like to be on this mailing list, contact Joe Siegler
(joe.siegler@apogee1.com, joe.siegler@swcbbs.com, or apogee@metronet.com, in
that order).  Those email addresses send directly to Joe Siegler, and not
to a list daemon or robot.  The mailing list is free of charge.

[1.7.3]  Finger files

On the internet, you can finger apogee@fohnix.metronet.com, and receive all
the latest information about Apogee.  Usually this entails both recent and
upcoming releases, among other things.  If apogee@fohnix.metronet.com does
not work, try apogee@metronet.com.

[2.1]  Other companies

[2.1.1]  What is Apogee's relationship with 3D Realms?

Apogee and 3D Realms are sister companies, both divisions of Action
Entertainment, Inc.  Originally, Action Entertainment's next-generation
of 3D games were going to be published under the Apogee name.  However,
in late August of 1994, 3D Realms was born, and the four next-generation
3D games that Action had under production (namely, "Blood," "Duke Nukem 3D,"
"Ruins: Return of the Gods," and "Shadow Warrior," all of which use the
"build" engine) are now under the 3D Realms label.

[2.1.2]  What is Apogee's relationship with id?

Apogee and id Software are two completely different companies.  They
always have been, always will be.  Apogee doesn't own id; id doesn't own
Apogee; nor is one a division of the other.

Apogee Software writes and distributes software.  Of the many games that
Apogee has published, only a handful have not been written by Apogee as
well.  id Software wrote three of these games, namely, Keen Vorticons, Keen
Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D.

id Software writes software, and up until Doom, had never published anything
themselves.  id has published through a few companies, Apogee being one of
them.  As mentioned before, Keen Vorticons, Keen Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D
were distributed by Apogee.  (At later dates, id went on and also published
Keen Galaxy and Wolf3D in the stores through GT Software, but that's another
story.)  Some earlier id efforts such as Catacombs Abyss are distributed
through Softdisk.  (Technically, games like Catacombs Abyss, Dangerous Dave,
and Rescue Rover are Softdisk games, and not "id Software" games.  id's first
official game as "id Software" was Keen Vorticons.  While the same people
worked at Softdisk on the previously mentioned games, they are not
officially id Software games.)

id has published three commercial only games.  Two of these were published
by FormGen, those being Keen: Aliens Ate My Babysitter and Spear of Destiny.
These two are quite frequently assumed to be Apogee games, but they are not.
Check them; the name Apogee does not appear within.  Apogee does, however,
*resell* those two games, adding to the confusion.  But again, they do not
distribute them; they only sell them.  Apogee has to buy them from FormGen
like any other computer store would.  The third id retail game is Doom II,
published in the retail markets by GT Software.

Starting with Doom, id has been publishing on their own. Apogee has absolutely
nothing to do with Doom, nor future titles by id Software.  Furthermore,
starting with the release of Heretic, id Software will also be publishing games
on their own label.  They licensed their Doom engine to two companies, Cygnus
Studios (the people who did Raptor), and Raven Software.  The two games
produced under this agreement (Strife & Heretic respectively), are going to be
published under the "id" label exactly the same way that id Software themselves
published Wolfenstein 3D under the "Apogee" label.

There has been no "big divorce," or "feud" or something along those lines
between id and Apogee.  The id guys and the Apogee guys are all good friends,
and in fact get together every once in a while to shoot pool at the id
offices.  Other mutual activities include paintball (which also involves
Cygnus).  There was never a fallout between Apogee and id.  Anyone trying to
imply this is driving a wedge where it doesn't belong or exist.

[2.1.3]  What's Apogee's relationship with Parallax?

In the credits for the game Descent, written by Parallax and distributed by
Interplay, there is a thank you note to "Scott Miller and Apogee Software."
Mike Kulas, the leader for the project, was asked why that was in there,
and his response is given below.

          Hi Joe,

          We put Scott and Apogee in there because we truly appreciate
          all that Apogee did for us.  Scott showed a lot of faith in
          us when we didn't really have anything to show anybody.  If
          not for Scott, I don't think we would be anywhere near where
          we are today.

          You can tell people exactly this, if you like.

          Mike

[2.2]  What awards has Apogee won?

Apogee has won over a hundred national and international awards -- far too
many to list here -- but here are some of the highlights:

    Commander Keen  - Best Entertainment Software         - 1992
    Commander Keen  - Best Overall                        - 1992
    Math Rescue     - Best Education Software             - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D  - Best Entertainment Software         - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D  - Best New Home, Hobby, Entertainment - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D  - Best Overall, People's Choice       - 1993

}[2.3]  The Apogee theme song
}
}The earliest hint of a theme song for Apogee Software might have been in such
}early games as Crystal Caves and Secret Agent, wherein the then Apogee logo
}was accompanied by a series of trills uttered by the PC speaker.  It was
}less of a theme song and more of a "semi-standard opening" for Apogee games
}at the time.  The first real appearance of the familiar Apogee theme song,
}however, was in the game Major Stryker.  Today, any Apogee fan will
}instantly recognize the Apogee theme song and will probably be capable of
}humming it on command, though there's no guarantee that he'll simply refuse
}to do it.  The Apogee theme song is a short, simple, but sweet few bars,
}and one could easily imagine it as a theme in a symphony or fugue.
}
}Lee Jackson's paraphrased history of the Apogee theme song follows:
}
}Robert "Bobby" Prince, the composer of the scores of numerous Apogee games,
}did the original theme song, which appeared essentially unaltered in Major
}Stryker, Monster Bash, Bio Menace, Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, and Blake
}Stone: Planet Strike.  He composed a "rock"-like version for Duke Nukem II,
}which was later used in Raptor v1.2.  (Previous versions of Raptor had a
}version of the theme much like the original.)
}
}For Halloween Harry (Alien Carnage) and Mystic Towers, something different
}was needed.  These use MOD music instead of the MIDI-style used in our other
}games, so a new file was needed.  The folks at SubZero composed a dramatic
}version for Harry; a rather silly version was made for Mystic Towers, since
}since the game itself is quite silly.
}
}I took over the MIDI version of the fanfare starting with Hocus Pocus.  It
}wasn't something I was asked to do -- I just played around with an idea, gave
}it to Tom Hall and Joe Siegler, who then played it for Scott Miller and
}George Broussard, who dubbed it the "John Williams fanfare."  (It was actually
}an attempt to emulate the MOD file that SubZero did for Harry -- I always
}liked it.)  This fanfare has, to date, appeared in Hocus Pocus, Wacky Wheels,
}Boppin, and Rise of the Triad.  It is the current "official Apogee fanfare."

}[2.4]  The Dopefish
}
}Lee Jackson's history of the Dopefish:
}
}Dopefish is the product of the fertile mind of Tom Hall.  It was one of 24
}drawings he did of ideas for characters for Commander Keen: Goodbye, Galaxy!
}while part of id Software.  Dopefish was one of the characters from these
}drawings that made the cut.  According to Tom, "I just drew this stupid
}little fish," and the rest is history.
}
}Dopefish is described in the cast of characters for Secret of the Oracle as
}the second dumbest creature in the universe (the number one ranking is
}anyone's guess).  His thought patterns go, "swim swim hungry, swim swim
}hungry."  Dopefish "will eat anything alive and moving near them, though they
}prefer heroes."
}
}Dopefish was "adopted" by the Tech Support staff at Apogee soon after Joe
}Siegler, Steve Quarrella, and myself came onboard.  Dopefish was Joe's
}favorite character, and Steve was the resident Keen expert -- I provided a
}few vocal effects and some art.  We got hold of some screen capture software
}and went to town.
}
}The Dopefish "product line" started with an ANSI screen which Joe and I did --
}he converted a screen capture to raw ANSI, and I cleaned it up and made it
}presentable.  You can see the results by logging into Software Creations and
}typing DOPEFISH (or just DO for short) at the menu prompt.  After this, we
}convinced Jay Wilbur of id to have some Dopefish polo shirts made from an EPS
}file of the front-facing burping Dopefish (a.k.a. "Burpfish").  When Christmas
}rolled around, my wife decided we needed to bring Dopefish into the real
}world, so she made 20 or so stuffed Dopefish dolls (mostly side view, with a
}couple of Burpfish for good measure).  These were done in both EGA (green)
}and CGA (purple) versions and were given out at the Apogee Christmas party
}that year.  When Jay Wilbur heard of this, his first thought was that we
}needed to get a life.  This past Christmas, Brenda (my wife) took a printed
}enlargement of a screen capture and did pixel-for-pixel-accurate needlepoint
}tree ornaments, and Joe had coffee cups made with a Burpfish on them.  Below
}the Burpfish on the mugs is the caption, "Eat Your Veggies!", which is the
}title of the music for the level that Dopefish appears in, composed by Bobby
}Prince.
}
}Please note that this Dopefish merchandise is not, and was not ever, for
}sale to the general public.  They were all strictly in-house gags, so
}please don't swamp Apogee with requests for any of these items.  However,
}if you're a Dopefish fan yourself, and have created some goofy Dopefish
}items yourself, Joe Siegler would love to hear about it.  See the sections
}on "contacting Apogee" for information on how to reach him.
}
}Other Dopefish-related items that have appeared include several Windows and
}OS/2 desktops/icons (including the "official" OS/2 Apogee icon on the only
}OS/2 machine at the office, mine), screen savers, and fax images.  Joe has a
}full-page Dopefish that will occasionally mysteriously show up in someone
}else's fax machine.  Dopefish has also appeared in countless taglines,
}Internet signature files (described by Tom Hall as "Pisces Swimeatus"),
}and even in a reinterpretation of the birth of the universe, where the Big
}Bang is replaced by the Big Burp.  Steve even holds the title, granted via a
}mail-order ordainment service, as "Pope of the Church of the Dopey Fish."
}The title is legally recognized, by Texas state law.
}
}Why Dopefish?  Well, he swims, he eats, and he burps.  What more can you ask
}for?  I personally think that the latter reason is why Joe likes him so much.
}Joe is known for a few wall rattlers, and personally did the voice of Dopefish
}in Wacky Wheels and Rise of the Triad.  He really practiced for it, too.
}Sitting at his computer at four in the morning with a two liter bottle of
}Diet Coke, he ran through take after take, hurting himself a couple times
}in the process, until he came up with just the right length and resonance.
}
}To date, Dopefish has been involved in three Apogee games:  Commander Keen:
}Goodbye, Galaxy! (as a character), Wacky Wheels (making a secret cameo
}appearance), and Rise of the Triad (as a command line parameter and the
}subject of a song, the "Fish Polka," composed by me).  Even though he belongs
}to id Software, he is a welcome adopted member of the Apogee family.  If
}there are ever any new Keen games, you can wager a goodly amount that
}the Dopefish will be in it.

[2.5]  History of specific games

[2.5.1]  The Kroz Series

Scott Miller had been programming games since 1975, when he was in high
school.  In 1987 he wrote Kingdom of Kroz in Turbo Pascal, and, with the
full knowledge that, at the time, 99% of shareware was not profitable for
its authors, released it into the shareware market.  Thus, it was a
mystifying surprise when Kroz turned out to be a smash hit.  The letters
poured in, expressing love of the game and demanding sequels.  In 1988,
Kingdom of Kroz I received top honors in the game category of a national
programming contest, and came in second overall (it lost to a spreadsheet
program).  Scott Miller himself said, in the notes to a later version of
the game, "Thanks to Kroz I now know what a mutual fund is, but on the
downside my taxes require a book two inches thick to figure out."

In short, Kroz marked Apogee's birth, emergence into the national
mainstream, and coronation as one of the earliest kings of shareware.

What inspired Kroz?  At the time, Scott Miller's favorite games were
M.U.L.E., Archon, and Spelunker, among others.  He liked games where puzzle
solving was first, and the action secondary.  Kroz's main inspiration was
probably Rogue, which Scott used to play, but disliked for its randomness
and reliance on chance.  So Kroz was born.  Another of Scott's favorite
games is evident from the title; Kroz spelled backwards is "Zork," one of
Infocom's most famous and successful text adventure games.

The various episodes and versions of Kroz are many.  To confuse the issue,
Kroz, as well as many of the other early Apogee games, were not sold
strictly in a single bundle of three or four episodes.  The shareware
episode, Kingdom of Kroz, could be registered at a cost of $7.50, and this
registration made the customer eligible to buy other episodes at $7.50 each,
or several episodes at some savings.  The episodes of Kroz are as follows:

              1.  Caverns of Kroz
              2.  Dungeons of Kroz
              3.  Kingdom of Kroz
              4.  Return to Kroz
              5.  Temple of Kroz
              6.  The Final Crusade of Kroz
              7.  The Lost Adventures of Kroz

Episodes 1-3 comprised "The Kroz Trilogy."  These episodes were later
redone in 1990, their names changing to "Caverns of Kroz II," "Dungeons of
Kroz II," and "Kingdom of Kroz II."  Since Kingdom of Kroz II had
significant map changes to 17 different levels, the original "Kingdom of
Kroz I" remained available for purchase to registered owners of "Kingdom of
Kroz II."

Episodes 3-6 comprised "The Super Kroz Trilogy."  These contained more
levels, more items, and more effects.  This trilogy was intended to complete
the Kroz series, but the letters kept pouring in, including one from
Patricia Baker, RI, who said, "I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and
was sorry tonight to finally find the Amulet."

So one final episode of Kroz was to be made, namely Episode 7, "The Lost
Adventures of Kroz."  This contained 75 new levels, and, as such, was sold
at the slightly steeper rate of $20.  As said earlier, however, the rates
were lowered if more episodes were purchased at once.  In early 1991, one
could buy the first six episodes for $35 total, or $45 for all seven.

"The Lost Adventures of Kroz" was the final episode to be completed.  At
one time, another episode had been planned for release in March 1991
entitled "The Underground Empire of Kroz," but this never saw the light of
day.  Apogee, along with the rest of the gaming community, started moving
on toward more ambitious projects.

Unlike most of Apogee's early games, the Kingdom of Kroz is still
commercially available from Apogee.  The episodes you'll get upon a $24.95
registration are the revised Kroz Trilogy, the Super Kroz Trilogy, and
the Lost Adventures.  You cannot buy the individual episodes for Kroz or
any other Apogee game any longer; Apogee stopped doing this in mid 1993.

[2.5.2]  Commander Keen

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Keen series:

Here's a short history of the Commander Keen games.  First, I'll list
all the games and their titles.  All of them were written by id
Software.

  1) Marooned on Mars    ---\
  2) The Earth Explodes     | ---> Invasion of the Vorticons
  3) Keen Must Die       ---/
3.5) Keen Dreams
  4) Secret of the Oracle    --\__  Goodbye Galaxy
  5) The Armageddon Machine  --/
  6) Aliens Ate My Babysitter

Episodes 1-3 are collectively called "Invasion of the Vorticons,"
and are published by Apogee Software.   This series of Commander Keen
was released on December 14th, 1990, according to Tom Hall, Apogee's
Creative Director, and at the time, Creative Director of id Software.

Episodes 4 and 5 are collectively called "Goodbye Galaxy," and are also
published by Apogee Software.  This series of Commander Keen was
released somewhere around June of 1991.  There was also a special CGA
edition of Keens 4-5 made.  The game is functionally exactly the same
as the standard EGA version of the game, but the graphics are in CGA.

Episode 6 is a "stand alone" game, and is entitled "Aliens Ate my
Babysitter."  This episode of Keen is distributed by FormGen.  It is
commercial software, and is available at your local software store
(such as CompUSA).  This is also sold by Apogee, but Apogee only
resells this product, we don't actually distribute it.  FormGen also
decided to put off-disk copy protection on the full version of this
game.  Furthermore, FormGen also has a playable 3 level commercial
demo available for perusal before purchase.  Apogee Software sells a
version of Keen 6 in CGA.  I do not know if FormGen sells the CGA
version of Keen 6 in the stores; it may only be available from Apogee
Software.  Check with FormGen for more details.

Keen Dreams has kind of an interesting story.  This is referred to as
the "Lost Episode" of Commander Keen.   I like to think of it as "Keen
Episode 3.5."  The reason for that is that Keen Dreams falls in between
Vorticons and Galaxy, both in terms of technology and story line.
Before the id guys actually formed id, the majority of them worked at
Softdisk, a computer software publisher in Shreveport, LA.  The
founding members of id Software left Softdisk to do the Vorticons
series of Keen for Apogee Software.  However, they were contractually
obligated to deliver another game to Softdisk, and since development
had started on the Galaxy series, they threw together a Keen game for
Softdisk, and Keen Dreams was born.  This game is not sold by Apogee
Software, nor does Apogee have anything at all to do with it.  You'd
need to contact Softdisk for any further information regarding Keen
Dreams.

Episodes 1, 3.5, 4, and the 3 level demo for Episode 6 are
the only ones that you are legally allowed to upload and download
anywhere.  Episodes 2, 3, 5, and the full version of Episode 6 are
commercial software, and should not appear on any BBS, online service,
or should otherwise be sold except for authorized sellers of the
games.

Here are the BBS filenames as currently available from Apogee for the
various Keen games from Apogee.

Keen 1 -> #1KEEN.ZIP
Keen 4 -> #4KEEN.ZIP
Keen 4 -> #4KEENC.ZIP (Special CGA Version)

I've seen the 3 level Aliens Demo available with the filename
#6K-DEMO.ZIP and K6DEMO.ZIP.  I've seen Keen Dreams available with
the filename KDREAMS.ZIP.  However, neither of these are Apogee
products, and I cannot vouch for the files' names.

If you played Keen 5, there was a screen that said something to the
effect of "Join us in December 1992 for the greatest Keen adventure
yet."  There was a picture of Keen smiling, with a Santa Claus hat on.
At the time, id Software was intending to do a third series of
Commander Keen, tentatively entitled "Commander Keen: The Universe is
Toast."  However, other projects came up (Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of
Destiny, and later, Doom).  At this time, there is no development
going on in the Commander Keen department.  There will probably be
more Commander Keen games by Apogee Software.  However, even if the
work were to commence on the game TODAY, it would still take about twelve
months to see the light of day.  The earliest development could start
on this game would be late in 1995, so I would not look for any new
Commander Keen games before the third quarter of 1996.

On a different note, Commander Keen, and artifacts from the Keen games have
found their way into other games.  Commander Keen is listed in the default
scoreboards of a handful of Apogee games, mentioned in the instructions of
one, and has made a few more prominent appearances, which are listed under
the "Cameos" section of this FAQ.

[2.5.3]  Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Wolfenstein series:

On May 5, 1992, Apogee Software released the shareware episode of Wolfenstein
3D, and has been distributing it in the shareware market since.  Apogee
is the official distributor of Wolfenstein 3D's original six episodes in the
shareware market.

Somewhere around September of 1992, FormGen Corp released Spear of Destiny.
This is a retail sequel to Wolfenstein 3D.  This game consisted of one episode
with 20 levels.  This game consists of some new wall art, a couple of new
objects, and new boss creatures.  This game is essentially the same as Wolf3D
generally, but is completely new in the level design aspect.  This game is
available in stores like CompUSA.  Apogee also resells this product, but is not
responsible for its distribution.  Apogee has to buy it from FormGen
like any other store would.  There is a two level playable demo floating around
for Spear of Destiny.  It's the same first two levels that appear in the full
version of the game.  It is not shareware; commercial demos are for the most
part non-interactive, however, this one *is* interactive, and since it bears
a close resemblance to Wolfenstein 3D, which is shareware, the SOD demo is
frequently mistaken for being shareware, which it is not.

There have been numerous editors and extra levels created by users for both
Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny.  With regard to Wolf3D, Apogee
respectfully requests that you not make or distribute any editors, extra
levels, or other add-ons that will work on the shareware episode.  If you
choose to make add-ons, please make these items for the registered version
only, and be aware that Apogee cannot support user-created items.

Sometime in mid/late 1993, id Software decided that they were going to publish
these same six original episodes in the retail market.  These are the same six
episodes that Apogee had been selling since May of 1992.  Since Apogee was at
that time not set up for retail distribution, id Software went with another
company called is GT Software.  This package is available in CompUSA and
contains the same six episodes that Apogee distributes.  Apogee has absolutely
nothing at all to do with this product.  The GT Software version of
Wolfenstein 3D is totally a GT product.  Apogee has no control over the
packaging, quality control, or price.

In May of 1994, FormGen Corporation released an update to Spear of Destiny.  It
was two new epsiodes and are available in the stores.  The collective name of
the product is "Spear of Destiny Mission Add-On Packs."  The new new epsiodes
each have their own individual titles, these being "Mission 2: Return to
Danger," and "Mission 3: Ultimate Challenge."  These are add-ons to Spear of
Destiny and have some new level graphics, some differently colored actors,
but is essentially more levels for Spear of Destiny.  These extra versions do
require that you have the first Spear of Destiny game (the original six Apogee
Wolf episodes are not required).  Neither Apogee Software nor id software
has anything to do with these add-on packs.  Neither Apogee nor id sells the
packs or supports it.  It is strictly a FormGen product.

id Software has also either written or released versions of Wolfenstein 3D for
other platforms over time.  Apogee Software has nothing to do with any
of them.  id Software holds the copyright to Wolfenstein 3D and can
license it to others for other platforms or do whatever they want with it.
These versions are listed for completeness' sake only.

The Super Nintendo version was released around Jan/Feb of 1994.  This was
published through a company called "Imagineer."  Due to Nintendo restrictions,
some elements of the game had to be removed.  These were, 1) all Nazi
references, 2) the dogs (replaced with rats), and 3) blood (replaced with
sweat).  This is still a good game, considering what it's programmed for.
There was a version released for the Atari Jaguar around August of 1994, and
this version is probably the best graphically of any version published.  When
you go up right against walls and the like, they do not become as blocky or
chunky, as compared to previous versions of Wolfenstein 3D.  This version was
published by Atari.  id also licensed Wolf3D so that it could be published
on the Macintosh computer.  This version was released in October 1994 and is
being distributed by MacPlay, a division of Interplay.  WolfMac is a
shareware title, and there is a shareware version of it available.  When you
register, you get something like 30 levels.  Again, Apogee has nothing to do
with these versions of Wolfenstein 3D; you would need to contact the various
companies, or id Software directly for more information on them.  There was
yet another version published in late 1994 by Vitesse, this version being done
for the Apple IIGS.  This brings the game full circle, as the original Castle
Wolfenstein was written for the Apple IIe.  The IIGS version was done by Burger
Bill Heinemann (as was the Mac version).

The premiere issue of Game Developer's Magazine stated that Apogee Software was
working on a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II," which was to be a totally
new game, with completely new actors, and new everything; the only thing the
same being the title Wolfenstein 3D.   This information is partially
incorrect; there is no such title under production at either Apogee or id
Software.  However, this was under production at Apogee for a while back in
early 1994, but this was dropped, and the project changed to "Rise of the
Triad."  This game is now available from Apogee Software.

[2.5.3.1]  "Call Apogee and say Aardwolf"

Joe Siegler's explanation of "Aardwolf":

"Call Apogee and say Aardwolf."  It's a sign that to this day is something
that I get asked about a lot.  This is a sign that appears on a wall in a
particularly nasty maze in Episode 2 Level 8 of Wolfenstein 3D.  The sign
was to be the goal in a contest Apogee was going to have, but almost
immediately after the game's release, a large amount of cheat and mapping
programs were released.  With these programs running around, we felt that
it would have been unfair to have the contest and award a prize.  The sign
was still left in the game, but in hindsight, probably should have been
taken out, since we still get calls now, almost three years after the game's
release.

Also, in a somewhat related issue, the registered version had letters after the
highest score in the score table in some revisions of the game.  These letters
were to be part of another contest that got scrapped before it got started,
where we were going to have people call in with their scores and tell us the
code; we'd then be able to verify their score.  However, with the cheat
programs out there, this got scrapped too.

[2.5.4]  Halloween Harry and Alien Carnage

Halloween Harry was written by Sub-Zero software, located in Australia.
Apogee is the game's distributor.  In October of 1993, Apogee released
v1.1 of Halloween Harry in the United States.  As with both Mystic Towers
and Wacky Wheels, the first American version was 1.1, not 1.0.  The reason
for this is that an incomplete version of the game was released overseas
as a cover program and referred to as v1.0.  Please note, however, that
these are not complete, finished versions of the games.

A month later, v1.2 of the game was released.  A year after that, Apogee
suggested a title change to "Alien Carnage."  Sub-Zero agreed.  Thus, in
early November of 1994, "Halloween Harry" was dropped from Apogee's
distribution, and "Alien Carnage" added.  Alien Carnage v1.0 is essentially
Halloween Harry v1.2 with a name change, price change, and episode
reorganization.  The shareware version of Alien Carnage (its first episode)
is Halloween Harry's episode three.  With the exception of this
reorganization, Alien Carnage consists of the same episodes as Halloween
Harry.  The shareware version of Halloween Harry is still legal to
distribute; however, Apogee prefers you distribute the shareware version of
Alien Carnage only, as this version has the new pricing information
screens.

}[2.5.5]  Rise of the Triad
}
}Back in early 1994, a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II" was under
}production.  This was dropped, and the project became "Rise of the Triad," or,
}as it is casually known, "ROTT."  Version 1.0 was released on December 21,
}1994; in February 1995, versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.2a were released.  The disk
}based registered version was available starting in late February; the regular
}CD based registered version started shipping in March, and the Site License CD
}started shipping in April.
}
}Tom Hall, the creative director for Rise of the Triad, dubbed the Rise of the
}Triad team the "Developers of Incredible Power" (DIP?).  ROTT was the first
}release of the Developers of Incredible Power, under that name, although most
}of the members of this team had worked on previous Apogee projects.
}
}One of the curiosities of ROTT is that the actors in the game were digitized
}and voiced by members of Apogee.  The following chart shows who was scanned
}and who was sampled to create each ROTT character.

[2.5.6]  Paganitzu and Realms of Chaos

About a year before Keith Schuler wrote Paganitzu for Apogee, he wrote
another game called Chaganitzu for Softdisk.  These two games were almost
identical, containing the same characters and story and so forth.  Unlike
Paganitzu, however, Chaganitzu does not adapt to the speed of your computer,
making it virtually unplayable on fast computers.

Following his success with Apogee's Paganitzu, Schuler began a sequel
in early 1992 entitled, "Paganitzu II: the Bloodfire Pendant."  Later, it
went through a name change to "Alabama Smith and the Bloodfire Pendant."
Still later, its name became "Realms of Chaos," losing all its Paganitzu
references in the process.

Realms of Chaos was originally supposed to be a 16 color EGA game, slated
for a 1994 release, but, with the increasing popularity of VGA games, it was
decided that time should be spent converting Realms of Chaos to a 256 color
VGA game.  Realms of Chaos should be available from Apogee sometime in the
second quarter of 1995.

Contrary to what one might think, the 3D Realms project "Ruins: Return of the
Gods" was not ever associated with Paganitzu, even in its early days.

[3.1]  Games

Please note that this information is constantly changing, especially when new
games are added to the list of Apogee products.  Some of the information given
here could become out of date rather quickly.

[3.1.1]  What games are currently available from Apogee?

A list of Apogee games follows. The filename given is the file -- on
CompuServe, BBS's, and the Internet -- which contains the first episode of
each game.  Note that on the Internet, the filenames do not contain the
leading '#' mark.  On CompuServe, there are no numbers or punctuation in
the filenames at all.

The price given is the cost of the *complete* game with all episodes. The "Ep"
field contains the number of episodes in the complete version. The "Ver"
field contains the latest version number of the game.  "Gph" is the best
graphics mode that the game utilizes.

 + - Spear of Destiny and Aliens Ate My Babysitter are commercial pieces of
     software by FormGen Corporation.  id Software wrote both of them, and
     FormGen distributes them.  Apogee only resells these titles.  There are
     demos available from FormGen for these games, but they are not Apogee
     titles, and Apogee does not distribute the demos for these games.
     Blake Stone: Planet Strike is also distributed by FormGen, but written
     by Apogee.  There is no demo or shareware version of the game.

 * - There is an optional CGA mode in Paganitzu.
     There are CGA versions of Keen: Galaxy and Keen: Aliens.
     There is a "Monster Bash Lite" version of this game, which contains the
            first three levels of the shareware episode.  Apogee does not
            distribute this version anymore, but it is still legal to pass
            around.  If it still exists on an FTP site or BBS, its filename
            will probably be "1mblite.zip".
     There is a smaller registered version of Wacky Wheels, which contains
            only the first three sets of tracks, available for $24.95.
     There is a smaller registered version of Boppin called Basic Boppin which
            contains only the first two episodes of the game, is available for
            $19.95.  This version does not contain the level editor, nor the
            ability to play user-created levels.  The $29.95 version is
            called Super Boppin, and contains the complete game and level
            editor.
     There are several versions of Rise of the Triad available.  The regular
            registered is $29.95, and contains 32 regular levels and 30
            comm-bat zones.  The power pack add-on contains 10 extra comm-bat
            zones, a random level generator, and BMP and WAV files from the
            game.  Super Triad is for CD only, costs $34.95, and contains
            everything in the regular registered, plus the power pack, plus
            more BMP and WAV files, plus some extra Apogee shareware games.
            The Site License version is also for CD only, costs $89.95,
            includes 10 more comm-bat zones, a signed site license agreement,
            and eleven command cards.  For people to play a networked game
            using the registered version, each member must have either their
            own registered versions, or a site license version owned between
            them.

 ^ - The full titles of the Keen games are "Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!"
            and "Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons."
     Alien Carnage used to be known as "Halloween Harry."
}    The shareware episode of Rise of the Triad is also known as "Rise of the
}           Triad: the HUNT Begins"; the registered episodes are also known as
}           "Rise of the Triad: Dark War".

 ~ - These games contain some measure of graphic violence, and may be
            unsuitable for young game players.
     Of these, Rise of the Triad, Blake Stone, and Wolfenstein 3D have
            official notices about violent content.
     Boppin v1.0 has an option to minimize the violence somewhat.  Boppin v1.1
            does not have violent content unless a command line parameter is
            given.  (See the cheats section.)
     Rise of the Triad has adjustable violence levels.

 = - The file specifications for Rise of the Triad are available as
            ROTSPEC1.ZIP in any official Apogee area.
   - RTSMaker, a RemoteRidicule sound editor for Rise of the Triad, is
            available as RTSMAKER.ZIP in any official Apogee area.

[3.1.2]  The games are too big to download!  Are there "split" versions?

Most of the larger games have split versions available from Software
Creations, the Internet, etc.  Again, the filenames have a leading '#'
mark except on the Internet.

}[3.1.5]  Which of Apogee's games are good?
}
}What follows is a series of evaluations for each game.  Ratings are given on
}a scale of 1-10, 5 being the minimum "good" rating.  (A rating of 10 does not
}mean perfection, for in the gaming world, perfection is never achieved;
}someone will always come out with something better later.)
}
}Ratings are given for different categories.  For all but the last category,
}the ratings are my own personal ratings.  The final category contains the
}results of the rating system, whereby game players far and wide may contact
}me via Internet email with their own evaluations of each game.  To send
}your own evaluations, please see the instructions and rules in the next
}section.
}
}For the "Grph" field, the letter indicates (T)ext, (C)GA, (E)GA, (V)GA,
}or (S)VGA.  "Snd" is sound.  "Msc" is music.  The "Enem" field rates how
}unique and interesting the enemies are.  The "Lvl" field rates the design of
}the levels.  The "Game" field rates the gameplay, or how well the game "works"
}as a game.  The "Overall" field is not an average, but rather how lastingly
}enjoyable the game is to play.  The "Vote Results" field gives two values:
}the first is the average rating from the voting system; the second is the
}number of people who have given ratings for that particular game.

}[3.1.5.1]  Rules of the voting system
}
}To send in your votes, send mail to one of:  rink@unh.edu, ss1@christa.unh.edu,

}or stoddard@ctron.com.  Include something on the order of "Apogee Votes" in
}the subject line.  The body of the message should contain one or more Apogee
}games that you're voting on, one vote per game.  Your vote will be a rating
}from 1 through 10, inclusive.  Use whole numbers -- the decimals in the
}results are given for accuracy.  Include one vote per line, something like
}this:
}               10     Duke Stone
}               8      Commander Logan: Call of the Vorticons
}               6      Mystic Wheels 3D
}               4      Monuments of Destiny: Goodbye Triad!
}
}The games you can vote on are those listed in the above section ONLY.  Don't
}vote on non-Apogee games, discontinued Apogee games, or beta versions of yet
}to be released Apogee games.  (Note, however, that while "Keen: Aliens" and
}"Spear of Destiny" are not, technically, Apogee games, you can still vote on
}them.)
}
}So what will your votes do?  Your votes will be averaged in with all the other
}votes.  The average and the total number of voters will be listed in the
}ratings section.  Your votes will be taken into consideration for the next
}release of the Apogee FAQ, and, from then, forever after.  There is no need
}to resend votes unless you want to change a vote.

[3.2]  Past projects

[3.2.1]  What Apogee games are no longer supported?

Apogee no longer takes orders, technical support calls, or offers any other
form of support for the following games:  The Thor Trilogy, SuperNova, Beyond
the Titanic, Word Whiz, and Trivia Whiz.  Apogee retains the copyright on
these games, but not much else.  Apogee requests that these games no longer
be distributed.

There are three games that Apogee does not distribute, sell, or register
any more.  These three are Jumpman Lives!, Star Trek Trivia, and Star Trek:TNG
Trivia.  Apogee retains no copyright on these and requests that the shareware
episodes (if they exist) on any Apogee site be removed from distribution.

[4.2.3]  Cameos

Frequently, the star of one Apogee game will make a cameo appearance in
another.  Or, sometimes, someone from the real world shows up.  A list of
such cameos follows.  Appearances of Apogee characters in the default
scoreboards of games are not mentioned here, however, since there would be
too many to list.

      WARNING: much of the fun of these games is running across these
      things during play.  Do not read this section if you want to be
      surprised!

[5.1]  The Shareware Episodes

[5.1.1]  Software Creations BBS

Apogee's home BBS is the Software Creations BBS.  There are over a hundred
lines.  Apogee's games are released here first before anywhere else in
the world.  The numbers are:

    (508) 365-2359 2400 baud
    (508) 368-7036 @ 9600-14.4k v.32bis
    (508) 365-4035 @ 28.8k v.fc / v.34

[5.1.2]  Anonymous FTP

The official FTP site for Apogee is ftp.uml.edu.  uml has several mirror sites
which can be used in the event that uml is down or too crowded.  Mirrors are
generally updated on a daily basis.  A list of sites follows:

[5.1.3]  CompuServe

Type "GO APOGEE" at a ! prompt.  Remember that on CompuServe, the filenames
do not match those in the filenames list given previously; on CompuServe,
Apogee games have neither the leading episode number nor a version number
embedded in the filename.

[5.1.4]  America On Line

Use the keyword "APOGEE" to go to Apogee's forum.

[5.1.5]  Fidonet

If you are a Fidonet SysOp, you can get Apogee's games on the Fido Filebone.
Talk to your local filebone hub about the four Apogee areas.  See FILEBONE.NA
for more information.  Send netmail to 1:124/9006 for more information on
these areas.

[5.2]  The Registered Episodes

The registered versions of the software are the complete versions, and, as
they are not shareware, cannot legally exist on public BBS's or FTP sites.
The registered versions of the software must be purchased directly from
Apogee or from one of Apogee's dealers.

In many of Apogee's newer games, a DEALERS.EXE executable is archived with
the game.  This is an executable readme containing a list of the foreign
dealers that sell Apogee's software.

[5.2.1]  Ordering information

To order directly from Apogee, call 1-800-APOGEE1.  The line is open 24 hours
a day.  They'll need to know what disk size you desire, the best graphics
mode you are able to run (CGA, EGA, VGA, SVGA), and whether you have an XT,
286, 386, 486, or Pentium.  Note that some games have minimum CPU and
graphics requirements.  Also note that Apogee's VGA games come only on high
density disks.

Use the ORDER.FRM file, which comes with virtually all of Apogee's games, if
you want to send in an order by mail.  Send it to:

    Apogee Software, Ltd.
    P.O. Box 496389,
    Garland TX 75049-6389

Or, you can fax a copy of your order to (214) 278-4670.  Please include a
return fax number if you make use of this facility.

[5.2.2]  Software Creations BBS

}If you like, you can download the full registered versions of any Apogee game
}from Software Creations by using a credit card for payment.  (Apogee will mail
you the game manual and catalog, which you will receive a few days later.)
}This only applies to disk-based versions of the games, though, as the CD
}versions are too large to download.  See the previous Software Creations
section for information on calling Software Creations.

[5.2.3]  What combination deals does Apogee offer?

[6.1]  Things to try first

If you have a program with an Apogee game not starting correctly, there are a
few things you can try.  First, make sure your system meets the hardware
requirements of the game.  If they don't, you probably can't run the game
without upgrading your hardware.

Second, make sure you have the most recent version of the game.  Many older
versions of games have bugs that are fixed in the most recent versions.

Third, if there is a XXXXHELP.EXE file that came with the game, read it.
(Most registered Apogee games have such a file on the first game disk;
with shareware versions, you might find it there and possibly in the directory
the game was installed to as well.)  This file will contain numerous common
technical problems with their solutions.  There are plans underway to make
a file available on-line which will contain all the current versions of
the technical support files in them.

If the game is failing to start due to insufficient memory, you can try
removing TSRs, or booting "clean."  With MS-DOS 6.0 or greater, you can do
this by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the system is booting.
This causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be bypassed.  If you
are running a memory manager, try removing the manager altogether; this
seems to fix most problems Apogee games have with EMS/XMS memory.  Additional
suggestions on how to free up memory may be in the XXXXHELP.EXE file.

Also, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some
games, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the
game.  Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.

If you problem is your Soundblaster card (or a Soundblaster emulating card),
then the problem may be the settings on the card or the BLASTER environment
variable.  Check the section on that subject below.

With regard to drive compression, Apogee has tested their entire product
line with Stacker 3.1, Stacker 4.0, and MS-DOS 6.22's DriveSpace.  The
}products all worked fine, with the following exceptions:   Monster Bash
}suffered a slowdown using DriveSpace.  The install procedure for the Rise
}of the Triad CD version 1.2a does not work under any drive compression
}program, but the game may be installed manually and will run fine.

If you've tried everything and still can't get an Apogee game to work
correctly, contact Apogee's technical support services.  These are listed
under "Contacting Apogee."

[6.2]  Setting the BLASTER environment variable

This section may be useful if you are having problems with sound or music in
an Apogee game.
 
Apogee games that use Sound Blasters look at the BLASTER environment variable
to figure out where to send its sound output.  Check to make sure that you
have the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This code is an example,
and probably isn't exactly what you need to put in your system.
 
NOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of
      cards.  For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE 32.  The
      minimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters.  The other
      three may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.
      Please read this entire section to see if you need any of them.  If you
      are using a clone card, or some card that's not a "true" Sound Blaster,
      then you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3 P330 H6 E620
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |_______ AWE 32 Only Parameter
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |__________ "High" DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |_______________ MIDI Port
 |    |     |    |  |  |__________________ Type of Card
 |    |     |    |  |_____________________ DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |________________________ Interrupt
 |    |     |_____________________________ Port Address
 |    |___________________________________ Environment Variable
 |________________________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).
If you have a space in there, your system will read the parameter incorrectly,
and it will not be recognized by our games.

Now, these may not (most likely not) be the same for your board, because the
Port Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by adjusting "jumpers" on
your sound board.  Some newer cards have this information controlled by
software, please consult your card's manual for more information on how to set
these things.  You should also check your manual if you are unclear as to how
to tell what settings your card is set at.  The information *IS* important, so
it's recommended that you know precisely what the settings are.  If you are
using a card that "emulates" the Sound Blaster (such as the Gravis UltraSound
through software, or the PAS16), you should check your card's manual on how to
set the card for Sound Blaster emulation.

For PORT ADDRESS, it's almost always 220.  That seems to be the default for
most sound cards out there, and unless you know you've switched it away from
220, it's a safe bet it's still there.

The INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system.  Mystic Towers
and games prior to Raptor require that your IRQ be set at 7 or less.  Apogee
does not recommend using IRQ2, as it causes problems.

The DMA CHANNEL sometimes causes problems if it isn't set to 1, which is the
usual default.  If it is not set to one, some Apogee games may lock up.

The TYPE OF CARD should be 1 if you have an older Sound Blaster, or a Sound
Blaster emulating card.  Use 3 if you have a newer plain Sound Blaster.  Use
2 for an older Sound Blaster Pro.  Use 4 for a newer Sound Blaster Pro.

The MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has
MIDI capabilites.  If so, this is where you define what MIDI port you are
using.  330 seems to be the default, so if you have a MIDI card, and you
haven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably where it still
is.

The HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Sound Blaster 16
cards.  This is not the same as the standard DMA channel, this is a different
one.  This is only used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing
16 bit Sound Blaster sounds.  By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know
that it's something else, it's probably still 5.

The E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative
Labs AWE 32 sound card.  If you have one of these, this parameter will have
been set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the
card.  Check your AWE 32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what
this parameter is used for.

[7]  Cheats
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Apogee has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games, both
}documented and undocumented.  Sometimes these cheats are available in all
}versions of the game; other times they are only available in the registered.
>From 1987 to around May 1993, Apogee games came with a hint sheet, which
often contained cheats in them.  From May 1993 to December 1993, Apogee games
were shipped with a XXXXHINT.EXE file, which had the same text as the old
hint sheets.  Beginning in 1994, the XXXXHINT.EXE files are done away with
too; the information is now contained in the actual game manuals.  Sometimes,
}however, cheats are mentioned in XXXXHELP.EXE files which previously
}contained strictly technical support information.

The cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.
The customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or
game manual that comes with the game.  Some of the games also have a debugging
mode, which is not generally documented.  Their original purpose is to aid in
the beta testing of the game.  Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is
left intact, available for the regular game-player to use.  Finally, there are
technical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to
correct some technical problems.

[7.1]  Complete cheat list

This section contains a variety of cheats from various Apogee games.
Actually, in the words of Joe Siegler, it's "the first comprehensive cheat
[list] ever published for all Apogee titles."

Note that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by Apogee,
the debug keys are not.  If you use the debug keys, Apogee cannot provide
any support, since this alters game performance to a state where their
standard support comments and issues might not apply.  In short, neither
Apogee or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug
keys.  (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing
happening, save where expressly noted below.)

+ Customer Cheat - Type in each cheat code, letter by letter, to get the
                   desired effect.  You can type in either the "code" or
                   the "alternate".  Note that for the codes, the slash
                   is a backslash, not a forward slash.  The codes are not
                   case sensitive.  The "dipstick" code must be given before
                   any others, to enable the other cheats.  Note that any
                   cheats marked by an asterisk work only in the registered
                   version of the game.  All other cheats work in both the

[Boppin]
 
+ Customer Cheat - The following cheats are available:
 
        From the main menu, these are available in both the shareware and
        registered versions of the game:
 
                [ctrl] [V] - gives a slide show of all episodes (while the
                             show is playing, you can hit the left and right
                             arrow keys to go to the previous and next levels,
                             or esc to quit)
                [ctrl] [T] - sound testing dialogue
 
        During gameplay, the following are available in both the shareware and
        registered versions of the game:
 
                [ctrl] [B] - display the mystery spot
                [ctrl] [L] - moves you to the next level, at the expense of
                             a life; will not work during the final battle
        [shift] [ctrl] [L] - moves you back a level; this will not work on
                             either the first level of an episode, or the
                             final battle
 
        During gameplay, the following are available provided the password
}       "TOYS" is given to activate them.  These work only in the registered
        version:
 
                [ctrl] [F] - go to the final battle for the episode
                 [alt] [H] - delivers one maximum hit during the final battle
               [ctrl] [F5] - add one credit to player one (nine maximum)
               [ctrl] [F8] - add one credit to player two (nine maximum)
                [1] or [!] - set lives for player one to zero *
                [2] or [@] - set lives for player two to zero *
 
        * These two cheats may not work if the shift key is used for a button.

        Finally, in v1.1 of Boppin, the command line parameter "blood" may
        be used to access the violence mode from v1.0.


[Wacky Wheels]

+ Customer Cheat - The following command line parameters can be used in
                   both the shareware and registered versions of the game:

          /2       Fast gameplay.
          /3       Really fast gameplay.
          /debug   Create a ERR.LOG file as you play.
          turbo    Activate the turbo key [brake]+[fire].
          jump     Activate the jump key [brake]+[accelerate].

   Additionally, you can specify ONE of the following three weapon parameters:
 
           hog      Get 99 hedgehogs.
           ice      Get 99 ice cubes.
           fire     Get 99 fireballs.

}+ Miscellaneous - Hitting [F10] during game play will write the screen out to
}                  a PCX file.
}
}+ Misc Command Line Parameter - "now" will start the game directly from the
}                                main menu.


[Mystic Towers]

+ Customer Cheat - Cheats are activated by typing "BALDRIC" during a level.
                   Once actived, your score is reset to zero, and you can
                   press the following key combos to achieve what is listed:

   [lshift] R xx - where xx is a number of a room to jump to (01-45)
      [lshift] H - to get maximum health, also food and drink
      [lshift] K - to get all keys except the end tower key
      [lshift] W - to get full weapons
      [lshift] C - to get ten coins

                   Only the health cheat works in the shareware version; the
                   rest require the registered version.


[Hocus Pocus]

+ Customer Cheat - Type these:

                 FEELGOOD - full health
                    BLAKE - both keys
                   BANANA - laser shots (registered version only)
                    QUARK - rapid fire (registered version only)


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

+ Customer Cheat - The backspace key will restore all your energy and give
                   you a death ray, at the cost of all your money.  This
                   will only work in the registered version.

+ Debug mode - Set the environment variable "S_HOST" to the value "CASTLE"
               at the DOS prompt by typing "SET S_HOST=CASTLE" (it must be
               in caps).  Then, when you play Raptor, you become completely
               invincible, and have all the weapons at your disposal.

+ Warp - There is a level warp built into the game, so you can see any level
         you want at any time.  What you need to do is to get to the screen
         where you see the level selection (Bravo Sector, etc...).  The warp
         combination is a 2 key entry.  The keys are not to be pressed at the
         same time.  Note that you cannot use the level warp unless debug
         mode (see above) is active.

  Key 1 - Z, X, or Y (Z is Episode 1, X is Episode 2, and Y is Episode 3)
  Key 2 - Any key between Q and O on the keyboard.  Q is Level 1, and O is
          Level 9.

  This works in both the shareware and registered versions.  Note that if you
  try and warp to a registered episode from the shareware version, it will
  crash the game.


[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike]

+ Customer Cheat - [J] [A] [M] [Enter] - These keys are to be pressed one at a
                   time.  When all are pressed, the message "Now you're
                   Jammin'" appears, and you will be given all keys, and you
                   will get 100% health.  Your score will also be taken to 0.
                   This will only work on the registered version of the game.

+ Debug Mode - Command Line Parameters

  POWERBALL - Enables debug keys.  This also requires that you hold down the
              left and right shift keys during the JAM Logo intro.  Don't
              hold them down until the white letters start to appear.
              Once the PC-13 screen is loaded, you can let go.  You will hear
              a "ching" sound during the intro when debug mode has been
              successfully enabled.  The "ching" sound will only happen if
              you have a sound card. If you have a PC speaker, you won't hear
              this.
       TICS - Display TIC INFO in score area.
      MUSIC - Enable music test mode: [backspace] [arrows] changes music.
      RADAR - Displays a rotating overhead view during gameplay.  Please note
              that this REALLY slows the game down, to the point of being
              unplayable.

              These cheat keys can be use during gameplay only if you invoked
              the program with the "powerball" parameter:

       [backspace] W - Warp to level ([shift] [W] loads the default map)
       [backspace] D - Player invisible (dumb objects)
       [backspace] G - God mode
       [backspace] I - Item cheat
       [backspace] M - Memory info
       [backspace] P - Pause screen
       [backspace] Q - Fast quit
       [backspace] A - Add Actors to AutoMapper.
       [backspace] U - Unlock all floors
       [backspace] O - Show hidden walls on auto mapper
       [backspace] E - Quick Win Mission
       [backspace] B - Border color
       [backspace] C - Count objects
       [backspace] F - Facing spot
       [backspace] H - Hurt self (only if not in God mode)
       [backspace] S - Slow motion
       [backspace] V - Extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do
                                   nothing for most users)
  [backspace] [home] - Dec sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgup] - Inc sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
   [backspace] [end] - Dec ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgdn] - Inc ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
       [backspace] + - Add shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] - - Dec shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] ] - Inc shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] [ - Dec shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [shift] [tab] - Show full automap containing all live actors.

     These cheat keys can be used during gameplay:

           [6] [7] - Collect all bonus items (gold, ammo, health, etc).
           [7] [8] - Kill all actors.
           [6] [8] - Collect all bonus items and kill all actors.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters - These aren't really debug codes, or

       assisting customers who might be having problems running the game.

[Duke Nukem II]

+ Customer Cheat - For the registered version only, the following two codes
                   can be used during gameplay.  Please note that all three
                   letters have to be pressed at the same time.

  [E] [A] [T] - health is restored to maximum, but score is reset to zero
  [N] [U] [K] - get a random weapon, plus all inventory required to finish
                the current level


[Alien Carnage]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [B] [I] [G] all at the same time will give you
                   full health and jetpack power.

+ Debug mode - The following debug keys work for version 1.1 of Halloween
               Harry only:

               [ctrl] [R] [E] [N] - Gives you all weapons, and activates
                                    god mode for several seconds.
                        [alt] [L] - Level warp.  Type the number of the
                                    episode (1-4), followed by the number of
                                    the level (1-5).  Illegal input will dump
                                    you to DOS.  This can not be used in the
                                    shareware version to access levels in the
                                    registered version.
                        [alt] [=] - Change location within a level.  Type
                                    coordinates after this code; illegal
                                    input will probably crash the game.

+ Tech Parameter - Pressing these four keys at the same time will show you the
                   coordinates you are at on the level.  This serves no real
                   function on its own, but it is used by Apogee's Game Hint
                   Line sometimes to locate a player in a level.  The keys are
                   [ctrl] [alt] [rshift] [F12]

+ Misc Command Line Parameter - "skip" will start the game directly from the
                                main menu.


[Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [I] [L] [M] all at the same time, will give you
                   both keys, and will give you 100% health.  It will also
                   take your score to zero.  This cheat will work in both the
                   shareware and the registered version.

+ Debug mode -

  The debug mode is activated with a different command line parameter
  depending on what version of the game you have.

  v1.0  -> -next
           Once in the game, press [ctrl] [tab] [enter] to activate.

  v1.1+ -> -goobers
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Spear -> -debugmode
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Once activated, these are the keys you can use.

  [tab] [Q] - Quit
  [tab] [W] - Warp to level xx
  [tab] [E] - Exit to next level
  [tab] [T] - Debug info in memory
  [tab] [I] - Free items
  [tab] [O] - Map of level (only works in beta versions of Wolf3D)
  [tab] [S] - Slow motion
  [tab] [F] - Position info
  [tab] [G] - God mode (no damage)
  [tab] [H] - Hurt yourself
  [tab] [X] - Extra stuff (???)
  [tab] [C] - Statistics
  [tab] [V] - Add extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do nothing
                              for most users except maybe increase or decrease
                              the game speed.)
  [tab] [B] - Change border color
  [tab] [M] - Memory map
  [tab] [N] - No clipping (walk through walls)
              (This works only in Wolf3D v1.0 shareware.  This mode can cause
               really bad things to happen to the game, including corrupting
               itself, which is why it was taken out.)

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters are the same as in Blake Stone, except
  VERSION, SYSTEM, and ENABLEGP do nothing in Wolf3D.

+ Misc Command Line Parameter - "NOWAIT" will start the game directly from
                                the main menu.

+ Note 1: If you press [B] [A] [T] all at once, you'll get a message wondering
          why you're trying to cheat, since this is the old Keen Galaxy cheat
          code.

+ Note 2: For Spear only, if you do nothing in the game for 30 seconds, BJ
          will either cross his eyes or stick his tongue out at you.  It
          happens quickly, so you have to watch carefully.


[Bio Menace]

+ Customer Cheat - [C] [A] [T] - During gameplay, you can press these three
                   letters at the same time, and you will receive the machine
                   gun, 99 ammo, & 99 grenades.  This works only in the
                   registered version.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters -

            COMP - Turn on SVGA compatibility
            NOAL - Disable Adlib sound card detection
          NOJOYS - Disable joystick detection
         NOMOUSE - Disable mouse detection
      HIDDENCARD - Disable video card detection

+ Other Notes - The following secret weapons are available in both the
                shareware and registered versions:

    Super Plasma Bolt - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit fire; this causes one hit point of damage.
      Fireball Attack - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit fire.
      Electron Shield - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit the jump key.
  Invincibility Burst - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit the down arrow.


[Monster Bash]

+ Customer Cheat - In the registered version only, you can press the [Z] and
                   [F10] keys down simultaneously to receive five lives.  Hold
                   down [Z] first; since the [F10] key, by itself, has meaning
                   in the game, the cheat won't work if you push both down at
                   the same time and the [F10] is the first to register.


[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy! and Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing the [B] [A] [T] keys all at once will give you 99
                   shots, an extra life, and all the gems.  This does not work
                   on early versions of Aliens Ate My Babysitter.

+ Debug Mode - Pressing [A] [2] [enter] all at once will activate debug mode.
               Once activated, these keys will perform the following
               functions:

               [F10] [G] God mode
               [F10] [I] Free items
               [F10] [J] Jump cheat  (Note that you will not be able to jump
                                      down while the jump cheat is activated)
               [F10] [N] No clipping (Be careful.  If you fall off the bottom
                                      of the level, you'll die, even if you
                                      are in God Mode.)
               [F10] [Y] View hidden areas in the level.
               [F10] [B] Set border color (1-15)
               [F10] [C] Show number of active/inactive objects in the level
               [F10] [D] Record a demo
               [F10] [E] End the current level
               [F10] [M] Display memory usage
               [F10] [S] Slow motion
               [F10] [T] Sprite test
               [F10] [V] Add 0-8 VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this
                                       will do nothing for most users)
               [F10] [W] Warp to any level
               [F10] [Y] Reveal hidden areas


[Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons]

+ Customer Cheat - Either of these cheats will work with either the shareware
                   or registered versions of the game.  The key combinations
                   need to be pressed at the same time.

}      [C] [T] [space] - Gives pogostick, all keycards, and full ammo.
         [shift] [tab] - Pass through an unplayed level on world map.

+ Debug mode - [G] [O] [D] - pressing all three of these at the same time
               will put you in god mode, and will give you a "jump cheat,"
               which means when you press "jump," you fly.


[Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [C] [0] [F10] down simultaneously will give you
                   a full health and bombs.  This cheat only works once
                   per game.

+ Debug mode - Pressing [tab] [del] [F12] at once activates debug mode.  The
               debug keys are:

               [F10] [G] - God mode
               [F10] [W] - Warp
               [F10] [M] - Display memory usage statistics

+ Command Line Parameter - Give "apogee" on the command line when starting
                           up Cosmo.  The effects of this are many.  One,
                           the game will not recognize your old high
                           scores or saved games.  (The high scores will
                           be reset to those of Simpsons' characters until
                           you exit and re-enter the program normally.)
                           In this mode, if you die quickly enough after
                           entering a level, you'll be invincible from then
                           on, to everything but pits on the bottom of
                           each level.


[Duke Nukem I]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [backspace] [pgdn] at the same time will give you
                   all keys and full gun power.  This can be used in either
                   the shareware or registered version of the game.

+ Debug mode - To activate, you must enter "asp" on the command line, and it
               must be in lower case.  Once activated, you can press these
               key combinations inside the game.  All must be pressed
               simultaneously.

               [G] [O] [D] - Full health & all items
               [G] [O] [W] - Level Warp.  This isn't a real warp; it will
                             just take you to the next level.  You need to
                             keep on using it to progress through the levels.


[Major Stryker]

+ Customer Cheat - The cheats here are a bit more complicated than in other
                   games.  There is a two step procedure to active the cheat
                   mode.  (This cheat mode only works in the registered
                   version.  It does nothing in the shareware version.)

                   Step 1 - Type [C] [H] [E] [A] [T] at the Main Title Screen.
                            All keys need to be pressed one at a time.  When
                            you get it, you'll see the message that says
                            "Cheat Active" (it really isn't yet).
                   Step 2 - During the game, hold down the [backspace] key,
                            and then press the [H] & [S] keys at the same
                            time.  When you are successful, you'll see a
                            message that says "Cheat Mode On" (it is now).
                            You can hit these three keys again to turn the
                            cheat mode off.

                  Once activated, you can press these keys to activate various
                  options.  Please note that you must hold down the [tab] key
                  first before pressing the others, or it won't work.

                  [tab] [O] - Fire Options
                  [tab] [R] - Rapid Fire
                  [tab] [S] - Shield Options


[Crystal Caves]

+ Customer Cheat - All keys need to be pressed at the same time:

                   [X] [T] [R] [A] - Gives you max ammo.
                   [N] [E] [X] [T] - Lets you warp to any level.

+ Debug mode - Pressing [Z] [E] [U] [S] at the same time will put you into
               God mode and will let you activate the other debug mode key,
               which is [G].  Pressing that will reverse the gravity in the
               game.


[Secret Agent]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing these key combinations at the same time will
                   activate the functions listed.  This will work with either
                   the shareware or registered versions of the game.

                   [U] [V] [K] - Gives you 25 ammo.

                   [P] [J] [X] - God Mode
               [B] [O] [N] [D] - Warp


[Math Rescue]

+ Customer Cheat - These cheats will work in either the shareware or the
                   registered versions of the game.  Key combinations have to
                   be pressed at the same time.

                   [E] [L] [M] - Gives you lids and slime.
                   [P] [A] [M] - Level warp.  When you hit this combination,
                                 the game will freeze.  Press a number here,
                                 and you will be taken to that level.  You
                                 will not be able to see the number when you
                                 are typing it.

+ Tech Parameter - Pressing the [+] or [-] keys will speed up or slow down the

                   versions of the game.

                   [L] [Z]  - Warp.  When you type this, the screen will
                              freeze.  Enter the level number you want to go
                              to.  You will not be able to see the number
                              when you are typing it.
                   [P] [S]  - Gives you slime.

[Dark Ages]

+ Customer Cheat - Press [F10] to activate the cheat mode in either the
                   shareware or registered versions of the game.  This

                   [backspace] - Reduce extra health requirement to 5 coins.
                           [+] - Rapid fire.


[Paganitzu]

                   screen.  When you are there, press these three keys at the

                   screen where you can enter a number.  The numbers you can
                   enter and their functions are listed below, and they will
                   work with either the shareware or registered versions of
                   the game.

             325 - Gives you 99 lives.
             589 - Goes to the end-game sequence.

[Arctic Adventure]

                   time will give you all the keys, the boat, infinite ammo,
                   and infinite pick axes.  This will work with either the
                   shareware or registered version of the game.

[Monuments of Mars]

+ Customer Cheat - To activate the cheat mode, you need to press [capslock],
                   and then press the combination of [shift] [.].  Once
                   you've done that, you can press [pgdn] to advance a level.
                   This will work in either the shareware or registered
                   versions of the game.


[The Kroz Series]

+ Customer Cheat - To activate the cheat mode, you need to press either [!]
                   or [X].  This depends on which version you're playing, so

[7.2]  Hex editing

Editing saved game files is one of the finer methods of cheating.  Below are
the specs for the saved game files for some Apogee games.  To make use of
these specs, you'll need a hex editor (an editor, as opposed to a text
editor, which allows you to directly edit a binary file), and a small dose
of know-how.  If you are not comfortable with computers in general, it is
not recommended that you attempt to cheat in this manner; mistakes editing
these saved game files may cause unpredictable results.  Naturally, neither
Apogee nor I take responsibility for any damage caused by manually editing
saved game files.


[Wacky Wheels]

Edit the WACKY.CFG file:
      872H - number of laps, in longints (back up three and use those four
             bytes; remember that longints, integers, and words have
             reversed bytes).
      876H - Difficulty level (1=amateur, 2=pro, 3=champ).
      882H - Your points.
      886H - Opponent's points.
      88AH - Opponent's points.
      88EH - Opponent's points.
      892H - Opponent's points.
      896H - Opponent's points.
      89AH - Opponent's points.
      89EH - Opponent's points.
      87AH - Course group (bronze, silver, etc).
      87EH - Course number (1-5).
      8C3H - Number of porcupines.
      957H - Horsepower of your engine (1=12HP, 2=6HP).

      Changing your character type is slightly more complicated.  First,
      edit location 86AH as follows, remembering your old character number.
             0=Uno,   1=Sultan, 2=Morris, 3=Peggles,
             4=Razer, 5=Ringo,  6=Blombo, 7=Tigi
      At location 8A2H should be the number of your old character.
      Somewhere between 8A6H and 8BEH should be your new character number.
      Switch those bytes, so the one with the new character number has the
      old one in it, and your character number has the new number in it.

}[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]
}
}With a hex editor, change bytes 27h and 28h of a Raptor saved game file
}(char????.fil) to the value FF.  When you load this saved game, you'll have
}a few million dollars to spend on equipment.  If you don't have a hex editor,
}there are some programs available that do this for you.  The most common
}is RapCheat, available in various game cheat archives.

}[7.3]  Secrets and other fun things
}
}Frequently, game programmers will embed little fun things into their games.
}Usually, these things would not crop up under ordinary game play.  Sometimes
}it requires doing certain things, typing certain codes, or even activating
}the program on a particular day or time.  Sometimes these little things are
}called "easter eggs."  Below are some such things that can be found in some
}of Apogee's games, and the instructions for getting to them.
}
}[Rise of the Triad]
}
}If you start ROTT when your system clock indicates that it's one of five
}different holidays, the "group picture" of the five main characters is
}changed slightly.  In addition, on Christmas, the music for the first
}level is changed to a familiar Christmas tune.  The holidays and effects
}are as follows:
}
}   Easter             <varies>    Lorelei Ni wears Easter Bunny ears.
}   Cinco de Mayo      05/05/XX    Ian wears a sombrero.
}   Independence Day   07/04/XX    Doug holds an American flag.
}   Halloween          10/31/XX    Thi wears a witch's hat.
}   Christmas          12/25/XX    Taradino wears a Santa Claus hat; new music
}                                  for the first level.
}
}Also, there's a way to get all five "holiday hats" in Rise of the Triad to
}show up on the screen at the same time.  If you finish the game the right way,
}and destroy all the larvae in the last level, watch ALL the credits (takes
}several minutes).  You'll get to a screen that says "The HUNT is victorious.
}The End."  Do nothing.  Let it sit there for about a minute or two, and
}you'll get another "The End" screen where all five "holiday hats" are shown
}at once.
}
}In addition, several people have run across the curious message "I'm Free"
}while playing ROTT, and don't know what it means.  If you get this, you're
}probably playing either the "This Causes An Error" level in the registered
}version, or you're playing a user-made level.  The cause of the note is
}whenever a moving wall crosses the boundary of a level and just keeps on
}going.  The game detects the problem, but, before crashing with a regular
}error message, manages to put up the picture saying, "I'm Free" (drawn by
}Tom Hall).
}
}What all this is, is a manifestation of in-house humor.  If you don't get it,
}that's good, because you're not supposed to.  It's one of those "you had to
}be there" things.  At any rate, the story goes...during the development of
}ROTT, when a level was tested wherein a pushwall was inadvertantly directed
}out of the level bounds, someone joked, saying, "I'm free."  He probably
}wishes he hadn't, for all the confusion it's caused customers who have run
}across it -- either that, or, if he were more like me, he feels a deep sense
}of satisfaction in having successfully dumbfounded a significant enough
}percentage of the gaming community to warrant mention in FAQs such as these.

[Wacky Wheels]

}To see the Dopefish, a creature from Commander Keen, start any single player
race.  When everybody else moves, stand still.  Hold down the break, and turn
left all the way around until the Dopefish shows up.  Note:  the lion that
starts the race must remain on the screen the entire time; otherwise, the
Dopefish won't appear.  You can do this as many times as you like, so long
as the lion doesn't leave the screen.

[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

Raptor was written by Cygnus, and it seems to be a birthday present to
themselves.  Whenever Raptor is started when your system's clock matches the
birthday of one of the people at Cygnus, Raptor behaves a little strangely.
}Here's the list of recognized birthdays.  You can reset your system clock
}to one of these dates manually, if you wish; any year should be all right,
}so long as it's not in the past:
}
}                       March 12        Bobby Prince
}                       May 16          Scott Host
}                       August 28       Rich Fleider
}                       October 2       Jim Molinets
}
}Note that in v1.0 of Raptor, Bobby Prince's birthday was not recognized,
}while Tim Neveu's was.

What happens is this:  first, the Apogee logo is displayed, but not with
Apogee's trademark music.  Instead, you hear the Cygnus folks, sounding a
little tipsy, humming the Apogee theme music themselves.  In addition, some
of the Raptor levels contain enemies that don't normally appear such as
monkeys who throw coconuts at you, raptor dinosaurs scurrying across the
screen, and cows with machine guns concealed beneath their hides.  Most of
these peculiar enemies appear on the first mission of the game, and they
are usually difficult to kill.

Finally, when you exit the game, you get to hear the member of Cygnus whose
birthday it is give an impersonation of a monkey.  This might consist of
hooting or screeching sounds, or simply an eloquent rendering of the word
}"monkey."  (The raucous you hear when monkeys appear during the game are
}all the monkey impersonations playing together at random.)

There is a way, beyond setting the system time to a particular birthday, of
getting the monkeys and raptors and cows to fight you.  When the screen comes
up where you must choose a sector to fly, flip the switch at the bottom center
of the screen by clicking on it with the mouse.  It should darken.  This
activates the three lights to the right of this switch.  In version 1.0 of
Raptor, you should turn on the first and third lights; in v1.1 and v1.2 of
Raptor, you should turn all three lights on.  Then you can select a sector or
"auto pilot" and fly the level.  You'll know the cheat worked if you hear a
static-like sound.  All levels have some new enemy that appears by using this
cheat, though sometimes they are small and inconspicuous.  Besides monkeys,
cows, and raptors, there are:  the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship
from Space 1999, pedestrians, a woman sunbathing on a roof, and other
miscellaneous items.

}Note, however, that if you activate the "battle cow" mode using the switches,
}as opposed to running the game on a Cygnus birthday, you don't get the goofy
}Apogee theme song in the beginning, nor the individual monkey impersonation
}at the end.

}[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!]
}
}In Keen: Galaxy, episode 4, go to the level entitled "Pyramid of the Moons,"
}and from there, to the half moons painted on the floor.  If you stand on
}these and do nothing for a while, Keen will moon you, instead of his usual
}idle activity of reading a book.  This will only happen once per game,
}however.

Also, in all episodes of Commander Keen, signs are written in an alien
language.  The comment is made, "too bad you don't know the language."  Well,
now you do.  The language is a simple symbol substitution, the key of which
is given below.  This key appears only twice in all the Keen games; in the
secret areas of the secret levels of episodes three and six.
