[1.4]  What Is Apogee?

Apogee is a games distributor for PC games of many sorts.  It is a diverse
gaming company, contributing to several different genres of games.  While
much of what Apogee publishes are games written primarily by other companies,
such as Cygnus or Argo Games, Apogee writes their own games as well.  Apogee's
staff includes an array of talented programmers, artists, and musicians.  For
many years now, Apogee has been among the leading shareware games companies
for the PC and compatible market.

In June of 1994, Apogee announced a new spin-off company called 3D Realms,
which would only produce 3D action games.  At that time, the 3D games Apogee
had in development -- "Duke Nukem 3D," "Shadow Warrior," "Blood," and "Ruins:
Return of the Gods" -- became 3D Realms games instead of Apogee games.
(Since then, the rights to "Blood" were sold to Monolith Productions, and
"Ruins: Return of the Gods" was sold to Playmates Interactive Entertainment
who changed the title to "PowerSlave.")

Later, on February 4, 1997, a third company was announced: Pinball Wizards.
As its predecessor, 3D Realms, specializes in state of the art 3D action
games, Pinball Wizards will specialize in state of the art pinball games.
The pinball game Apogee previously had under production, "Balls of Steel,"
moved to the Pinball Wizards division.

It is Apogee's intention for most if not all of its future games to be
funneled through specialized divisions such as 3D Realms and Pinball Wizards.
The goals of each brand is to produce the best games in their respective
genres.

This FAQ covers not only Apogee and its games but also all of Apogee's
specialized divisions and their games.

[1.5]  What Does "Apogee" Mean?

According to the American Heritage dictionary, "apogee" means:  "the point
in the orbit of the moon or of an artificial satellite most distant from
the earth."  Or, more generally, "the farthest or highest point; apex."
Related words are the Greek "apogaion," the neuter form of "apogaios"
which means "away from the earth."  There is also the New Latin word
"apogaeum," which is derived from the Greek word.  There is a French word
"Apogee" (with an accent over the first 'e').  In English, there is the
related word "apogean" and the antonym "perigee."

Interestingly, the meaning of the word "apogee" was one of the questions in
the shareware version of an early Apogee quiz game (discontinued since)
entitled "Word Whiz."

All this is academic, however, for according to an Apogee slogan, "Apogee
means action."  :-)

[1.6]  How Apogee Markets Its Games

In 1987, Apogee came up with a unique method of marketing their games.  Since
then, other shareware companies have adopted their strategy.  Their scheme is
this:  each game they produce is divided into three to four, sometimes even
six episodes.  The first episode is free.  It can be downloaded from
the Internet or CompuServe, or bought in a store that distributes shareware
games for disk copying charges.  You can distribute the shareware episode to
your friends yourself, if you like, provided you leave all the original files
intact.

Starting in June 1994, Apogee began the creation of specialized brands for its
games.  The company 3D Realms was created for Apogee's 3D action games.  In
February 1997, the Pinball Wizards division was born for its pinball games.
In the future, few if any of Apogee's games will be released under its own
name but rather under one of its specialized brands.

If you like the shareware episode of an Apogee game, Apogee requires that you
register it.  This is the normal rule regarding shareware.  Upon registration,
you will receive the complete game.  Apogee uses this marketing scheme so that
people can have a good idea about the game they are buying before they put
their cash on the line.

Starting with Death Rally, the registered versions of most Apogee games are
published simultaneously in retail by GT Interactive.  So, if you'd rather not
order Apogee games by mail, you can pick them up at your local software store.

[1.7]  Getting the Latest Information

There are a few ways to get the latest information about Apogee, even if you
want it more quickly than keeping up with the latest revisions of this FAQ
would do.  These methods are mentioned briefly in the following sections.

On Usenet, the newsgroups alt.games.apogee, comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action,
and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc all carry discussion about Apogee's latest.
Apogee monitors these, plus the gaming, shareware, and Apogee support
conferences on Fidonet, Rime, and Intelec.

[1.7.2]  Apogee's Internet mailing list

Apogee has an Internet mailing list for press releases, announcements for
newly released games, slide shows, or important patches, and other
miscellaneous information.  The traffic is sporadic and very minimal.  The
mailing list includes information about any of Apogee's specialized divisions,
such as 3D Realms, and is free of charge.

[2.1]  Other Companies

[2.1.1]  What is Apogee's relationship with id?

Joe Siegler's explanation of the relationship between Apogee and id follows:

Apogee and id Software are two completely different companies.  They
always have been, always will be.  Apogee doesn't own id; id doesn't own
Apogee; nor is one a division of the other.

Apogee Software writes and distributes software.  Of the many games that
Apogee has published, only a handful have not been written by Apogee as
well.  id Software wrote three of these games, namely, Keen: Vorticons,
Keen: Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D.

id Software writes software, and up until Doom, had never published anything
themselves.  id has published through a few companies, Apogee being one of
them.  As mentioned before, Keen Vorticons, Keen Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D
were distributed by Apogee.  (At later dates, id went on and also published
Keen Galaxy and Wolf3D in the stores through GT Software, but that's another
story.)  Some earlier id efforts such as Catacomb 3D are distributed
through Softdisk.  (Technically, these early games, such as Catacomb 3D,
Dangerous Dave, and Rescue Rover, are Softdisk games, not id Software games,
though they were made by the same people who would ultimately found
id Software.  The first game released as an "id Software" game was
Keen: Vorticons.)

Starting with Doom, id has been publishing on their own. Apogee has absolutely
nothing to do with Doom, nor future titles by id Software.  Furthermore,
starting with the release of Heretic, id Software will also be publishing games
on their own label.  They licensed their Doom engine to two companies, Raven
Software and Cygnus Studios (whose credits include Raptor).  (The game
produced by Cygnus Studios was cancelled and picked up by a company called
Rogue.) The two games produced under this agreement (Heretic and Strife
respectively), were published under the "id" label exactly the same way that
id Software themselves published Wolfenstein 3D under the "Apogee" label.

There has been no "big divorce," or "feud" or something along those lines
between id and Apogee.  The id crew and the Apogee crew are all good friends,
and in fact get together every once in a while to shoot pool at the id
offices.  Other mutual activities include paintball (which also involves
Cygnus).  There was never a fallout between Apogee and id.  Anyone implying
this is attempting to drive a wedge where it doesn't belong or exist.

[2.1.2]  What's Apogee's relationship with Softdisk?

Daniel Tobias' (senior programmer/editor for Softdisk) explanation of the
relationship between Apogee, id, and Softdisk follows:

Apogee and Softdisk are two companies whose paths have crossed time and
again since Scott Miller submitted Kingdom of Kroz to them on November 26,
1987.  It won second place in Softdisk's CodeQuest '87 and published on
issue #20 of Softdisk's subscription software product "Big Blue Disk"
(which later became "On Disk Monthly" and, finally, "Softdisk PC").  Scott
Miller continued to submit his games, listed below:

   Title                  Submitted     Issue/Date
   -----                  ---------     ----------
   Kingdom of Kroz        11/26/87      BBD #20, 06/88
   Computer Quiz          01/20/88      BBD #21, 07/88
   Astronomy Quiz         01/20/88      BBD #26, 11/88
   Maze Runner            01/20/88      BBD #26, 12/88
   BASIC Quiz             01/20/88      BBD #28, 02/89
   Dungeons of Kroz       01/20/88      BBD #29, 03/89
   Meteors                03/12/88      BBD #30, 04/89
   Block Five             01/20/88      BBD #32, 06/89
   Caverns of Kroz        04/22/89      BBD #35, 09/89
   Castle of Kroz         08/31/89      BBD #47, 09/90

These are available as back issues of the Big Blue Disk; only the Kroz games
are currently available from Apogee.

Apogee's Vice President George Broussard wrote a game for Softdisk under
contract called "Scubadventure," which was published as part of a defunct
monthly game disk subscription from Softdisk and also sold as a stand alone
item.  Scubadventure came about when Scott Miller, intrigued by id Software's
Catacomb 3D, wanted to contract id to make a 3D shareware game for him.  id
was reluctant, instead intending to make another Commander Keen game, but
Scott Miller gave them several proposals all of which guaranteed a large sum
of money.  However, id was obligated to make another game for Softdisk, so
Apogee made an arrangement whereby Apogee would make a game for Softdisk,
thus freeing id to write a 3D game for Apogee.  id's game for Apogee was, of
course, Wolfenstein 3D, and Apogee's game for Softdisk was Scubadventure.

Apogee's Keith Schuler also made a submission to Softdisk, namely,
"Chagunitzu," the forerunner of Apogee's "Paganitzu."  This was published
by Softdisk on Big Blue Disk #44 (dated 6/90).

The id team also has its ties with Softdisk.  Originally, the people who
ultimately founded id Software worked for Softdisk and wrote numerous
games for them.

Games done as full-time employees of Softdisk:
      Catacomb         [2D game published first as an Apple II version on
                        Softdisk #114, then ported to the PC for BBD #50]
      Dangerous Dave   [published on a game "sampler disk"]
      Catacomb II      [later changed to "The Catacomb"]
      Slordax

Games done on a contract basis after the id group left:
      Rescue Rover
      Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion
      Hovertank 3D
      Keen Dreams
      Rescue Rover 2
      Catacomb 3D
      Tiles of the Dragon

Solo works of John Romero:
      Twilight Treasures    [on BBD #35]
      Zappa Roids           [on BBD #36] (also an Apple //e version)
      Pyramids of Egypt     [on BBD #46]
      Sub Stalker                        (Apple //e version)
      Double Dangerous Dave              (Apple //e version)

Solo works of John Carmack:
      Dark Designs I        [on BBD #52]
      Dark Designs II       [on BBD #54]
      Tennis

Keen Dreams was released in a shareware version by Softdisk (latest shareware
release is v1.20), as well as various registered, catalog, and retail
editions.  (Apogee does not distribute Keen Dreams -- those who would like it
should contact Softdisk.)

The 3D game, "Catacomb Abyss," was not written by the id crew, but rather a
team of Softdisk programmers, headed by Greg Malone, after they had left.
The engine for "Catacomb Abyss," however, was the Catacomb 3D engine
previously written by id.  "Catacomb Abyss" is part of a trilogy along with
"Catacomb Apocalypse" and "Catacomb Armageddon."  Greg Malone later became
the creative director for Duke Nukem 3D and, for the first half of its
production, Shadow Warrior, two of 3D Realms' games.

Of the various people mentioned elsewhere in this FAQ, the following are
former full-time Softdisk employees:  Jason Blochowiak, Adrian Carmack,
John Carmack, Tom Hall, Jerry K. Jones, Greg Malone, Michael Maynard, John
Romero, and James T. Row.

[2.1.3]  What's Apogee's relationship with Parallax?

Originally, the game Descent, written by Parallax and distributed by Interplay,
}was to be an Apogee game.  And indeed, Parallax and Apogee worked on it
}together for seven or eight months.  But due to financial issues, Apogee
}cancelled it in January of 1995.  Interplay picked it up, impressed by
}the working demo Parallax then had after its association with Apogee, and
}the rest is history.

In the credits for Descent, there is a thank you note to "Scott Miller and
Apogee Software."  Apogee's Joe Siegler asked Descent's project leader, Mike
Kulas, about this credit.  Mike's response is given below:

          Hi Joe,

          We put Scott and Apogee in there because we truly appreciate
          all that Apogee did for us.  Scott showed a lot of faith in
          us when we didn't really have anything to show anybody.  If
          not for Scott, I don't think we would be anywhere near where
          we are today.

          You can tell people exactly this, if you like.

          Mike

}Mike is also quoted in PC Gamer, Vol. 2, No. 4, as saying, "They're really a
}great bunch of guys, and they were a big help on Descent."  Matt Toschlog,
}also a key member of the Descent team, is also quoted: "Without them [Apogee],
}I don't know how we would have gotten started."

[2.2]  The Apogee Theme Song

The earliest hint of a theme song for Apogee Software might have been in such
early games as Crystal Caves and Secret Agent, wherein the then Apogee logo
was accompanied by a series of trills uttered by the PC speaker.  It was
less of a theme song and more of a "semi-standard opening" for Apogee games
at the time.  The first real appearance of the familiar Apogee theme song,
was in the game Major Stryker.  Today, any Apogee fan will instantly recognize
the Apogee theme song and will probably be capable of humming it on command.
The Apogee theme song is a short, simple, but sweet few bars, and one could
easily imagine it as a theme in a symphony or fugue.

Lee Jackson's paraphrased history of the Apogee theme song follows:

Robert "Bobby" Prince, the composer of the scores of numerous Apogee games,
did the original theme song, which appeared essentially unaltered in Major
Stryker, Monster Bash, Bio Menace, Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, and Blake
Stone: Planet Strike.  He composed a "rock"-like version for Duke Nukem II,
which was later used in Raptor v1.2.  (Previous versions of Raptor had a
version of the theme much like the original.)

For Halloween Harry (Alien Carnage) and Mystic Towers, something different
was needed.  These used MOD music instead of the MIDI-style used in our other
games, so a new file was needed.  The folks at SubZero composed a dramatic
version for Harry; an appropriately silly version was made for Mystic Towers.

I took over the MIDI version of the fanfare starting with Hocus Pocus.  It
wasn't something I was asked to do -- I just played around with an idea, gave
it to Tom Hall and Joe Siegler, who then played it for Scott Miller and
George Broussard, who dubbed it the "John Williams fanfare."  (It was actually
an attempt to emulate the MOD file that SubZero did for Harry -- I always
liked it.)  This fanfare has appeared in Hocus Pocus, Wacky Wheels, Boppin,
}Rise of the Triad, Realms of Chaos, and XenoPhage: Alien Bloodsport.
}
}For Stargunner, again something new was needed since Stargunner used MOD music
}instead of MIDI.  The "John Williams fanfare" MIDI didn't really work with the
}musical style introduced in Stargunner.  I tried several different MOD
}versions of the fanfare and never got anything that satisfied me.  So I
}talked the Stargunner team into supporting large WAV files so I could use a
}digitized recording of a MIDI playback of the fanfare.  Scott and George
}wanted a new fanfare that featured rock instead of orchestral music.  I came
}up with the new fanfare, played it out through one computer into the
}Roland SC-88 in the studio, and recorded it digitally into a second computer.
}That was the fanfare that wound up in Stargunner.
}
}One final note that should be mentioned in this section is Raptor's unique
}hidden rendition of the theme.  When Raptor is started when the system date
}is set to the birthday of one of the Raptor team members, you don't hear the
}usual theme.  Instead, it's a sound file of the Raptor team trying (in vain)
}to sing the theme song themselves.  More information on this can be found
}in the "secrets and other fun things" section.

[2.3]  The Dopefish

}(Note:  Longtime Dopefish fan Joe Siegler, of Apogee, made a Dopefish web page
}in October 1995, which contains a modified version of the following text,
}plus links to images, animation, sounds, and music of the various art and
}memorabilia mentioned herein.  The URL is http://www.dopefish.com/.)

The history of the Dopefish, as told by Lee Jackson and Joe Siegler:

Dopefish is the product of the fertile mind of Tom Hall.  It was one of twenty
four drawings he did of ideas for characters for Commander Keen: Goodbye,
Galaxy! while part of id Software.  Dopefish was one of the characters from
these drawings that made the cut.  According to Tom, "I just drew this stupid
little fish," and the rest is history.

Dopefish is described in the cast of characters for "Commander Keen: Secret
of the Oracle" (Keen 4, the shareware episode of "Commander Keen: Goodbye
Galaxy!") as the second dumbest creature in the universe (the number one
ranking is anyone's guess).  His thought patterns go, "swim swim hungry, swim
swim hungry."  Dopefish "will eat anything alive and moving near them, though
they prefer heroes."  Dopefish appears in the level of Keen 4 entitled "The
Well of Wishes."

Dopefish was "adopted" by the Tech Support staff at Apogee soon after Joe
Siegler was hired.  When Steve Quarrella and Lee Jackson joined the company,
it ballooned from there.  Dopefish was Joe's favorite character, and Steve
was the resident Keen expert.  Lee provided a few vocal effects and some
art.  They got hold of some screen capture software and went to town.

The Dopefish "product line" started with an ANSI screen which Joe and Lee did.
Joe converted a screen capture to raw ANSI, and Lee cleaned it up and made it
presentable.  After this, we convinced Jay Wilbur (formerly of id Software)
to have some Dopefish polo shirts made from an EPS file of the front-facing
burping Dopefish (a.k.a. "Burpfish").  When Christmas rolled around, Brenda
Jackson (Lee's wife) decided we needed to bring Dopefish into the real world,
so she made 20 or so stuffed Dopefish dolls (mostly side view, with a couple
of Burpfish for good measure).  These were done in both EGA (green) and CGA
(purple) versions and were given out at the Apogee Christmas party that year.
When Jay Wilbur heard of this, his first thought was that they needed to get a
life.  For Christmas 1993, Brenda took a printed enlargement of a screen
capture and did pixel-for-pixel-accurate needlepoint tree ornaments, and Joe
had coffee cups made with a Burpfish on them.  Below the Burpfish on the mugs
is the caption, "Eat Your Veggies!" which is the title of the music for the
level that Dopefish appears in, composed by Bobby Prince.  Brenda also made a
mobile of Dopefish for Christmas 1994, but due to extreme delays in getting it
done, it was never delivered until July 1995.

Please note that this Dopefish merchandise is not, and was never, for
sale to the general public.  They were all strictly in-house gags, so
please don't swamp Apogee with requests for any of these items.  However,
if you're a Dopefish fan and have created some goofy Dopefish items yourself,
Joe Siegler would love to hear about them.  See the sections on "contacting
Apogee" for information on how to reach him.

Other Dopefish-related items that have appeared include an MS-Windows icon, an
OS/2 icon, an OS/2 Warp startup logo, an OS/2 Warp web explorer animation file,
and a Win95 animated Burpfish icon.  There's also an MS-Windows BMP that Tom
Hall put together that, when tiled, looks great as a background.  More
recently, a newer version of the Windows background has a color resolution of
16.7 million colors.  It was created by a Dopefish fan and is available on the
Dopefish web page.  Also Joe Siegler has a full-page Dopefish that will
occasionally mysteriously show up in someone else's fax machine.  On
}November 2, 1995, Matt Long of the now-defunct Software Creations BBS gave Joe
a Far Side cartoon that originally involved a piranha, but was changed to
read "Dopefish."  Dopefish has also appeared in countless taglines, Internet
signature files (described by Tom Hall as "Pisces Swimeatus;" this graphic
appears at the end of this FAQ), and even in a reinterpretation of the birth
of the universe, where the Big Bang is replaced by the Big Burp.  Steve even
holds the title, granted via a mail-order ordainment service, as "Pope of the
Church of the Dopey Fish."  The title is legally recognized, by Texas state
law.
   
Dopefish mania attained a new high in October 1995 when Joe Siegler, one of
Dopefish's most avid proponents, announced the grand opening of a Dopefish
web page, called "The Well of Wishes," containing images and sound files of
the Dopefish's various and diverse incarnations, a Dopefish screen saver, plus
a slightly modified version of this very text.

To date, Dopefish has been involved in three Apogee games:  Commander Keen:
Goodbye, Galaxy! (as a character), Wacky Wheels (making a secret cameo
appearance), and Rise of the Triad (as a command line parameter).  In addition,
Joe Selinske designed an entire level around the Dopefish, namely the first
level of the rejected ROTT level set, which is titled "Use the Fish."  If
you load this level up, use the map cheat, and look at the map, you'll see
that the entire level is essentially the Dopefish -- you're playing inside.
The title "Use the Fish" comes from the fax that Jay Wilbur, then of id
Software, sent Apogee when he granted them permission to use the Dopefish as
a cameo character.  Yet another incarnation of the Dopefish in ROTT is only in
version 1.3 of the game -- when you complete it, there's a picture of a bucked
tooth Joe Siegler (teeth compliments of artist Stephen Hornback) with a
Dopefish pillow (again, made by Lee Jackson's wife Brenda) in his lap.

Dopefish did, however, almost make an appearance in 3D Realms' Duke Nukem 3D.
Early in development, there was a shark in Duke Nukem 3D that would show up
when Duke was underwater.  Originally, if you started the game with "dopefish"
as a command line parameter, the sharks would be Dopefish instead.  However,
the sharks were cut from the game and with them went the Dopefish cameo.  At
the last minute, the sharks were reinstated, but Dopefish was not.  Still, the
work done for this survives.  The artwork for Dopefish's cancelled Duke cameo,
by Chuck Jones, is available on the Dopefish web page as an animation file.
A second animation file is also there of Chuck's first 3D rendered Dopefish,
spinning in place.  Lee Jackson's music, "DopeJaws," a sinister arrangement
of Bobby Prince's "Eat Your Veggies" intended for Dopefish's cameo, is also
available.  The final release of Duke Nukem 3D did, however, contain a
Dopefish reference.  A hidden message deep in episode one, level five, boldly
states, "Dopefish Lives!"  In June 1996, a Dopefish fan designed a humorous
replacement graphic for the registered version of Duke Nukem 3D that turns
the drones into Dopefish.  That, too, is also available on the Dopefish web
page.

Dopefish appears in yet another game:  id Software's Quake.  In the shareware
episode, take the path that leads to the nightmare difficulty level selection
and shoot the square on the wall at the end of the stairwell -- you'll see
a cryptic message that says, "The Well of Wishes awaits in the Crypt of
Decay."  The Crypt of Decay is a level in the registered version of Quake
(episode two, level three).  The Dopefish appears in a hidden area of this
level.  Visual instructions for getting to it appears in the Dopefish web
page.

Music composed for the Dopefish is a tradition in itself.  Bobby Prince's
original music, called "Eat Your Veggies," was originally intended for the
Softdisk game, "Keen Dreams," (see the section on the history of Commander
Keen for further information) but Softdisk insisted that the game fit on a
360K disk, so the music had to be left out.  Instead, it was incorporated
into the following Keen game, the first episode of "Commander Keen: Goodbye,
Galaxy!"  The music appears in more than one level of the game, but is
commonly referred to by Keen and Dopefish fans as the "Dopefish level music."
A MIDI file of this was created by Bobby Prince in 1993, and in 1994 it was
turned backwards as a joke.  Also in 1994, Lee Jackson composed "Fish Polka,"
for Rise of the Triad and can be heard by using the level warp cheat.  In
1995, Lee made "DopeJaws," a sinister arrangement of Bobby's "Eat Your
Veggies," which was intended for the aborted Dopefish cameo in Duke Nukem 3D.
All of the musical compositions mentioned above can be downloaded from the
Dopefish web page.

As if Dopefish mania were not nerdly enough, in December 1996, Apogee received
a letter from a person (then) living on a US Army Base on Kwajalein in the
Marshall Islands who was going to high school there.  Their school has a
tradition where seniors spraypaint something on the sidewalk.  This student
spraypainted "Dopefish."  A picture of it was taken shortly before a school
official decided that he didn't like the word "dope" and had it painted over.

Why Dopefish?  Well, he swims, he eats, and he burps.  What more can you ask
for?  I personally think that the latter reason is why Joe likes him so much.
Joe is known for a few wall rattlers and personally did the voice of Dopefish
in Wacky Wheels and Rise of the Triad.  He really practiced for it, too.
Sitting at his computer at four in the morning with a two liter bottle of
Diet Coke, he ran through take after take, hurting himself a couple times
in the process, until he came up with just the right length and resonance.

Even though the Dopefish belongs to id Software, he is a welcome adopted
member of the Apogee family.  If there are ever any new Keen games, you can
wager a goodly amount that the Dopefish will be in it.

[2.4]  History of Specific Games

[2.4.1]  The Kroz Series

Scott Miller had been programming games since 1975, when he was in high
school.  "Caverns of Kroz" was the very first Kroz game, written in Turbo
Pascal and originally endowed with the simple title "Kroz."  It was sold to
the disk magazine I.B.Magazette, as was the second Kroz adventure, "Dungeons
of Kroz" (originally titled "Kroz II").  In 1987, Scott wrote "Kingdom of
Kroz" and, with the full knowledge that, at the time, 99% of shareware was
not profitable for its authors, released it into the shareware market.  Thus,
it was a mystifying surprise when Kroz turned out to be a smash hit.  The
letters poured in, expressing love for the game and demanding sequels.  One
of the reasons it was so successful, besides the merit of the game itself, was
its then new marketing scheme; Kroz was the first game to be split into
smaller episodes, with one episode released as shareware.

In 1988, Kingdom of Kroz I received top honors in the game category of
Softdisk's CodeQuest '87, a national programming contest, and came in second
overall (it lost to a spreadsheet program).  Scott Miller himself said, in the
notes to a later version of the game, "Thanks to Kroz, I now know what a mutual
fund is, but on the downside my taxes require a book two inches thick to
figure out."

In short, Kroz marked Apogee's birth, emergence into the national
mainstream, and coronation as one of the earliest kings of shareware.

What inspired Kroz?  At the time, Scott Miller's favorite games were
M.U.L.E., Archon, and Spelunker, among others.  He liked games where puzzle
solving was first, and the action secondary.  Kroz's main inspiration was
probably Rogue, which Scott used to play, but disliked for its randomness
and reliance on chance.  So Kroz was born.  Another of Scott's favorite
games is evident from the title; Kroz spelled backwards is "Zork," one of
Infocom's most famous and successful text adventure games.

The various episodes and versions of Kroz are many.  To confuse the issue,
Kroz, as well as many of the other early Apogee games, were not sold
strictly in a single bundle of three or four episodes.  The shareware
episode, Kingdom of Kroz, could be registered at a cost of $7.50, and this
registration made the customer eligible to buy other episodes at $7.50 each,
or several episodes at some savings.  The episodes of Kroz are as follows:

              1.  Caverns of Kroz
              2.  Dungeons of Kroz
              3.  Kingdom of Kroz
              4.  Return to Kroz
              5.  Temple of Kroz
              6.  The Final Crusade of Kroz
              7.  The Lost Adventures of Kroz

"Return To Kroz" was published in two separate disk magazines, under different
titles.  One title was "Shrine of Kroz"; the other, "Castle of Kroz."  Scott
finally decided upon the "Return to Kroz" title because he liked the title to
the third Star Wars movie.  Similarly, "Valley of Kroz" was an alternate title
given to "Temple of Kroz."

Episodes 1-3 comprised "The Kroz Trilogy," and originally published on
Softdisk's Big Blue Disk series.  These episodes were later redone in 1990,
their names changing to "Caverns of Kroz II," "Dungeons of Kroz II," and
"Kingdom of Kroz II."  Since Kingdom of Kroz II had significant map changes
to 17 different levels, the original "Kingdom of Kroz I" remained available
for purchase to registered owners of "Kingdom of Kroz II."

Episodes 4-6 comprised "The Super Kroz Trilogy."  These contained more
levels, more items, and more effects.  This trilogy was intended to complete
the Kroz series, but the letters kept pouring in, including one from
Patricia Baker, RI, who said, "I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and
was sorry tonight to finally find the Amulet."

So one final episode of Kroz was to be made, namely Episode 7, "The Lost
Adventures of Kroz."  This contained 75 new levels, and, as such, was sold
at the slightly steeper rate of $20.  As said earlier, however, the rates
were lowered if more episodes were purchased at once.  In early 1991, one
could buy the first six episodes for $35 total, or $45 for all seven.

"The Lost Adventures of Kroz" was the final episode to be completed.  At
one time, another episode had been planned for release in March 1991
entitled "The Underground Empire of Kroz," but this never saw the light of
day.  Apogee, along with the rest of the gaming community, started moving
on toward more ambitious projects.

Unlike most of Apogee's early games, the Kroz series is still commercially
available from Apogee.  The episodes you'll get upon a $24.95 registration are
the revised Kroz Trilogy, the Super Kroz Trilogy, and the Lost Adventures.
You cannot buy the individual episodes for Kroz or any other Apogee game any
longer; Apogee stopped doing this in mid 1993.

[2.4.2]  Commander Keen

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Keen series:

The seven Commander Keen games were all written by id Software.
They are:

  1) Marooned on Mars    ---\
  2) The Earth Explodes     | ---> Invasion of the Vorticons
  3) Keen Must Die       ---/
3.5) Keen Dreams
  4) Secret of the Oracle    --\__  Goodbye Galaxy
  5) The Armageddon Machine  --/
  6) Aliens Ate My Babysitter

Episodes 1-3 are collectively called "Invasion of the Vorticons,"
and are published by Apogee Software.   This series of Commander Keen
was released on December 14th, 1990, according to Tom Hall, then Creative
Director for id Software and, later, for Apogee.

Episodes 4 and 5 are collectively called "Goodbye Galaxy," and are also
published by Apogee Software.  This series of Commander Keen was
released somewhere around June of 1991.  There was also a special CGA
edition of Keens 4-5.  The CGA version is functionally identical to the
}standard EGA version of the game, but with CGA graphics.  Apogee discontinued
}the CGA version in November 1997.

}Episode 6 is a stand-alone game which uses the Keen 4-5 engine, entitled
}"Aliens Ate My Babysitter."  From its creation in 1991 until 1996, it was
}distributed by FormGen, and Apogee merely resold it, like any other retailer
}would.  In 1996, FormGen was bought by GT Interactive and did not continue to
}distribute the game.  Therefore, Apogee was left with what stock they had at
}the time.  In August 1997, that stock ran out.  As of now, the only way to get
}Keen 6 is as a part of "The id Anthology" package, but that CD, for some
}reason, only has the CGA version of the game.  There was a playable demo of
}Keen 6 that FormGen distributed at one point.  It was released to various
}online services as #6k-demo.zip and k6demo.zip; it may or may not still exist
}in some remote part of the Internet.

Keen Dreams has kind of an interesting story.  This is referred to as
the "Lost Episode" of Commander Keen.   I like to think of it as "Keen
Episode 3.5."  The reason is that Keen Dreams falls in between
Vorticons and Galaxy both in terms of technology and story line.
Before the id guys actually formed id, the majority of them worked at
Softdisk, a computer software publisher in Shreveport, LA.  The
founding members of id Software left Softdisk to do the Vorticons
series of Keen for Apogee Software.  However, they were contractually
obligated to deliver another game to Softdisk, and since development
had started on the Galaxy series, they threw together a Keen game for
Softdisk, and Keen Dreams was born.  This game is not sold by Apogee
Software, nor does Apogee have anything at all to do with it.  You'd
need to contact Softdisk for any further information regarding Keen
Dreams.

Episodes 1, 3.5, 4, and the 3 level demo for Episode 6 are
the only ones that you are legally allowed to upload and download
anywhere.  Episodes 2, 3, 5, and the full version of Episode 6 are
commercial software, and should not appear on the Internet, any BBS,
or other online service, or should otherwise be sold except for authorized
sellers of the games.

In December 1996, id Software published a package called "The id
Anthology".  This product contains every single game that id Software
ever made, as well as some others that were made by id people for other
companies like Softdisk.  Included in this package are all seven Commander
Keen games.  As a side note, for some reason, the person at id Software who
put the package together put in only the CGA version of Keen 6.  Why they
did this, we don't know.  For more information on the id Anthology, contact
id Software (Apogee has nothing to do with the id Anthology).

Here are the BBS filenames as currently available from Apogee for the
various Keen games from Apogee.

        Keen 1 -> #1KEEN.ZIP
        Keen 4 -> #4KEEN.ZIP
        Keen 4 -> #4KEENC.ZIP (Special CGA Version)

I've seen the 3 level Aliens Demo available with the filename
#6K-DEMO.ZIP and K6DEMO.ZIP.  I've seen Keen Dreams available with
the filename KDREAMS.ZIP.  However, neither of these are Apogee
products, and I cannot vouch for the files' names.

If you played Keen 5, you may have noticed a screen that said something to
the effect of, "Join us in December 1992 for the greatest Keen adventure
yet."  There was a picture of Keen smiling, with a Santa Claus hat on.
At the time, id Software was intending to do a third series of
Commander Keen, tentatively entitled "Commander Keen: The Universe is
Toast."  However, other projects came up (Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of
Destiny, and later, Doom).  There are no serious plans now to do more
Keen.  The main reason for this is that id Software owns the rights
to Commander Keen, and any new project would have to be either done
by them (extremely unlikely), or at least approved by them.   At this
time, there are no Keen games under development by either Apogee, id,
or Ion Storm (where Tom Hall & John Romero now work as of 1997), and
if and when there ever is more Keen, it will be state of the art
of whatever technology is current at the time.

On a different note, Commander Keen, and artifacts from the Keen games have
found their way into other games.  Commander Keen is listed in the default
scoreboards of a handful of Apogee games, mentioned in the instructions of
one, and has made a few more prominent appearances, which are listed under
the "Cameos" section of this FAQ.  Also, see the section on "What's B. J.
Blazkowicz's relationship with Commander Keen?" for information on that.

Finally, you can visit the Keen: Vorticons page of the Apogee WWW pages to see
the original, rejected title screen for Keen I.  The direct URL for this
is http://www.apogee1.com/catalog/keen/.

[2.4.3]  Crystal Caves and Secret Agent

Originally, Crystal Caves and Secret Agent were developed at George
Broussard's Company, Micro F/X.  The author, Frank Maddin, poked fun at the
Apogee/id game Commander Keen by including Keen's helmet in a level of
Crystal Caves, partially obscured by some junk and debris.  Half way through
the games' development (and after the helmet was put in), George Broussard
became Scott Miller's partner at Apogee and dissolved Micro F/X.  The
as yet unfinished games Crystal Caves and Secret Agent came with him to become
Apogee games.  Keen's helmet was left in as an inside joke.

[2.4.4]  Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II

There is frequently a great deal of confusion over the correct spelling of one
of Apogee's most prized characters, Duke Nukem.  The original spelling for the
name was "Duke Nukem"; however, during the code fix stage between v1.0 and
v2.0 of the original game, Apogee found a character overseas named "Duke
Nukem" that was thought to be copyrighted.  So, for v2.0 of the original Duke
game, the name was changed to "Duke Nukum."  Then, during the programming of
Duke II, it was discovered that the character they found overseas was not
copyrighted after all -- and so the original name was reinstated.  "Duke
Nukem" is also the spelling used in all successive games that featured the
character.

The spellings "Duke Nuke 'em," "Duke Nuke'um," "Duke Nuke'm," "Duke Nuk'em"
and other variations are not, and were never, correct.

[2.4.5]  Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny

It started when a 3D game id made for Softdisk grabbed Scott Miller's
attention.  He decided that he'd like id to make a 3D shareware game for
Apogee and convinced a somewhat reluctant id to agree.  However, at the time,
id was obligated to make a game for Softdisk, so Apogee made a deal in which
Apogee would make a game for Softdisk, thereby freeing id to write the 3D game
for Apogee.  Apogee's game for Softdisk was "Scubadventure," written by George
Broussard; id's game for Apogee was the now legendary Wolfenstein 3D.

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Wolfenstein series from this
point follows:

On May 5, 1992, Apogee Software released the shareware episode of Wolfenstein
3D, and has been distributing it in the shareware market since.  Apogee
is the official distributor of Wolfenstein 3D's original six episodes in the
shareware market.

Somewhere around September of 1992, FormGen Corp released Spear of Destiny.
This is a retail sequel to Wolfenstein 3D.  This game consisted of one episode
with 20 levels.  This game consists of some new wall art, a couple of new
objects, and new boss creatures.  This game is essentially the same as Wolf3D
generally, but is completely new in the level design aspect.  This game is
available in stores like CompUSA.  Apogee also resells this product, but is not
responsible for its distribution.  Apogee has to buy it from FormGen
like any other store would.  There is a two level playable demo floating around
for Spear of Destiny.  It's the same first two levels that appear in the full
version of the game.  It is not shareware; commercial demos are for the most
part non-interactive, however, this one *is* interactive, and since it bears
a close resemblance to Wolfenstein 3D, which is shareware, the SOD demo is
frequently mistaken for being shareware, which it is not.

There have been numerous editors and extra levels created by users for both
Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny.  With regard to Wolf3D, Apogee
respectfully requests that you not make or distribute any editors, extra
levels, or other add-ons that will work on the shareware episode.  If you
choose to make add-ons, please make these items for the registered version
only, and be aware that Apogee cannot support user-created items.

Sometime in mid/late 1993, id Software decided that they were going to publish
these same six original episodes in the retail market.  These are the same six
episodes that Apogee had been selling since May of 1992.  Since Apogee was at
that time not set up for retail distribution, id Software went with another
company called is GT Software.  This package is available in CompUSA and
contains the same six episodes that Apogee distributes.  Apogee has absolutely
nothing at all to do with this product.  The GT Software version of
Wolfenstein 3D is totally a GT product.  Apogee has no control over the
packaging, quality control, or price.

In May of 1994, FormGen Corporation released two new episodes for Spear of
Destiny to stores.  The collective name of the product is "Spear of Destiny
Mission Add-On Packs."  The new episodes each have their own individual
titles, these being "Mission 2: Return to Danger," and "Mission 3: Ultimate
Challenge."  These add-ons have some new level graphics and some differently
colored actors, but is essentially more levels for Spear of Destiny.  These
extra versions require that you have the first Spear of Destiny game (the
original six Apogee Wolf3D episodes are not required).  In late 1994, FormGen
marketed a "Spear of Destiny Super CD Package," which consists of id's
original Spear of Destiny, the two additional add-on missions, and hint books
for these new episodes.  Neither Apogee Software nor id software sells the
add-ons or the CD, supports it, or has anything else to do with it.  These are
strictly FormGen products.

id Software has also either written or released versions of Wolfenstein 3D for
other platforms over time.  Apogee Software has nothing to do with any
of them.  id Software holds the copyright to Wolfenstein 3D and can
license it to others for other platforms or do whatever they want with it.
These versions are listed for completeness' sake only.

The Super Nintendo version was released around Jan/Feb of 1994.  This was
published through a company called "Imagineer."  Due to Nintendo restrictions,
some elements of the game had to be removed.  These were all Nazi references,
the dogs (replaced with rats), and blood (replaced with sweat).  This is still
a good game, especially considering what it's programmed for.  There was a
version released for the Atari Jaguar around August of 1994, and this version
is probably the best graphically of any version published.  When you go up
right against walls and the like, they do not become as blocky or chunky, as
compared to previous versions of Wolfenstein 3D.  This version was published
by Atari.  id also licensed Wolf3D so that it could be published on the
Macintosh computer.  This version was released in October 1994 and is being
distributed by MacPlay, a division of Interplay.  WolfMac is a shareware
title, and there is a shareware version of it available.  When you register,
you get something like 30 levels.  Again, Apogee has nothing to do with these
versions of Wolfenstein 3D; you would need to contact the various companies,
or id Software directly for more information on them.  In the fall of 1994,
it was revealed that Vitesse was working on a version of Wolfenstein 3D for
the Apple IIgs.  This version was being done by Bill Heinemann.  This brings
the Wolfenstein saga full circle as the original Castle Wolfenstein was
}written for the Apple //e.  However, as of November 1997, the game still
}hasn't been released and may never be.

Sometime in August/September 1995, id Software release the source code for
Wolfenstein 3D to the Internet and CompuServe.  It does not contain the code
for the levels and graphics, however, so you'll need the data files from the
shareware or commercial versions of the game for it to work properly.

The premiere issue of Game Developer's Magazine stated that Apogee Software was
working on a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II," which was to be a totally
new game, with completely new actors, and new everything; the only thing the
same being the title Wolfenstein 3D.   This information is partially
incorrect; there is no such title under production at either Apogee or id
Software.  However, this was under production at Apogee for a while back in
early 1994, but this was dropped, and the project changed to "Rise of the
Triad."  This game is now available from Apogee Software.

[2.4.5.1]  "Call Apogee and say Aardwolf"

Joe Siegler's explanation of "Aardwolf":

"Call Apogee and say Aardwolf."  It's a sign that to this day is something
that I get asked about a lot.  This is a sign that appears on a wall in a
particularly nasty maze in Episode 2 Level 8 of Wolfenstein 3D.  The sign
was to be the goal in a contest Apogee was going to have, but almost
immediately after the game's release, a large amount of cheat and mapping
programs were released.  With these programs running around, we felt that
it would have been unfair to have the contest and award a prize.  The sign
was still left in the game, but in hindsight, probably should have been
}taken out.  To this day, Apogee gets letters and phone calls and asking
}what Aardwolf is, frequently with the question, "Has anyone seen this yet?"

Also, in a somewhat related issue, letters were shown after the highest score
in the score table in some revisions of the game.  These letters were to be
part of another contest that got scrapped before it got started, where we were
going to have people call in with their scores and tell us the code; we'd then
be able to verify their score.  However, with the cheat programs out there,
this got scrapped too.

Basically, "Aardwolf" and the letters mean nothing now.  Also note that if
you found the Aardwolf sign in the game (without cheating), there's a VERY
strong chance that you're stuck in there.  The only way out may be to restart,
or load a saved game from before you went into that maze.

[2.4.5.2]  What's B. J. Blazkowicz's relationship with Commander Keen?

Besides the fact that id Software created both the Commander Keen and
Wolfenstein games, there is a further relationship between the two main
characters.  The following is an excerpt from the Official Hint Manual for
Wolfenstein 3D which explains the relation:

      William Joseph Blazkowicz was born August 15, 1911, to Polish
      immigrants.  Blazkowicz was a top spy for the Allied Forces,
      receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor and other accolades
      for heroism.  "B.J.," (as he was called by his friends) married
      after World War II, at age 40, to Julia Marie Peterson.  Their
      son, Arthur Kenneth Blazkowicz, became a television talk show
      personality in Milwaukee.  For show biz purposes, Arthur changed
      his last name to Blaze.  Arthur later married Susan Elizabeth
      McMichaels.  They had one son (which they named after Arthur's
      father), William Joseph Blazkowicz II, or as he signs his grade
      school homework, B. Blaze....

[2.4.6]  Halloween Harry and Alien Carnage

Halloween Harry was written by SubZero Software, located in Australia.
Apogee is the game's distributor.  In October of 1993, Apogee released
v1.1 of Halloween Harry in the United States.

As with Wacky Wheels and Mystic Towers, version 1.0 of Halloween Harry was
actually an incomplete version of the game released to a magazine in the UK.
The first complete, public release of Halloween Harry was version 1.1.

A month later, v1.2 of the game was released.  A year after that, Apogee
suggested a title change to "Alien Carnage."  SubZero agreed.  Thus, in
early November of 1994, "Halloween Harry" was dropped from Apogee's
distribution, and "Alien Carnage" added.  Alien Carnage v1.0 is essentially
Halloween Harry v1.2 with a name change, price change, and episode
reorganization.  The shareware version of Alien Carnage (its first episode)
is Halloween Harry's episode three.  With the exception of this
reorganization, Alien Carnage consists of the same episodes as Halloween
Harry.  The shareware version of Halloween Harry is still legal to
distribute; however, Apogee prefers you distribute the shareware version of
Alien Carnage only, as this version has the new pricing information
screens.

In late 1996, Gee Whiz! Entertainment published a sequel called "Zombie Wars."
A demo version of this was released to the Internet.  Apogee has nothing to
do with this sequel, however, and you cannot purchase the full version from
them.

[2.4.7]  Mystic Towers

Baron Baldric, the star of Mystic Towers, originally starred in a game
called, simply, "Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure."  The game was designed
for the Amiga by professional animator Lindsay Whipp of Animation F/X.  It
was then ported to the PC.  The game was a 2D scrolling platform game and
released as shareware by Manaccom in 1993.

Afterward, Lindsay Whipp began work on a second game starring Baron Baldric,
which would later become "Mystic Towers."  The character of Baldric survived
the transition between the games almost unchanged, humorous mannerisms
intact, but the game of Mystic Towers is radically different -- it's more of
a puzzle game than an action game and has the Baron moving in three
dimensions.

Apogee agreed to publish Mystic Towers for Animation F/X, and it was released
on August 15, 1994.

As with Halloween Harry and Wacky Wheels, version 1.0 of Mystic Towers was
actually an incomplete version of the game released to a magazine in the UK.
The first complete, public release of Mystic Towers was version 1.1.

[2.4.8]  Wacky Wheels

At the time of its release, in October of 1994, the registered version of
Wacky Wheels was available in two forms:  a regular version, containing three
sets of tracks, for $24.95; and an "upgrade edition," containing an additional
three sets of tracks, for $34.95.  The upgrade could be also purchased
separately for $20.  Presently, Apogee only registers the larger, six track
set, $34.95 version of Wacky Wheels, and only on CD.

As with Halloween Harry and Mystic Towers, version 1.0 of Wacky Wheels was
actually an incomplete version of the game released to a magazine in the UK.
The first complete, public release of Wacky Wheels was version 1.1.

[2.4.9]  Boppin

At the time of its release, in November of 1994, the registered version of
Boppin was available in two forms:  Basic Boppin, which contained only the
first two episodes of the game including the shareware version, for $19.95;
and Super Boppin, which contained all four episodes and a level editor, for
$29.95.  Owners of Basic Boppin could upgrade to Super Boppin at additional
cost.  Since then, Apogee has discontinued Basic Boppin and only registers
Super Boppin.

The initial version of Boppin contained a disturbing, gory logo, as well as
bloody suicide sequences when you failed to solve one of the puzzles correctly.
These were put in the game by the company that made it, Accursed Toys.
However, Apogee, Boppin's distributor, found the gore to be gratuitous and out
of place and attached a message to the game disclaiming the violent aspects of
the game.  The suicide sequences could be turned off once inside the game, but
the logo could not.  Accursed Toys received enough email protesting the gore
so that, in v1.1 of Boppin, the default was to not show any of it.  A command
line parameter, "blood," now has to be given to turn it back on.

[2.4.10] Rise of the Triad

Back in early 1994, a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II" was under
production.  This was dropped, and the project became "Rise of the Triad," or,
as it is casually known, "ROTT."  Version 1.0 was released on December 21,
1994; in February 1995, versions 1.1 and 1.2 were released.  Version 1.2 was
supposed to have fixed the problem that 1.1 introduced where 4 meg machines
could not play at all.  As it turned out, 1.2 did not fix that, and a 1.2a
patch was released a week later.  At this point, the CD version of ROTT was
burned (but not the Site License version).  After that started shipping, a
bug was found where people playing directly from the CD could not save games.
So 1.2b was released to fix this.  Since this was a CD only bug, a version 1.2b
was not released for the shareware version or disk based registered version.
The Site License version was produced after v1.2b, so that does not exist as
a version prior to 1.2b.  Version 1.3 was released for all shareware and
registered versions in August 1995.  The disk based registered version was
available starting in late February; the regular CD based registered version
started shipping in March, and the Site License CD started shipping in April.
Starting January 1997, the registered version of Rise of the Triad was
available on CD only.  In July 1995, Apogee released a package of rejected
ROTT levels, available for free in the file ROTT_REJ.ZIP.

Late that year, Apogee released an add-on pack to "Rise of the Triad" called
"Extreme Rise of the Triad," which contained an additional 42 levels and some
}new hazards, and sold on CD for $19.95.  This add-on pack was discontinued
}in November 1997.

In early 1996, Tom Hall and Joe Siegler put together what was the final
release of ROTT materials from Apogee Software.  A college in Ohio was running
a gaming contest and was using Rise of the Triad for it.  Apogee created a
special level pack with four levels for use in this contest.  Two of the
levels were done by Joe Siegler, and two by Tom Hall.  In February 1996, after
the contest was held, the file was released to the public for free
as OHIORTC.ZIP.

Tom Hall, the creative director for Rise of the Triad, dubbed the Rise of the
Triad team the "Developers of Incredible Power" (DIP).  ROTT was the first
release of the Developers of Incredible Power, under that name.  For most of
the members of "DIP," Rise of the Triad was their first real project.  Tom
Hall and Stephen A Hornback were the only ones who had worked extensively
on previous Apogee games.

The principle composer for ROTT was Lee Jackson.  In 1984, Lee Jackson marched
in a Drum and Bugle Corps, called the Nighthawks, out of Houston -- he did pit
percussion and wrote the pit parts for some of the pieces.  In his words,
"this style has a tremendous influence on my writing.  . . .  One chart from
ROTT (Havana Smooth) is almost a pure Corps chart.  . . .  Joe [Siegler] hates
Drum Corps.  [He] absolutely *can* *not* *stand* Drum Corps when he knows what
he's listening to.  I kind of slipped this song past him."  To this day, Joe
vehemently denies that this song is a Drum Corps piece.

The name of the shareware version is "Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins."
The name of the registered version is "Rise of the Triad: Dark War," which
contains four new episodes.  The four registered episodes have the titles,
in order, "Approach," "Monastery," "Caves Below," and "The Slow and the Dead."

[2.4.10.1] ROTT characters

One of the curiosities of ROTT is that the actors in the game were digitized
and voiced by members of Apogee.  The following chart shows who was scanned
and who was sampled to create each ROTT character.

[2.4.10.2] ROTT levels

There are a wealth of levels available for "Rise of the Triad," even if you
just count the "official" levels made by Apogee.  Some are packaged in various
versions of the game, some were released separately; some are free, some cost
money; some are regular (one player) levels, some are Comm-Bat (multiplayer)
levels.  Below is a description of each of the level sets available from
Apogee.

  - "Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins" is the name of the standard shareware
    episode of ROTT.  The shareware episode cannot make use of any other
    levels besides its own.
  - "Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins Deluxe Edition" is a special version
    of the shareware episode distributed ONLY by LaserSoft.  This version has
    six levels unavailable anywhere else:  three regular levels and three
    Comm-Bat levels.
  - "Rise of the Triad: Dark War" is the name of the registered version of
    ROTT.  There are several versions:  a floppy disk version, an upgraded
    floppy disk version, a CD version, and a Site License CD version.  (Both
    floppy disk versions were since discontinued.)  The upgraded floppy disk
    was the same as the regular CD version, but with fewer "extras."  The
    Site License CD version had an extra 14 Comm-Bat levels.
  - The ROTT "rejected level set" was released to the net for free.  It
    contains levels designed for "Rise of the Triad: Dark War" but eventually
    cut from the game.  A text file that accompanies this level set explains
    some of the history behind the levels.
  - "Extreme Rise of the Triad," or EROTT, is an add-on pack designed by Joe
    Siegler and Tom Hall.  It contains an additional 42 regular levels usable
    by the registered version of ROTT and utilize new tricks and traps.
}   However, EROTT was discontinued by Apogee in November 1997 and is no
}   longer available.
  - The "Ohio Comm-Bat Pack" is a set of four Comm-Bat levels designed
    especially for a contest at a college in Ohio.  After the contest, the
    levels were released to the net for free.

Here is a listing of all the levels for Rise of the Triad and who designed
each.  The vast bulk of levels were done by Tom Hall, so if no name is given
for a particular level, he made it.

[2.4.11] Terminal Velocity

Written by Mark Randel of Terminal Reality, Inc, the lead programmer of
Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0, Terminal Velocity was the first game ever
to be released under the 3D Realms label.  The slide show was released on
April 4, 1995, and the game itself followed on May 1.  And thus, 3D Realms
emerged into the "realm" of the computer gaming world.

There's a second distinguishing fact about Terminal Velocity; namely, that
it made the cover of the April 1995 issue of the gaming magazine, "Computer
Player."  This is the first time in the history of computer gaming that a
shareware game made the cover of a popular gaming magazine before its
release.  In the article, many praising comments are made:  "The 3D
environments are simply breathtaking.  Utilizing cutting-edge real-time
techniques, the graphics engine creates worlds that are like nothing seen
before in computer games."  And, "A great deal of attention was spent to
balance the fast action with the spectacular environment.  Terminal Velocity
has achieved what many have unsuccessfully tried in the past:  an incredible
combination of scenery and game play."

There are two noteworthy remarks contained in 3D Realms' initial press
release for the game.  One is, "Climb into Terminal Velocity now, and you'll
never go back to flight simulators that offer combat as an 'option.'"
Wrapping up 3D Realms' plot synopsis is the comment, "You're outgunned,
outmanned, and strapped into a flying coffin.  But just think how good
'Saved the Known Galaxy' will look on your resume."

The registered version of Terminal Velocity was sold both on disks and on CD.
}The disk based version was discontinued in March 1997.  A patch for the game
}was released in January 1997 which optimizes the game for computers with
}S3 Virge cards.  This patch was made and released by Terminal Reality,
}however, not by Apogee.

Terminal Reality later made two sequels to Terminal Velocity, both for
Windows, both distributed by Microsoft:  Fury3 in 1995, and Hellbender
}in 1996.  In late 1995, there was also a Fury3 add-on pack called F-Zone.

[2.4.12] Paganitzu and Realms of Chaos

About a year before Keith Schuler wrote Paganitzu for Apogee, he wrote
another game called Chagunitzu for Softdisk.  These two games were almost
identical, containing the same characters and story and so forth.  Unlike
Paganitzu, however, Chagunitzu does not adapt to the speed of your computer,
making it virtually unplayable on fast computers without a program to slow
the computer down.  (See the section on slowing down your computer in
this FAQ.)

Following his success with Apogee's Paganitzu, Schuler began a sequel
in early 1992 entitled, "Paganitzu II: The Bloodfire Pendant."  Later, it
went through a name change to "Alabama Smith and the Bloodfire Pendant."
Still later, its name became "Realms of Chaos," losing all its Paganitzu
references in the process.

Realms of Chaos was originally supposed to be a 16 color EGA game, slated
for a 1994 release, but, with the increasing popularity of VGA games, it was
decided that time should be spent converting Realms of Chaos to a 256 color
VGA game.  Finally, after three years in production, Realms of Chaos was
released by Apogee in November 1995.

Contrary to what one might think, the cancelled 3D Realms project
"Ruins: Return of the Gods" was not ever associated with Paganitzu, even in
its early days.

[3.1]  Games

Please note that this information is constantly changing, especially when new
games are added to the list of Apogee products.  Some of the information given
here could become out of date rather quickly.

[3.1.1]  What games are currently available from Apogee?

A list of Apogee games follows. The filename given is the file -- on
CompuServe, BBS's, and the Internet -- which contains the first episode of
each game.  Note that on the Internet, the filenames do not contain the
leading '#' mark.

The price given is the cost of the complete game with all episodes. The "Ep"
field contains the number of episodes in the complete version. The "Ver"
field contains the latest version number of the game.  "Med" are the media
that the registered version is available on ("D"=Disk, "C"=CD).  "Gph" is the
best graphics mode that the game utilizes ("T"=TEXT, "C"=CGA, "E"=EGA,
"V"=VGA, "S"=SVGA).  The "Size" fields are approximate.

 + - Spear of Destiny is a commercial piece of software by FormGen Corporation,
     now owned by GT Interactive.  id Software wrote it, and FormGen
     distributes it.  Apogee only resells this title.  There is a demo
     available from FormGen for this game, but since it is not an Apogee
     title, Apogee does not distribute the demo.
}  - Commander Keen: Aliens Ate My Babysitter was also a commercial piece of
}    software by FormGen but has been discontinued.  Therefore, Apogee cannot
}    resell this game any longer.
   - Blake Stone: Planet Strike is also distributed by FormGen but written
}    by Apogee.  However, since this is Apogee's own game, it is still
}    available for purchase.  There is no demo or shareware version of this
}    game.

 * - There is an optional CGA mode in Paganitzu.
   - There are CGA versions of Keen: Galaxy and Keen: Aliens.
   - There is a "Monster Bash Lite" version of this game, which contains the
     first three levels of the shareware episode.  Apogee does not distribute
     this version anymore, but it is still legal to pass around.  If it still
     exists on an FTP site or BBS, its filename will probably be "#1mblite.zip"
     ("1mblite.zip" on the Internet.)
   - There are several versions of Rise of the Triad available.  The regular
}    registered, no longer sold by Apogee, was $29.95 and contained 32 regular
}    levels and 30 comm-bat zones.  The power pack add-on, which is still sold
}    for the people who bought the regular registered back when it was
     available contains 10 extra comm-bat zones, a random level generator, and
}    BMP and WAV files from the game.  Super Triad, still sold, costs $34.95
     and contains everything in the regular registered, plus the power pack,
     plus more BMP and WAV files, plus some extra Apogee shareware games.
     The Site License version costs $89.95, includes 10 more comm-bat zones, a
     signed site license agreement, and eleven command cards.  For people to
     play a networked game using the registered version, each member must have
     either their own registered versions, or a site license version owned
     among them.
   - The shareware Terminal Velocity version 1.0 does not contain SVGA support.
}  - The regular registered version of Duke Nukem 3D v1.3d, no longer sold by
}    3D Realms but still available in retail, was $39.95 and also contained
}    the complete registered versions of Duke Nukem I & II.  The Atomic
}    Edition, which costs $49.95, and the Plutonium PAK upgrade, which costs
}    $19.95 and upgrades the regular registered version to the Atomic Edition,
}    does not contain Duke Nukem I or II.
 
 ' - The registered versions of these games are no longer sold.  See the
     section on games no longer sold for further information.
 
 " - There is an add-on to "Duke Nukem 3D" called the "Plutonium PAK" which
     upgrades the game to "Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition."  The Atomic Edition
     is either version 1.4 or 1.5 of Duke Nukem 3D.  Included in the Plutonium
     PAK upgrade is a new episode, a new weapon, three new monsters, and new
     cinematics.  It is available for $19.95 and requires a previously
     installed registered version 1.3d of Duke Nukem 3D.  Or, you can buy
     Duke Nukem 3D and the Plutonium PAK at the same time for $49.95.
}  - In addition, GT Interactive (not Apogee/3D Realms) distributes "The
}    Kill-A-Ton Collection," which has everything Duke in it.  It has the
}    full versions of Duke Nukem I, II, 3D, and 3D: Atomic, plus miscellaneous
}    add-ons.

 ^ - The full titles of the Keen games are "Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!,"

     Ate My Babysitter."
   - Alien Carnage used to be known as "Halloween Harry."
   - The shareware episode of Rise of the Triad is also known as "Rise of the
     Triad: The HUNT Begins;" the registered episodes are also known as "Rise
     of the Triad: Dark War."

 ` - These games contain some measure of graphic violence and may be
     unsuitable for young game players.
   - Boppin v1.0 has an option to minimize the violence somewhat.  Boppin v1.1
     does not have violent content unless a command line parameter is given.
     (See the cheats section.)

     have a version of TV different from one of these.
   - An executable for the registered version of Terminal Velocity optimized
     for the S3 Virge chipset video cards is available as TVREG_S3.ZIP.  It

 * - There is no v1.1a of the shareware version of Stargunner, and no v1.1 of
     the registered version.
   - Since a bug in the Death Rally 1.1 CD prevented its installation on
     systems with more than 64 megs of RAM, the DR64MB.ZIP file can be used
     instead to install the program.
   - Super Boppin is the full registered version of the game.  Basic Boppin
     is a cheaper, partial version of the game that is no longer sold; however,
     for the people who bought it when the game came out, this patch is still
     available.
}  - Some version of Shadow Warrior v1.2 registered have the parental lock
}    forced on.  The sw12pl patch will fix that bug, but do NOT install it
}    if you AREN'T experiencing this problem.
}  - The UK version of Shadow Warrior v1.2 registered has darts instead of
}    shurikens.  Use the sw12uk patch to fix this, but do NOT install it
}    if you AREN'T experiencing this problem.
   - Since a bug in the version 1.4 Plutonium PAK of "Duke Nukem 3D" prevented
     its installation on systems with more than 64 megs of RAM, this patch can
     also be used to upgrade "Duke Nukem 3D" from version 1.3d to version 1.5,
     but ONLY if you already own the version 1.4 Plutonium PAK CD and have it
     in the drive when the patch is running.
   - TVREG_S3.ZIP is an executable for the registered version of Terminal
     Velocity that is optimized for S3 Virge chipset video cards.  It requires
     the registered version 1.2 of the game and a S3 Virge video card.  It is
     distributed by Terminal Reality, Inc., and not by 3D Realms.

     its U.S. distributor, marketing the game under the title "Violent
     Vengeance."  This did not pan out.  The game was later released in the
     U.S. by Panda Entertainment under the original "Sango Fighter" title.

[3.2.2.1]  Alternate titles for Wolfenstein 3D

The following were all alternate titles for Wolfenstein 3D that Tom Hall
came up with.  Many, however, are joke titles and were never seriously
considered -- hence why these names are separate from those in the section
above.  The information comes from the Official Hint Manual for
Wolfenstein 3D.

Castle Ochtenstein, Luger's Run, The Fourth Reich, Adolph's Bane, Hard Cell,
Luger Me Now, Tank You Very Much, Castle Hasselhoff, How Do You Duseldorf?,
Castle Verlassen (to abandon the castle), Sturmwind (stormwind), Hollehammer
(hellhammer; this name made it in to the game as the name of the castle in
episode two), Shattensendener (shadowsender), Geruchschlect (bad smell),
Dolchteufel (devildagger), Grabgrabbener (gravedigger), Eisenschwert
(ironsword), Dammerung (twilight/dawn).

Since the above information first appeared in this FAQ, Bernd Wolffgramm,
from Germany, sent me further information about Wolfenstein 3D's names,
including spelling corrections.  (Some of the spelling mistakes resulted from
missing umlauts; an alternate spelling for German words containing vowels with
umlauts is to follow the vowel with an 'e' instead of using the accent.)

       - "Duseldorf" should be "Duesseldorf," a town on the Rhine river
         famous for its beer (Altbier).
       - "Hollehammer" should be "Hoellenhammer."
       - "Shattensendener" should be "Schattenspender."
       - "Geruchschlect" should be "Geruchschlecht."
       - "Grabgrabbener," is redundant; the word "grab," meaning "grave," is
         used twice.  A more appropriate word would be "Totengraeber."
       - "Dammerung" should be "Daemmerung."

Bernd Wolffgramm also provides further information.  Since the game is
banned in Germany because it involves Nazis and killing Germans, those who
want to play the game have come up with special codewords for it.  The most
common is "Hundefelsen 4C."  If you translate "Wolfenstein" into the German
words that comprise it, you get "Wolfstorm."  "Wolf" is the same word in
German, and "stein" means "stone" or "rock."  "Hundefelsen" is a combination
of the German words for "dog" and "wolf," and "felsen" is a synonym for
"stein."  Hence the alias, "Hundefelsen."

[3.2.3]  Cancelled projects

Frequently, projects that get started never get finished.  This can happen for
a number of reasons.  Legal problems is one common cause; slow progress and
little promise is another.  What follows is a list of projects that, for one
reason or another, never saw the light of day.  Dates are approximations of
the time each game spent under development at Apogee.

}Please do not contact Apogee for information about these games.  Little or no
}information remains about what was done, and in some cases, Apogee doesn't
}even have copies of them anymore in their archives.

[3.2.4]  Early games by the staff

Before joining Scott and Apogee in 1990, George Broussard had several projects
of his own.  The most notable were marketed under the name Micro F/X; some of
these later became the property of Apogee (such as "Pharaoh's Tomb" and
"Arctic Adventure").  Broussard also made a game for the Amiga, "The Rings
of ZON," which was like a more intellectual Boulderdash.

Other games written by George Broussard and others were written for Softdisk;
details for these projects are given in the section on Apogee's relationship
with Softdisk.

[3.3]  Previews

[3.3.1]  What slide shows are currently available?

Apogee no longer releases formal slide shows of their games.  Screen shots
are now regularly featured on the Apogee web site.  These old slide shows,
however, still exist and may be found on various web and FTP sites.

 * - The extra included shots from "Shadow Warrior" and "Ruins: Return of the
     Gods" are old and not representative of the finished productions.
     "Ruins: Return of the Gods" was a project 3D Realms used to have under
     production but which was later cancelled.

     was the name of the software company that George Broussard ran before
     he teamed up with Scott Miller in 1990.

 + - Major Stryker versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, Wolfenstein 3D version 1.3, and
     Stargunner versions 1.0 and 1.0a were never released to the public.
   - Duke Nukem 3D versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.3a, 1.3b, and 1.3c never existed.
}    Jumping to the 1.3d version number was just a joke on the part of the
}    developers.
   - There is no v1.1a of the shareware version of Stargunner, and no v1.1 of
     the registered version.

 ~ - The registered version of the game started shipping with this shareware
     version.  (If not noted, assume v1.0.)

[4.1.2]  Slide shows

From early 1993 to late 1995, Apogee and 3D Realms released slide shows of
their upcoming games which featured roughly a dozen screen shots from the
game in question.  Since then, these sneak preview images have moved to
Apogee's web site, obsoleting the need for an official slide show archive.

[4.2.3]  Cameos

Frequently, the star of one Apogee game will make a cameo appearance in
another.  Or, sometimes, someone from the real world shows up.  A list of
such cameos follows.  Appearances of Apogee characters in the default
scoreboards of games are not mentioned here, however, since there would be
too many to list.

      WARNING: much of the fun of these games is running across these
      things during play.  Do not read this section if you want to be
      surprised!

[4.3.8]  Advertising layouts

Robert Atkins and Michael Hadwin are responsible for all Apogee advertising
layouts in magazines, manuals, flyers, and so forth.  Originally, Steve Maines
held the position, but, when he left, he was replaced by Robert Atkins.
Michael Hadwin came aboard in the summer of 1995.    Atkins and Hadwin left
the company in mid 1996; afterward, all layouts and manual designs (with the
occasional exception, such as Joe Siegler's design of the Stargunner manual)
were done by GT Interactive.

[5.1]  The Shareware Episodes

[5.1.1]  The Internet

You can download the shareware versions of Apogee games from their web page,
http://www.apogee1.com/.

Or, you can download them via anonymous FTP at the following sites:

  Site Name            Directory                         Notes
  ---------            ---------                         -----
  ftp.wustl.edu        /systems/msdos/games/apogee       official site
  ftp.wustl.edu        /systems/msdos/games/3dr          official site
} ftp.3dgamers.com     /pub/games/wolf3d                 Wolf3D/Spear stuff

[5.1.2]  CompuServe

For Apogee, type "GO APOGEE" at a ! prompt.
For 3D Realms, type "GO REALMS" at a ! prompt.

(Note:  Both keywords actually go to the same, combined forum.)

[5.1.3]  Fidonet

If you are a Fidonet SysOp, you can get Apogee's games on the Fido Filebone.
Talk to your local filebone hub about the Apogee FDN areas.  See FILEBONE.NA
for more information.  Send netmail to 1:124/9006 for more information on
these areas.

[5.2]  The Registered Episodes

The registered versions of the software are the complete versions, and, as
they are not shareware, cannot legally exist on public BBS's or FTP sites.
The registered versions of the software must be purchased directly from Apogee
or from one of Apogee's dealers.  The best way to get the most recent ordering
information is by checking the company's web site.  The direct URL to
ordering information is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/order.html.  The direct
URL to pricing information is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/prices.html.

[5.2.1]  Ordering information

}To order directly from Apogee, call 1-800-APOGEE1.
}
}When calling, please have your Visa/Master Card/Discover/Amex card ready.  You
}can order both Apogee & 3D Realms game titles from this number.
}
}The lines are open 24 hours a day.  They'll need to know your CPU (XT, 286,
}386, 486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II), the best graphics mode you are
}able to run (CGA, EGA, VGA, SVGA), and whether you want the game on CD or
}disk.  Note that most games have minimum CPU and graphics requirements (the
}hardware requirements section of this FAQ lists those constrains).  Also,
}certain games are only available in certain formats -- some games are only
}available on CD, while others are only available on 3 1/2" HD disks.  The
}pricing information screen at the Apogee/3D Realms web site lists which games
}are available in which formats.
}
}If you do not have a credit card, you must mail or fax your order using the
}ORDER.FRM file that is enclosed with all the shareware copies of Apogee's
}and 3D Realms' games.  This form can be faxed or mailed.  If sending by
}mail, please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.  Fax is faster, but the 800 number
}is the fastest.
}
}To mail your order, send to:

    Apogee Software, Ltd.
    P.O. Box 496389,
    Garland TX 75049-6389
    United States of America

To fax your order, send it to (972) 278-4670.  Please include a return fax
}number if you make use of this facility.  Note that while the line is open
}24 hours a day, the people who reply aren't always there; so if you're faxing
}when it's the middle of night in Texas, you probably won't get an immediate
}reply.
}
}Shipping and handling charges are $5 within the United States, $6 to Canada
}or Mexico, and $8 for everywhere else.  (For each additional item, add $1
}within the United States or $2 elsewhere.)
}
}For more information, please visit Apogee's ordering information pages on the
}web at:
}
}       http://www.apogee1.com/misc/order.html  (for ordering information)
}       http://www.apogee1.com/misc/prices.html (for availability and pricing)

[5.2.2]  What combination deals does Apogee offer?

For some years, Apogee offered several combination deals -- two or three games
for a discounted price.  However, in early 1997, these deals were all
}discontinued save for one.  (Occasionally Apogee offers limited-time combo
}offers, but these are not listed here.)

[5.3]  Other Products

}There is usually a variety of merchandise -- such as hint booklets, T-shirts,
}mouse pads, etc -- related to Apogee's games that you can buy.  Apogee stopped
}selling these items directly in 1997, but they license other companies to
}sell them.  The Apogee web site has a page listing these licensed products;
}the direct URL is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/licensed.html.  Regarding

[6.1]  Network Services

[6.1.1]  TEN

TEN (Total Entertainment Network) is a prominent online gaming service, which
provides multiplayer games via the Internet.  Some of Apogee's newer games
support TEN.  See the list of hardware requirements and support for specific
games which support TEN.

You can visit TEN's web pages by connecting to http://www.ten.net/ for more
information.

[6.1.2]  Dwango

Terminal Velocity 1.2 and the registered version of 1.1 were shipped with
Dwango client software; for other versions of TV, you can obtain the Dwango
client software by downloading the TVDWANGO.ZIP file from any official Apogee
area, or simply upgrading to version 1.2.  All versions of Terminal Velocity
will work with Dwango if it has the client software installed.

[6.2]  Cheating

Apogee has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games, both
documented and undocumented.  Sometimes these cheats are available in all
versions of the game; other times they are only available in the registered
version.  From 1987 to around May 1993, Apogee games came with a hint sheet,
which often contained cheats in them.  From May 1993 to December 1993, Apogee
games were shipped with a XXXXHINT.EXE file, which had the same text as the
old hint sheets.  Beginning in 1994, the XXXXHINT.EXE files are done away
with too; the information is now contained in the actual game manuals.
Sometimes, however, cheats are mentioned in XXXXHELP.EXE files which
previously contained strictly technical support information.

The cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.
The customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or
game manual that comes with the game.  Some of the games also have a debugging
mode, which is not generally documented.  Their original purpose is to aid in
the beta testing of the game.  Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is
left intact, available for the regular game-player to use.  Finally, there are
technical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to
correct some technical problems.

[6.2.1]  Complete cheat list

This section contains a variety of cheats from various Apogee games.
Actually, in the words of Joe Siegler, it's "the first comprehensive
cheat [list] ever published for all Apogee titles."

Note that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by Apogee,
the debug keys are not.  If you use the debug keys, Apogee cannot provide
any support, since this alters game performance to a state where their
standard support comments and issues might not apply.  In short, neither
Apogee or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug
keys.  (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing
happening, save where expressly noted below.)

}               a debug mode is available.  Start a new game, then hit F8

                  Wacky Wheels in the shareware version, namely, the track
                  featured in the ordering information.  Follow these steps:
                       - start a new game and complete track 1
                       - save the game and quit to the main menu
                       - look at the ordering information
                       - go back to main menu and restore the saved game


[Mystic Towers]

+ Cheat Codes - Cheats are activated by typing "BALDRIC" during a level.
                Once actived, your score is reset to zero, and you can
                press the following key combos to achieve what is listed:

 [lshift] Rxx - where xx is a number of a room to jump to (01-45)  *
   [lshift] H - to get maximum health, also food and drink
   [lshift] K - to get all keys except the end tower key           *

        * These cheats work in the registered version of the game only.


[Hocus Pocus]

+ Cheat Codes - For each of the following codes, type each letter by letter:

     feelgood - get full health
        blake - get both keys
       banana - get laser shots (registered version only)
        quark - get rapid fire (registered version only)


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

+ Cheat Codes - The backspace key will restore all your energy and give
                you a death ray, at the cost of all your money.  This
                will only work in the registered version.

+ Debug Mode - Set the environment variable "S_HOST" to the value "CASTLE"
               at the DOS prompt by typing "SET S_HOST=CASTLE" (it must be
               in caps).  Then, when you play Raptor, you become completely
               invincible, and have all the weapons at your disposal.  In
               addition, you can skip levels by starting them, hitting
               [esc], followed by [n]; you'll be returned to the hangar, and
               when you exit again, you'll be on the next level.

               While in debug mode, you can make use of a level warp.  From
               the level selection screen (Bravo Sector, etc), type a two
               character combination, one key at a time, that specifies which
               level you wish to jump to.  The first character may be either
               'Z' (for episode one), 'X' (for episode two), or 'Y' (for
               episode three).  The second character specifies the level
               number and must be a key between 'Q' and 'O' on the keyboard,
               where 'Q' means level 1 and 'O' means level 9.

               This debug mode, including the level warp, works in both the
               shareware and registered versions of the game.  However, if you
               try to warp to an episode 2 or 3 level in the shareware version,
               the game will crash.

}+ Misc Command Line Parameters - "rec" followed by a filename will record
}                                 your game.  "play" followed by the filename
}                                 of a recorded game will play it back.


[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike]

+ Cheat Codes - [J] [A] [M] [Enter] - These keys are to be pressed one at a
                time.  When all are pressed, the message "Now you're
                Jammin'" appears, and you will be given all keys and 100%
                health, but your score will be zeroed out.  This will only
                work on the registered version of the game.

+ Cheat Command Line Parameters - The following command line parameters can
                                  be used in both the shareware and registered
                                  versions of the game:

    POWERBALL - Enables debug keys.  This also requires that you hold down the
                left and right shift keys during the JAM Logo intro.  Don't
                hold them down until the white letters start to appear.
                Once the PC-13 screen is loaded, you can let go.  You will hear
                a "ching" sound during the intro when debug mode has been
                successfully enabled.  The "ching" sound will only happen if
                you have a sound card. If you have a PC speaker, you won't hear
                this.
         TICS - Display TIC INFO in score area.
        MUSIC - Enable music test mode: [backspace] [arrows] changes music.
        RADAR - Displays a rotating overhead view during gameplay.  Please note
                that this REALLY slows the game down, to the point of being
                unplayable.

                These cheat keys can be use during gameplay only if you invoked
                the program with the "powerball" parameter:

       [backspace] S - Slow motion
       [backspace] V - Extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do
                                   nothing for most users)
  [backspace] [home] - Dec sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgup] - Inc sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)

           [7] [8] - Kill all actors.
           [6] [8] - Collect all bonus items and kill all actors.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters - These aren't really debug codes, or

       assisting customers who might be having problems running the game.

 HIDDENCARD - Disable checking for video card.

      NO386 - Disable checking for 386.
   ENABLEGP - Enables NoteBook GamePort checking.  (This will do bad things if
                                                    you try it on an Acer.)


[Duke Nukem II]

+ Customer Cheat - For the registered version only, the following two codes
                   can be used during gameplay.  Please note that all three
                   letters have to be pressed at the same time.

  [E] [A] [T] - health is restored to maximum, but score is reset to zero
  [N] [U] [K] - get a random weapon, plus all inventory required to finish
                the current level


[Alien Carnage]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [B] [I] [G] all at the same time will give you
                   full health and jetpack power.

+ Debug Mode - The following debug keys work for version 1.1 of Halloween
               Harry only:

               [ctrl] [R] [E] [N] - Gives you all weapons, and activates
                                    god mode for several seconds.
                        [alt] [L] - Level warp.  Type the number of the
                                    episode (1-4), followed by the number of
                                    the level (1-5).  Illegal input will dump
                                    you to DOS.  This can not be used in the
                                    shareware version to access levels in the
                                    registered version.
                        [alt] [=] - Change location within a level.  Type
                                    coordinates after this code; illegal
                                    input will probably crash the game.

+ Tech Parameters - Pressing these four keys at the same time will show you the
                    coordinates you are at on the level.  This serves no real
                    function on its own, but it is used by Apogee's Game Hint
                    Line sometimes to locate a player in a level.  The keys are
                    [ctrl] [alt] [rshift] [F12]

+ Misc Command Line Parameters - "skip" will start the game directly from the
                                 main menu.


[Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [I] [L] [M] all at the same time, will give you
                   both keys, and will give you 100% health.  It will also
                   take your score to zero.  This cheat will work in both the
                   shareware and the registered version.

+ Debug Mode -

  The debug mode is activated with a different command line parameter
  depending on what version of the game you have.

  v1.0  -> -next
           Once in the game, press [ctrl] [tab] [enter] to activate.

  v1.1+ -> -goobers
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Spear -> -debugmode
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Once activated, these are the keys you can use.

  [tab] [Q] - Quit
  [tab] [W] - Warp to level xx
  [tab] [E] - Exit to next level
  [tab] [T] - Debug info in memory
  [tab] [I] - Free items
  [tab] [O] - Map of level (only works in beta versions of Wolf3D)
  [tab] [S] - Slow motion
  [tab] [F] - Position info
  [tab] [G] - God mode (no damage)
  [tab] [H] - Hurt yourself
  [tab] [X] - Extra stuff (???)
  [tab] [C] - Statistics
  [tab] [V] - Add extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do nothing
                              for most users except maybe increase or decrease
                              the game speed.)
  [tab] [B] - Change border color
  [tab] [M] - Memory map
  [tab] [N] - No clipping (walk through walls)
              (This works only in Wolf3D v1.0 shareware.  This mode can cause
               really bad things to happen to the game, including corrupting
               itself, which is why it was taken out.)

+ Jukebox - Hold down [M] when the game is starting to access a jukebox.  It
            only brings up a few songs at a time; keep on doing this, and
            you'll get a randomly selected list of songs each time.

+ Spear of Destiny only - To get a Gang Screen, choose the window resize
                          option, change the window size, press enter to
                          confirm, then immediately hold down the [I] and [D]
                          keys together.
                        - If you do nothing in the game for 30 seconds, BJ
                          will either cross his eyes or stick his tongue out
                          at you.  It happens quickly, so you have to watch
                          carefully.  You can repeat this as many times as
                          you like.
                        - God mode is accessible in Spear without the use of
                          the -debugmode command line parameter.  Simply hold
                          [tab] [G] [F10] down together to toggle it.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters are the same as in Blake Stone, except
  VERSION, SYSTEM, and ENABLEGP do nothing in Wolf3D.

+ Misc Command Line Parameters - "NOWAIT" will start the game directly from
                                 the main menu.

+ Note:  If you press [B] [A] [T] all at once, you'll get a message asking
         why you're trying to cheat, since this is the old Keen Galaxy cheat
         code.


[Bio Menace]

+ Cheat Codes - In the registered version only, press the following keys at the
                same time to activate the cheat.

  [C] [A] [T] - Get the machine gun, 99 ammo, and 99 grenades.

+ Secret Weapons - The following secret weapons are available in both the
                   shareware and registered versions of the games.

    Super Plasma Bolt - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit fire; this causes one hit point of damage.
      Fireball Attack - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit fire.
      Electron Shield - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit the jump key.
  Invincibility Burst - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit the down arrow.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters -

            COMP - Turn on SVGA compatibility
            NOAL - Disable Adlib sound card detection

[Monster Bash]

+ Cheat Codes - In the registered version only, you can press the [Z] and
                [F10] keys down simultaneously to receive five lives.  Hold
                down [Z] first; since the [F10] key, by itself, has meaning
                in the game, the cheat won't work if you push both down at
                the same time and the [F10] is the first to register.


[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter]

+ Cheat Codes - Pressing the [B] [A] [T] keys all at once will give you 99
                shots, an extra life, and all the gems.  This does not work
                on early versions of Aliens Ate My Babysitter.

+ Debug Codes - Pressing [A] [2] [enter] all at once will activate debug mode.
                (Early versions of the game do not require this step.)
                Once activated, these keys will perform the following
                functions:

    [F10] [G] - God mode.
    [F10] [I] - Free items.
    [F10] [J] - Jump cheat.
    [F10] [N] - No clipping.  (Be careful.  Falling off the bottom of the level
                               will kill you even in God mode.)
    [F10] [Y] - View hidden areas in the level.

    [F10] [C] - Show number of active/inactive objects in the level.

    [F10] [W] - Warp to any level.
    [F10] [Y] - Reveal hidden areas.


[Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons]

+ Cheat Codes - Either of these cheats will work with either the shareware
                or registered versions of the game.  The key combinations
                need to be pressed at the same time.

               [C] [T] [space] - Gives pogostick, all keycards, and full ammo.
                 [shift] [tab] - Pass through an unplayed level on world map.
                   [G] [O] [D] - God mode, plus jump cheat (jumping causes you
                                 to fly).


[Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure]

+ Cheat Codes - Pressing [C] [0] [F10] down simultaneously will give you
                a full health and bombs.  This cheat only works once per game.

                The debug keys are:

    [F10] [G] - God mode.
    [F10] [W] - Warp.
    [F10] [M] - Display memory usage statistics.

+ Command Line Parameters - Give "apogee" on the command line when starting
                            up Cosmo.  The effects of this are many.  One,
                            the game will not recognize your old high
                            scores or saved games.  (The high scores will
                            be reset to those of Simpsons' characters until
                            you exit and re-enter the program normally.)
                            In this mode, if you die quickly enough after
                            entering a level, you'll be invincible from then
                            on, to everything but pits on the bottom of
                            each level.


[Duke Nukem]

+ Debug Codes - To activate, start up the game with "asp" as a command line
                parameter.  (It must be in lower case.)  Once activated, you
                can press the following key combinations inside the game.
                All keys in each combination must be pressed simultaneously.

  [G] [O] [D] - Get full health and all items.

[Major Stryker]

+ Customer Cheat - The cheats here are a bit more complicated than in other
                   games.  There is a two step procedure to active the cheat
                   mode.  (This cheat mode only works in the registered
                   version.  It does nothing in the shareware version.)

                   and then press the [H] & [S] keys at the same
                   time.  When you are successful, you'll see a
                   message that says "Cheat Mode On" (it is now).
                   You can hit these three keys again to turn the
                   cheat mode off.

                 - Once activated, you can press these keys to activate various
                   options.  Please note that you must hold down the [tab] key
                   first before pressing the others, or it won't work.

                versions of the game.

      [L] [Z] - Warp.  When you type this, the screen will
                freeze.  Enter the level number you want to go

[6.2.2]  Hex editing

Editing saved game files is one of the finer methods of cheating.  Below are
the specs for the saved game files for some Apogee games.  To make use of
these specs, you'll need a hex editor (an editor, as opposed to a text
editor, which allows you to directly edit a binary file), and a small dose
of know-how.  If you are not comfortable with computers in general, it is
not recommended that you attempt to cheat in this manner; mistakes editing
these saved game files may cause unpredictable results.  Naturally, neither
Apogee nor I take responsibility for any damage caused by manually editing
saved game files.


[Wacky Wheels]

You can edit the WACKY.CFG file to change a number of different things:

      872H - number of laps, in longints (back up three and use those four
             bytes; remember that longints, integers, and words have
             reversed bytes).
      876H - Difficulty level (1=amateur, 2=pro, 3=champ).
      882H - Your points.
      886H - Opponent's points.
      88AH - Opponent's points.
      88EH - Opponent's points.
      892H - Opponent's points.
      896H - Opponent's points.
      89AH - Opponent's points.
      89EH - Opponent's points.
      87AH - Course group (bronze, silver, etc).
      87EH - Course number (1-5).
      8C3H - Number of porcupines.
      957H - Horsepower of your engine (1=12HP, 2=6HP).

      Changing your character type is slightly more complicated.  First,
      edit location 86AH as follows, remembering your old character number.
             0=Uno,   1=Sultan, 2=Morris, 3=Peggles,
             4=Razer, 5=Ringo,  6=Blombo, 7=Tigi
      At location 8A2H should be the number of your old character.
      Somewhere between 8A6H and 8BEH should be your new character number.
      Switch those bytes, so the one with the new character number has the
      old one in it, and your character number has the new number in it.

Note that changing the course group in the shareware version will not permit
access to the registered version course groups, but will instead crash the
game.


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

With a hex editor, change bytes 27h and 28h of a Raptor saved game file
(char????.fil) to the value FF.  When you load this saved game, you'll have
a few million dollars to spend on equipment.  If you don't have a hex editor,
there are some programs available that do this for you.  The most common
is RapCheat, available in various game cheat archives.

[6.3]  Hints

The following contains some of the most frequently needed hints to various
Apogee games.  In the interest of keeping this FAQ from growing much more than
it already has, it is limited to those hints and clues Apogee is asked for the
most.  This section contains spoilers -- use with caution.

}[6.3.1]  Paganitzu

The solutions to two of the hardest Paganitzu levels, 1-12 and 1-19, follow.

Paganitzu Episode 1 - level 12:

12   + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     k -- key

     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P

You begin at the point P-11.  First, we'll concentrate on clearing the left
side of the map and getting the 4 keys.  Remove the rubble at K-11, then go
to B-9.  Push the rock at B-8 up one space, then push the rock at D-8 up
one space.  Then move to D-8 and push the rock at C-8 to the left.  The
left side of the map should now look like this:

1    + + + + +
2    = & & & &
3    + k k k +
4    +       +

10   + + + + +
11   +   #
12   + + + + +

     A B C D E

Get the key at C-7, then repeat the same steps for the next set of 3
boulders (i.e. push the rocks at B-5 and D-5 up one space, then push the
rock at C-5 to the left and get the keys.

Notice how this leaves you with 2 usable rocks, now located at D-7 and D-4.
We'll come back to them; now it's time for the right side of the screen.

Prepare by pushing the rock at I-10 up one space, then release the spider
by clearing the rubble at F-11.  Keep out of his way, and as soon as
possible, go stand at H-9, directly to the left of the rock you just pushed
up.  When the spider begins going down the "corridor" of L,M,N,O-9, follow
him with the rock.  Here's what the right side of the screen should look
like:

1   + + + + + + + + +
2   & & & & & & & & +
3   + + + + + D D D !
4   + + k   + D k D +
5   S S     + D D D +
6           +       +       where you are " (at) " at H-9, pushing the rock at
7           + R * R +       I-9 to the right as the spider goes down the
8         S + * * * +       "corridor" from L-9 to O-9
9    (at)  *      #      +

11        R         (
12  + + + + + + + + +

    H I J K L M N O P

When you trap the spider at O-9 with the rock, he will explode, turning
himself, the rock at O-8, and the rock you were pushing at N-9 into
diamonds.  Move into the area, and get the diamonds and key.  Notice now
that you have 3 usable rocks available to you, at M-8, N-8, and N-7.

You now have enough rocks to proceed.  Use the 4 rocks from the right side
of the screen, (if you mess anything up, you've got two extra rocks on the
left side) to block the snakes, get the final keys, and exit the level.

Throughout this message, I'll refer to a trick I'll call "the technique"
which is essentially, pushing a rock from below or from its right side up
to the coordinates I-4, moving yourself to H-4, then pushing the rock to
the right, then down.  "The technique" is useful for getting rocks in a
position where you can push them from its left side.  But more about that
later.  Here we go.

First, avoiding the spider, push the rock at E-6 up one space, then push
the rock at D-8 up and to the right one space (so it ends up at E-7).  Keep
out of the spiders way until he enters the small "nook" area you created at
E-6 - when he does that, push the rock at C-6 in behind him.  The spider,
trapped by the rocks and the pipeline, will explode, turning the rocks and
the pipe into diamonds and opening a passage to the right side of the
screen.

Next, on the right side of the screen, push the rock at I-9 to the left
against the wall, then push the rock at I-8 up to I-4.  Now use "the
technique" to get that rock down to J-7.  So far so good?

Push the rock at J-7 to K-7, so it will be a few spaces directly above
the spears.  Now comes a semi-tricky part.  You must run and push the
rock that is at L-8 to M-8.  If you do it right, the spears will shoot up
and miss you, hitting the rock you left at K-7 earlier.  Now you should be
at L-8, and the rock that was formerly there should be at M-8. (Make sure
didn't push the rock too far -- if it ended up at N-8 or O-8 instead of
M-8, you'll have to start over!)

Now, go down and dissolve the wall at M-11 (just run into it) and get the
key at L-11 (the snake can't attack since the discharged spears are in his
way.  Now, push the rock at M-10 to N-10, then push it up into the water at
N-6.  Next, push the rock at M-8 to N-8, push the rock at M-9 down to M-10
to get it out of your way, then push the rock at N-8 up into the water at
N-5, and push the rock at M-10 up into the water at M-6.

Now you'll need to use the rock at K-7 which the spears hit earlier.  Don't
worry; the spears won't come up any further after you move the rock.
Standing to the right of the rock at K-7, use "the technique" to move the
rock over and up to I-4, over to J-4, then back down to J-7.  Push the rock
over to M-7, then up into the water at M-5.  Finally, push the rock at L-9
up to L-7, then use "the technique" to manipulate it like the others, until
you can push it (from its left side) over to N-7; then push it up to N-4 to
block the snake.

After that, the rest is easy.  Walk up through the gap at M-6 and M-5, grab
the key, head back down, grab the key at O-7 and turn and run QUICKLY before
the spikes hit you (it can be done!), then head for the exit!

}[6.3.2]  Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter

The following procedures tell you how to get to the secret levels in episodes
4-6 of the Commander Keen series.  The text was adapted from a procedure
written by Joe Siegler.

Episode 4:  To get to the Pyramid of the Forbidden (the hidden pyramid with
the hand on it), go to the Pyramid of the Moons level, get the yellow crystal
and go to the room that has twelve inchworms in it.  To the left is an open
passageway with some inchworms to the left of it.  All the way to the right of
this bottom room is a door that needs the yellow crystal.  Go through the door
and flip the switch behind it.  The left trapdoor will close over allowing all
the inchworms to gather.

Get the twelve inchworms together in one spot.  When you are near them, they
will follow you; if they are off-screen, they'll lose track of you.  When
the twelve are gathered together, a foot will form above your head.  Jump on
the foot, and it will take you to the hidden pyramid.

While you're in the hidden pyramid, you won't be allowed to play any other
levels until you finish that one.  When the hidden pyramid level is completed,
the foot will be there again.  Jump on it, and you'll be transported to the
outside of the Pyramid of the Moons, and you can continue with your game.

To get outside the Pyramid of the Moons, you need to go all the way to
the left of the room where the inchworms are.  There will be four guns
in the ceiling shooting down.  To the left of them is a hole in the
ceiling you can jump into.  Do that, and there will be a pole in there (that
you can't see) that you can grab onto.  Save your game, since it's easy
to die in here.  Follow the passageway and you'll see a door.  You can
go into that door if you want; there's a free life.  Come back through
and jump into the ceiling above that door, and follow a passageway in
the wall.  You'll come out to a doorway with a bunch of ice cream
cones in front of it.  Go through that door, and you're outside the
pyramid.

However, if you exit this level before going to the hidden pyramid,
you won't be able to get to the hidden pyramid, since this level
(Pyramid of the Moons) will be considered finished, and you won't be
able to get back in.

Episode 5:  Stand in the archway near the end of the level in the "Gravitional
Dampening Hub".  You will not be able to see yourself in there.  You'll need
to do the down jump maneuver, which is holding the down arrow and pressing
jump.  You will fall into the floor below you.  You will then need to walk to
the left, as far as you can go.  Since you will not be able to see yourself,
the only way to know it's working is if the screen starts moving.  If, when
you start moving left, you appear again next to the arch, you didn't do the
down jump maneuver right.

Once you walk to the leftmost part of the level, you'll fall all the way to
the bottom of the level.  Once you stop falling, walk to the right, and you'll
appear again.  SAVE YOUR GAME HERE!   The passageway that you're in leads to
a teleporter, which will take you to the secret level.  There are no more
secrets along the way here, but there is a LOT of stuff that will kill you,
which is why you should save beforehand.

Also, there is a bug in the secret level of Keen 5.  Once you get there, if
you look around hard enough, you'll find a transistor that you're supposed to
pogo on and break.  Sometimes you'll not be able to break it.  Apogee never
found why this happens.  Sometimes it will work; sometimes it won't.  If you
do break it, the end game story will say that the Shikadi ship blew up;
otherwise, it will say that it got away.

Episode 6:  This is the easiest one of them all.  Right before the final level
of the game, when you're on the world map, you'll see a somewhat large blue
towering thing that looks like a cross between a hut and a mouth.  If you look
beyond it, you'll see a yellow fence.  If you walk through the mouth and out
the other side, you'll come to the fence (don't enter the level; going in the
mouth and pressing space will put you into the level).  Stay on the world map,
and wait there a minute or two.  A spaceship will come around, pick you up,
and will take you to the secret level.  When you're done with the secret
level, wait for the ship again, and it will take you back.  An English
translation of the Galactic Alphabet is in a hidden area in this level.

}[6.3.3]  Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition

A particularly difficult part of "Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition" is finding
the red keycard in Episode 4, Level 4 ("Babe Land").  The red keycard can
be found from the shooting gallery.  You must shoot the second and fourth
circular targets -- this will open a space behind the stuffed prizes.  Shoot
the toys and drop inside, and you'll find the keycard.

}[6.3.4]  Stargunner

A feature of Stargunner that gamers frequently overlook is that games may
be saved mid-level.  You may hit [F2] at any time to save your game.
Mid-level saved games are not uncommon in Apogee games, but, it is
occasionally missed in Stargunner because the feature is not heavily
advertised within the game, and Stargunner's precedessor, Raptor, did not
have this feature.  Nevertheless, saving mid-level is often essential for
solving Stargunner, as the game can be very difficult even on the easiest
difficulty setting.

It is also worth noting that, since Stargunner keeps track of each individual
player that uses the game, it is able to provide eight saved games slots
*per player*.  And, since you are not given unlimited lives as with many
other Apogee games and must converse lives whenever possible, it is
highly recommended that you make use of each and every one of those eight
saved game slots instead of overwriting the previous saved game each time.
This way, if you ever get cornered in a spot where you absolutely cannot
proceed without more lives than you have, you can backtrack as far back as
necessary and try to do better.

[6.4]  Secrets and Other Fun Things

Frequently, game programmers will embed little fun things into their games.
Usually, these things would not crop up under ordinary game play.  Sometimes
it requires doing certain things, typing certain codes, or even activating
the program on a particular day or time.  Sometimes these little things are
called "easter eggs."  Below are some such things that can be found in some
of Apogee's games, and the instructions for getting to them.

}[6.4.1]  Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!

In Keen: Galaxy, episode 4, go to the level entitled "Pyramid of the Moons,"
and from there, to the half moons painted on the floor.  If you stand on
these and do nothing for a while, Keen will moon you, instead of his usual
idle activity of reading a book.  This will only happen once per game,
however.

Also, in all episodes of Commander Keen, signs are written in an alien
language.  The comment is made, "too bad you don't know the language."  Well,
now you do.  The language is a simple symbol substitution, the key of which
is given below.  This key appears only twice in all the Keen games; in the
secret areas of the secret levels of episodes three and six.

 #     #     # #   ###          #     #

}[6.4.2]  Raptor: Call of the Shadows

Raptor was written by Cygnus, and it seems to be a birthday present to
themselves.  Whenever Raptor is started when your system's clock matches the
birthday of one of the people at Cygnus, Raptor behaves a little strangely.
Here's the list of recognized birthdays.  You can reset your system clock
to one of these dates manually, if you wish; any year should be all right,
so long as it's not in the past:

                       March 12        Bobby Prince
                       May 16          Scott Host
                       August 28       Rich Fleider
                       October 2       Jim Molinets

Note that in v1.0 of Raptor, Bobby Prince's birthday was not recognized,
while Tim Neveu's was.

What happens is this:  first, the Apogee logo is displayed, but not with
Apogee's trademark music.  Instead, you hear the Cygnus folks, sounding a
little tipsy, humming the Apogee theme music themselves.  In version 1.1 and
1.2, Bobby Prince says, "You boys just don't get it, do ya?" immediately
}afterward.  (This file is available online in WAV format; the direct URL is
}http://www.apogee1.com/sounds/rapgoof.wav.  You'll also hear it if you go to
}the Raptor product catalog entry in Apogee's web site and click on the cursor
}in Raptor's main menu.)  In addition, some of the Raptor levels contain
enemies that don't normally appear such as monkeys who throw coconuts at you,
raptor dinosaurs scurrying across the screen, and cows with machine guns
concealed beneath their hides.  Most of these peculiar enemies appear on the
first mission of the game, and they are usually difficult to kill.

Finally, when you exit the game, you get to hear the member of Cygnus whose
birthday it is give an impersonation of a monkey.  This might consist of
hooting or screeching sounds, or simply an eloquent rendering of the word
"monkey."  (The raucous you hear when monkeys appear during the game are
all the monkey impersonations playing together at random.)

There is a way, beyond setting the system time to a particular birthday, of
getting the monkeys and raptors and cows to fight you.  When the screen comes
up where you must choose a sector to fly, flip the switch at the bottom center
of the screen by clicking on it with the mouse.  It should darken.  This
activates the three lights to the right of this switch.  In version 1.0 of
Raptor, you should turn on the first and third lights; in v1.1 and v1.2 of
Raptor, you should turn all three lights on.  Then you can select a sector or
"auto pilot" and fly the level.  You'll know the cheat worked if you hear a
static-like sound.  All levels have some new enemy that appears by using this
cheat, though sometimes they are small and inconspicuous.  Besides monkeys,
cows, and raptors, there are:  the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship
from Space 1999, pedestrians, a woman sunbathing on a roof, and other
miscellaneous items.

Note, however, that if you activate the "battle cow" mode using the switches,
as opposed to running the game on a Cygnus birthday, you don't get the goofy
Apogee theme song in the beginning, nor the individual monkey impersonation
at the end.

}[6.4.3]  Wacky Wheels

To see the Dopefish, a creature from Commander Keen, start any single player
race.  When everybody else moves, stand still.  Hold down the break, and turn
left all the way around until the Dopefish shows up.  Note:  the lion that
starts the race must remain on the screen the entire time; otherwise, the
Dopefish won't appear.  You can do this as many times as you like, so long
as the lion doesn't leave the screen.

Also, in the shareware version of the game, there are two ways to play the
track shown in the ordering information of the shareware game, which is
supposed to be a track available only in the registered version.  One way
is to play in Championship Mode; you will play that track as a bonus.  The
sneakier way is to exploit a loophole.  Start a new game, and complete
track 1.  Save the game, and quit to the main menu.  Now look at the ordering
information.  Go back to the main menu, restore the saved game, and voila.

}[6.4.4]  Rise of the Triad

If you start ROTT when your system clock indicates that it's one of five
different holidays, the "group picture" of the five main characters is
changed slightly.  In addition, on Christmas, the music for the first
level is changed to a familiar Christmas tune.  The holidays and effects
are as follows:

   Easter             <varies>    Lorelei Ni wears Easter Bunny ears.
   Cinco de Mayo       05/05      Ian wears a sombrero.
   Independence Day    07/04      Doug holds an American flag.
   Halloween           10/31      Thi wears a witch's hat.
   Christmas           12/24      Taradino wears a Santa Claus hat; new music
                       12/25      for the first level.

Also, there's a way to get all five "holiday hats" in Rise of the Triad to
show up on the screen at the same time.  If you finish the game the right way,
and destroy all the larvae in the last level, watch ALL the credits (takes
several minutes).  You'll get to a screen that says "The HUNT is victorious.
The End."  Do nothing.  Let it sit there for about a minute or two, and
you'll get another "The End" screen where all five "holiday hats" are shown
at once.

A second amusing way to start Rise of the Triad is to supply "DOPEFISH" as a
command line parameter ("ROTT DOPEFISH").  This causes Scott Miller's mystical
head to appear on the main screen.  Lee Jackson's musical composition "Fish
Polka" will play.  Joe Siegler will burp.  Tom Hall will say "O," "K," or
"Boy" as you move around the menu.  And the names of the levels will be a
little sillier than usual.

In the secret level "Eight Ways To Hell" (episode 3, area 8), designed by
Joe Siegler (a noted and revered Dopefish follower), there's a hidden area
about half way through the level.  It's a long, narrow hallway with
boulders running down the middle and elasto-modes on the sides.  There's
a touchplate at the beginning of the hallway which, when triggered, will
open up a secret room.  The gray walls in the middle of the secret room
spell a message written in the Commander Keen language (see the Keen
secrets section, below).  Look at all the gray walls from all angles, or
use the \MAP cheat (see the cheats section).  Then look at the map to see
the letters.  Translated, it says, "Dopefish Lives!"

Bosses play big roles in Rise of the Triad.  There are four, one at the end
of each episode, and arranged in order of weakest to strongest.  There are
ways to kill two of the bosses that the programmers at Apogee never thought
to try.  These "loopholes" are "fixed" in version 1.3 of ROTT, but version 1.2a
and previous versions still have the loopholes.  For Sebastian "Doyle"
Krist, you can lure him out of the room by hitting the touch plate diagonally
away and to the right of the gold door as you enter it.  The triggering the
touchplate will block the gold door and open a passageway.  Lure Krist
through here carefully, then through the brown door.  Then go up the
staircase!  Krist, in his wheelchair will follow you up.  However, due to
a bug in Krist's programming (he was never intended to ascend stairs), he
won't fall back down to the ground.  He'll fire missiles at you, but if you're
safely beneath him, they won't hit you.  Shoot him until he's dead.  You can
also lure the NME out of the room he starts in, but if he's led into the
nearby spinblades, the game will crash (this bug, by the way, was *not* fixed
in ROTT version 1.3, so be careful).

The second loophole involves the final boss, El Oscuro, in his final form
(the snake-like form).  Get a firebomb and an asbestos vest.  Then find
El Oscuro and lure him into a corner.  Keep the corner at your back.  Aim
the firebomb down and fire it -- this will thrust you up into the air.
Land on El Oscuro and wait for him to exhaust himself.  (The intended method
of killing him is to not fire at him at all, but dodge his own attacks until
he dies of exhaustion.  In all his forms, firing at him simply makes him
stronger!  Note, however, that El Oscuro can be hurt by the firepits, so
luring him over those is another technique for doing him in.

}The boss monster for episode 2 of the registered version, Sebastian Doyle
}Krist, is a reference to the British comedy series, "Red Dwarf."  In the
}last episode of Season 5, entitled "Back To Reality," there is an alternate
}reality where the Dave Lister character is called "Colonel Sebastian Doyle."
}Red Dwarf fan Joe Siegler (who was also the one photographed for the Doyle
}Krist character) tried to get project leader Tom Hall to call Krist "Colonel
}Sebastian Doyle Krist," but Tom "wouldn't go for it."

It's hard to see, but there's a license plate on the back of the NME (the boss
monster for episode 3 of the registered version).  It looks like a Texas
license plate that says "Spray."  (Spray is the NME's nickname, given by the
ROTT developement team.)

Several people have run across the curious message "I'm Free" while playing
ROTT and don't know what it means.  If you get this, you're probably playing
either the "This Causes An Error" level in the registered version, or you're
playing a user-made level.  The cause of the note is whenever a moving wall
crosses the boundary of a level and just keeps on going.  The game detects the
problem, but, before crashing with a regular error message, manages to put up
the picture saying, "I'm Free" (drawn by Tom Hall).  The "This Causes An
Error" level, originally titled "WanderWall Bug Map," has a pushwall in it
that leaves the level, crashing the game with the "I'm Free" message.
In the rejected ROTT levels (ROTT_REJ.ZIP), there is a level called "This
Causes An Error Too."

What all this is, is a manifestation of in-house humor.  If you don't get it,
that's good, because you're not supposed to.  It's one of those "you had to
be there" things.  At any rate, the story goes...during the development of
ROTT, when a level was tested wherein a pushwall was inadvertantly directed
out of the level bounds, Joe Selinske, former member of Apogee, joked, saying,
"I'm free."  He probably wishes he hadn't, for all the confusion it's caused
customers who have run across it -- either that, or, if he were more like me,
he feels a deep sense of satisfaction in having successfully dumbfounded a
significant enough percentage of the gaming community to warrant mention in
FAQs such as this one.

Joe Selinske's response to the above paragraph is quoted below:

Yes, you are right.  I do get deep satisfaction and a lot of laughs thinking
back to when that whole "I'm Free" gag was running around Apogee.  I am the
bastard who started it, Tom [Hall] drew it, Joe [Siegler] scanned it in and
Mark [Dochtermann] put it in the game.  There were so many things going on
during ROTT development that it scares me to think about them.  Wow, that
was some fun.  But way too many inside jokes if you ask me.  ;)

}[6.4.5]  Terminal Velocity

When you start a new game in the registered CD version, you can get to the
hidden planet by entering "Terminal" as your name and "Reality" as your
call sign.  (Both of these are case sensitive.)  Before you start playing
the hidden planet, a message appears saying you are flying the TV-302, a
new, experimental ship.  As far as gameplay is concerned, no, you're not
flying a new ship; this is simply an element of the game's storyline.
The hidden planet is not in the shareware version or the disk based
registered version.

Also, in level 3-1 of Terminal Velocity, fly close to the ground near the
coordinates (63,227).  You will see a photographic image of the Terminal
Reality team.  If you fly too high, the fog will obstruct the view.  A
clearer version of this can be found as a GIF file on the Terminal
Velocity CD in the PREVIEW directory.

}[6.4.6]  XenoPhage: Alien Bloodsport

In the registered version, type "xacman" at the menu screen to play a subgame
similar to Pac-Man.

Also in the registered version, you can fight the secret boss Blarney by
typing "blarney" at any menu screen.

Other tricks can be done with the XPR.INI file:  change BloodVolume to 499998
to get more blood than even the BLOOD cheat code.  Change "Type" in both the
FPPlayer1 and FPPlayer2 sections to "2" (the joystick) to get your opponent to
mirror your punches and kicks (but not movement).

[6.5]  Troubleshooting

[6.5.1]  Things to try first

If you have a program with an Apogee game not starting correctly, there are a
few things you can try.  First, make sure your system meets the hardware
requirements of the game.  If they don't, you probably can't run the game
without upgrading your hardware.

Second, make sure you have the most recent version of the game.  Many older
versions of games have bugs that are fixed in the most recent versions.

Third, if there is a XXXXHELP.EXE file that came with the game, read it.
(Most registered Apogee games have such a file on the first game disk;
with shareware versions, you might find it there and possibly in the directory
the game was installed to as well.)  This file will contain numerous common
technical problems with their solutions.

Fourth, check the Apogee web site.  Common technical support questions and
their answers are posted there (at http://www.apogee1.com/tech/) in
addition to the contents of the XXXXHELP.EXE files for many games.

If you're running under Windows 95, that may be the problem.  Check the Apogee
web site for information on booting to DOS when Windows 95 is installed on
your system (at http://www.apogee1.com/tech/multiboot.html).  While
several Apogee games do run under Windows 95, some don't, and none are
guaranteed to do so.

If the game is failing to start due to insufficient memory, you can try
removing TSRs, or booting "clean."  With MS-DOS 6.0 or greater, you can do
this by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the system is booting.
This causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be bypassed.  If you
are running a memory manager, try removing the manager altogether; this
seems to fix most problems Apogee games have with EMS/XMS memory.  Additional
suggestions on how to free up memory may be in the XXXXHELP.EXE file.

Also, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some
games, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the
game.  Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.

If you problem is your Soundblaster card (or a Soundblaster emulating card),
then the problem may be the settings on the card or the BLASTER environment
variable.  Check the section on that subject below.

With regard to drive compression, Apogee has tested their entire product
line with Stacker 3.1, Stacker 4.0, and MS-DOS 6.22's DriveSpace.  The
products all worked fine, with the following exceptions:   Monster Bash
suffered a slowdown using DriveSpace.  The install procedure for the Rise
of the Triad CD version 1.2a does not work under any drive compression
program, but the game may be installed manually and will run fine.

If you've tried everything and still can't get an Apogee game to work
correctly, contact Apogee's technical support services.  These are listed
under "Contacting Apogee."

[6.5.2]  Setting the BLASTER environment variable

This section may be useful if you are having problems with sound or music in
an Apogee game.
 
Apogee games that use Soundblasters look at the BLASTER environment variable
to figure out where to send its sound output.  Check to make sure that you
have the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This code is an example
and probably isn't exactly what you need to put in your system.
 
NOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of
      cards.  For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE 32.  The
      minimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters.  The other
      three may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.
      Please read this entire section to see if you need any of them.  If you
      are using a clone card, or some card that's not a "true" Soundblaster,
      then you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3 P330 H6 E620
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |_______ AWE 32 Only Parameter
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |__________ "High" DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |_______________ MIDI Port
 |    |     |    |  |  |__________________ Type of Card
 |    |     |    |  |_____________________ DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |________________________ Interrupt
 |    |     |_____________________________ Port Address
 |    |___________________________________ Environment Variable
 |________________________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).
If you have a space in there, your system will read the parameter incorrectly,
and it will not be recognized by our games.

Now, these may not (most likely not) be the same for your board, because the
Port Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by adjusting "jumpers" on
your sound board.  Some newer cards have this information controlled by
software, please consult your card's manual for more information on how to set
these things.  You should also check your manual if you are unclear as to how
to tell what settings your card is set at.  The information *IS* important, so
it's recommended that you know precisely what the settings are.  If you are
using a card that "emulates" the Soundblaster (such as the Gravis UltraSound
through software, or the PAS16), you should check your card's manual on how to
set the card for Soundblaster emulation.

For PORT ADDRESS, it's almost always 220.  That seems to be the default for
most sound cards out there, and unless you know you've switched it away from
220, it's a safe bet it's still there.

The INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system.  Mystic Towers
and games prior to Raptor require that your IRQ be set at 7 or less.  Apogee
does not recommend using IRQ2, as it causes problems.

The DMA CHANNEL sometimes causes problems if it isn't set to 1, which is the
}usual default.  If it is not set correctly, some Apogee games may lock up
}when the sound is turned on.

The TYPE OF CARD should be 1 if you have an older Soundblaster, or a Sound
Blaster emulating card.  Use 3 if you have a newer plain Soundblaster.  Use
2 for an older Soundblaster Pro.  Use 4 for a newer Soundblaster Pro.

The MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has
MIDI capabilites.  If so, this is where you define what MIDI port you are
using.  330 seems to be the default, so if you have a MIDI card, and you
haven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably where it still
is.

The HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Soundblaster 16
cards.  This is not the same as the standard DMA channel, this is a different
one.  This is only used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing
16 bit Soundblaster sounds.  By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know
that it's something else, it's probably still 5.

The E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative
Labs AWE 32 sound card.  If you have one of these, this parameter will have
been set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the
card.  Check your AWE 32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what
this parameter is used for.

}Note on the Soundblaster AWE64:  The AWE64 will not always correctly set up
}its sound drivers for use in Windows 95 in relation to DOS games.  There is
}information on how to get around this in the README.TXT file that is installed
}on your hard drive in the AWE64 driver directory.

[6.5.3]  Slowing down your computer to play old games

A great deal of old games do not take the speed of the computer they are
running on into account.  Hence, when an older game runs on a fast computer,
it either crashes with a runtime error, or it runs so fast that it's difficult
or impossible to play.

This problem is usually fixed by temporarily slowing down your computer to a
speed where the game will function properly.  Some computers have an internal
slow-down feature -- check your computer's manual to see if there is, and if
so, how to use it.  Otherwise, you can run a simple program that will do this.
Apogee recommends "Mo'Slo," which is a freeware program available at, among
other places, the Apogee FTP site, under the filename MOSLO12.ZIP.  (However,
"Mo'Slo" is not made nor supported by Apogee.)

Some of Apogee's earliest games will require the use of this program on fast
computers.  These include "Math Rescue," "Word Rescue," "Dark Ages,"
"Monuments of Mars," "Arctic Adventure," "Pharaoh's Tomb," and "The Kroz
Series."
