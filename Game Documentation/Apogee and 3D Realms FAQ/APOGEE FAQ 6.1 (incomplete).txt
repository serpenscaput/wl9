[3.2.2]  Working titles of Apogee games

Sometimes, over the course of a game's development, the game's title can
change, once, twice, or more.  Here is a list of some of Apogee's games with
their former titles.  Where more than one former title is present, they are
listed in chronological order.

      From Apogee:

 Official Title                                                  Working Title
 --------------                                                  -------------

 Rise of the Triad                                     Wolfenstein 3D: Part II
 Raptor: Call of the Shadows                                    Mercenary 2029
 Bio Menace                                                         Bio Hazard
 Monster Bash                                                        Graveyard
 Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure                               The Adventures of Zonk

      From 3D Realms:

 Official Title                                                  Working Title
 --------------                                                  -------------
}Shadow Warrior                                                   Ninja Master
 Terminal Velocity                                              Velocity Brawl

Sometimes games start out as Apogee games (or at least intended to be Apogee
games) but end up being distributed by another company.  Frequently, these,
too, undergo title changes before, during, or after the move from Apogee.
These games, with their working titles, are given below.

 Official Title           Working Title                  Company
 --------------           -------------                  -------

}Descent                  Inferno                        Interplay
 Sango Fighter            Violent Vengeance              Panda Entertainment  *
 Doom                     It's Green & Pissed            id Software

 * - Sango Fighter had already been released; Apogee was merely going to be
     its U.S. distributor, marketing the game under the title "Violent
     Vengeance."  This did not pan out.  The game was later released in the
     U.S. by Panda Entertainment under the original "Sango Fighter" title.

[3.2.2.1]  Alternate titles for Wolfenstein 3D

The following were all alternate titles for Wolfenstein 3D that Tom Hall
came up with.  Many, however, are joke titles and were never seriously
considered -- hence why these names are separate from those in the section
above.  The information comes from the Official Hint Manual for
Wolfenstein 3D.

Castle Ochtenstein, Luger's Run, The Fourth Reich, Adolph's Bane, Hard Cell,
Luger Me Now, Tank You Very Much, Castle Hasselhoff, How Do You Duseldorf?,
Castle Verlassen (to abandon the castle), Sturmwind (stormwind), Hollehammer
(hellhammer; this name made it in to the game as the name of the castle in
episode two), Shattensendener (shadowsender), Geruchschlect (bad smell),
Dolchteufel (devildagger), Grabgrabbener (gravedigger), Eisenschwert
(ironsword), Dammerung (twilight/dawn).

Since the above information first appeared in this FAQ, Bernd Wolffgramm,
from Germany, sent me further information about Wolfenstein 3D's names,
including spelling corrections.  (Some of the spelling mistakes resulted from
missing umlauts; an alternate spelling for German words containing vowels with
umlauts is to follow the vowel with an 'e' instead using the accent.)

       - "Duseldorf" should be "Duesseldorf," a town on the Rhine river
         famous for its beer (Altbier).
       - "Hollehammer" should be "Hoellenhammer."
       - "Shattensendener" should be "Schattenspender."
       - "Geruchschlect" should be "Geruchschlecht."
       - "Grabgrabbener," is redundant; the word "grab," meaning "grave," is
         used twice.  A more appropriate word would be "Totengraeber."
       - "Dammerung" should be "Daemmerung."

Bernd Wolffgramm also provides further information.  Since the game is
banned in Germany because it involves Nazis and killing Germans, those who
want to play the game have come up with special codewords for it.  The most
common is "Hundefelsen 4C."  If you translate "Wolfenstein" into the German
words that comprise it, you get "Wolfstorm."  "Wolf" is the same word in
German, and "stein" means "stone" or "rock."  "Hundefelsen" is a combination
of the German words for "dog" and "wolf," and "felsen" is a synonym for
"stein."  Hence the alias, "Hundefelsen."

[3.2.3]  Cancelled projects

Frequently, projects that get started never get finished.  This can happen for
a number of reasons.  Legal problems is one common cause; slow progress and
little promise is another.  What follows is a list of projects that, for one
reason or another, never saw the light of day.  Dates are approximations of
the time each game spent under development at Apogee.

      From Apogee:

[3.2.4]  Early games by the staff

Before joining Scott and Apogee in 1990, George Broussard had several projects
of his own.  The most notable were marketed under the name Micro F/X; some of
these later became the property of Apogee (such as "Pharaoh's Tomb" and
"Arctic Adventure").  Broussard also made a game for the Amiga, "The Rings
of ZON," which was like a more intellectual Boulderdash.

Other games written by George Broussard and others were written for Softdisk;
details for these projects are given in the section on Apogee's relationship
with Softdisk.

[3.3]  Previews

[3.3.1]  What slide shows are currently available?

}Apogee no longer releases formal slide shows of their games.  Screen shots
}are now regularly featured on the Apogee web site.  These old slide shows,
}however, still exist and may be found on various web and FTP sites.

     Gods" are old and not representative of the finished productions.
     "Ruins: Return of the Gods" was a project 3D Realms used to have under
     production but which was later cancelled.

[4.2.3]  Cameos

Frequently, the star of one Apogee game will make a cameo appearance in
another.  Or, sometimes, someone from the real world shows up.  A list of
such cameos follows.  Appearances of Apogee characters in the default
scoreboards of games are not mentioned here, however, since there would be
too many to list.

      WARNING: much of the fun of these games is running across these
      things during play.  Do not read this section if you want to be

[4.3.7]  Advertising layouts

Robert Atkins and Michael Hadwin are responsible for all Apogee advertising
layouts in magazines, manuals, flyers, and so forth.  Originally, Steve Maines
held the position, but, when he left, he was replaced by Robert Atkins.
Michael Hadwin came aboard in the summer of 1995.    Atkins and Hadwin left
the company in mid 1996; afterward, all layouts and manual designs (with the
occasional exception, such as Joe Siegler's design of the Stargunner manual)
were done by GT Interactive.

[5.1.5]  Fidonet

If you are a Fidonet SysOp, you can get Apogee's games on the Fido Filebone.
Talk to your local filebone hub about the Apogee FDN areas.  See FILEBONE.NA
for more information.  Send netmail to 1:124/9006 for more information on
these areas.

[5.2]  The Registered Episodes

The registered versions of the software are the complete versions, and, as
they are not shareware, cannot legally exist on public BBS's or FTP sites.
The registered versions of the software must be purchased directly from Apogee
or from one of Apogee's dealers.  The best way to get the most recent ordering
information is by checking the company's web site.  The direct URL to
ordering information is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/order.html.  The direct
URL to pricing information is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/prices.html.

[5.2.1]  Ordering information

To order directly from Apogee, call 1-800-APOGEE1.
To order directly from 3D Realms, call 1-800-3DREALMS.

The lines are open 24 hours a day.  They'll need to know what disk size you
desire, the best graphics mode you are able to run (CGA, EGA, VGA, SVGA), and
whether you have an XT, 286, 386, 486, or Pentium.  Note that some games have
minimum CPU and graphics requirements.  As of mid 1994, new Apogee games are
only available on 3 1/2" HD disks and/or CD; older games that were available
on 5 1/4" HD disks will remain that way.  DD disks will only be shipped if the
entire registered series fits on that disk size.

Use the ORDER.FRM file, which comes with virtually all of Apogee's games
and is also available separately in most Apogee forums, if you want to send
in an order by mail.

For Apogee orders, send mail to:

    Apogee Software, Ltd.
    P.O. Box 496389,
    Garland TX 75049-6389
    United States of America

return fax number if you make use of this facility.

[5.2.2]  What combination deals does Apogee offer?

[5.3]  Other Products

T-shirts, mouse pads, etc.  Generally, the availability of these items is
limited and changing; it is thus not practical to include the specifics in
this FAQ.  However, you may obtain timely information at the Apogee web site.

[6.2]  Cheating

Apogee has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games, both
documented and undocumented.  Sometimes these cheats are available in all
versions of the game; other times they are only available in the registered
version.  From 1987 to around May 1993, Apogee games came with a hint sheet,
which often contained cheats in them.  From May 1993 to December 1993, Apogee
games were shipped with a XXXXHINT.EXE file, which had the same text as the
old hint sheets.  Beginning in 1994, the XXXXHINT.EXE files are done away
with too; the information is now contained in the actual game manuals.
Sometimes, however, cheats are mentioned in XXXXHELP.EXE files which
previously contained strictly technical support information.

The cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.
The customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or
game manual that comes with the game.  Some of the games also have a debugging
mode, which is not generally documented.  Their original purpose is to aid in
the beta testing of the game.  Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is
left intact, available for the regular game-player to use.  Finally, there are
technical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to
correct some technical problems.

[6.2.1]  Complete cheat list

This section contains a variety of cheats from various Apogee games.
Actually, in the words of Joe Siegler, it's "the first comprehensive cheat
[list] ever published for all Apogee titles."

Note that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by Apogee,
the debug keys are not.  If you use the debug keys, Apogee cannot provide
any support, since this alters game performance to a state where their
standard support comments and issues might not apply.  In short, neither
Apogee or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug
keys.  (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing
happening, save where expressly noted below.)

                       - save the game and quit to the main menu
                       - look at the ordering information
                       - go back to main menu and restore the saved game


[Mystic Towers]

+ Cheat Codes - Cheats are activated by typing "BALDRIC" during a level.
                Once actived, your score is reset to zero, and you can
                press the following key combos to achieve what is listed:

[lshift] R xx - where xx is a number of a room to jump to (01-45)  *
   [lshift] H - to get maximum health, also food and drink
   [lshift] K - to get all keys except the end tower key           *
   [lshift] W - to get full weapons                                *
   [lshift] C - to get ten coins                                   *

        * These cheats work in the registered version of the game only.


[Hocus Pocus]

+ Cheat Codes - For each of the following codes, type each letter by letter:

     feelgood - get full health
        blake - get both keys
       banana - get laser shots (registered version only)
        quark - get rapid fire (registered version only)


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

+ Cheat Codes - The backspace key will restore all your energy and give
                you a death ray, at the cost of all your money.  This
                will only work in the registered version.

+ Debug Mode - Set the environment variable "S_HOST" to the value "CASTLE"
               at the DOS prompt by typing "SET S_HOST=CASTLE" (it must be
               in caps).  Then, when you play Raptor, you become completely
               invincible, and have all the weapons at your disposal.  In
               addition, you can skip levels by starting them, hitting
               [esc], followed by [n]; you'll be returned to the hangar, and
               when you exit again, you'll be on the next level.

               While in debug mode, you can make use of a level warp.  From
               the level selection screen (Bravo Sector, etc), type a two
               character combination, one key at a time, that specifies which
               level you wish to jump to.  The first character may be either
               'Z' (for episode one), 'X' (for episode two), or 'Y' (for
               episode three).  The second character specifies the level
               number and must be a key between 'Q' and 'O' on the keyboard,
               where 'Q' means level 1 and 'O' means level 9.

               This debug mode, including the level warp, works in both the
               shareware and registered versions of the game.  However, if you
               try to warp to an episode 2 or 3 level in the shareware version,
               the game will crash.


[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike]

+ Cheat Codes - [J] [A] [M] [Enter] - These keys are to be pressed one at a
                time.  When all are pressed, the message "Now you're
                Jammin'" appears, and you will be given all keys and 100%
                health, but your score will be zeroed out.  This will only
                work on the registered version of the game.

+ Cheat Command Line Parameters - The following command line parameters can
                                  be used in both the shareware and registered
                                  versions of the game:

    POWERBALL - Enables debug keys.  This also requires that you hold down the
                left and right shift keys during the JAM Logo intro.  Don't
                hold them down until the white letters start to appear.
                Once the PC-13 screen is loaded, you can let go.  You will hear
                a "ching" sound during the intro when debug mode has been
                successfully enabled.  The "ching" sound will only happen if
                you have a sound card. If you have a PC speaker, you won't hear
                this.
         TICS - Display TIC INFO in score area.
        MUSIC - Enable music test mode: [backspace] [arrows] changes music.
        RADAR - Displays a rotating overhead view during gameplay.  Please note
                that this REALLY slows the game down, to the point of being
                unplayable.

                These cheat keys can be use during gameplay only if you invoked
                the program with the "powerball" parameter:

       [backspace] W - Warp to level ([shift] [W] loads the default map)
       [backspace] D - Player invisible (dumb objects)
       [backspace] G - God mode
       [backspace] I - Item cheat
       [backspace] M - Memory info
       [backspace] P - Pause screen
       [backspace] Q - Fast quit
       [backspace] A - Add Actors to AutoMapper.
       [backspace] U - Unlock all floors
       [backspace] O - Show hidden walls on auto mapper
       [backspace] E - Quick Win Mission
       [backspace] B - Border color
       [backspace] C - Count objects
       [backspace] F - Facing spot
       [backspace] H - Hurt self (only if not in God mode)
       [backspace] S - Slow motion
       [backspace] V - Extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do
                                   nothing for most users)
  [backspace] [home] - Dec sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgup] - Inc sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
   [backspace] [end] - Dec ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgdn] - Inc ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
       [backspace] + - Add shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] - - Dec shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] ] - Inc shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] [ - Dec shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [shift] [tab] - Show full automap containing all live actors.

     These cheat keys can be used during gameplay:

           [6] [7] - Collect all bonus items (gold, ammo, health, etc).
           [7] [8] - Kill all actors.
           [6] [8] - Collect all bonus items and kill all actors.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters - These aren't really debug codes, or
       cheats, either.  They're in here for Apogee's Tech Support to use in
       assisting customers who might be having problems running the game.

    VERSION - Display version information.
     SYSTEM - Display system information.
 HIDDENCARD - Disable checking for video card.
     NOJOYS - Disable checking for joysticks.
    NOMOUSE - Disable checking for mouse.
     NOMAIN - Disable checking for main memory.
      NOEMS - Disable checking for EMS memory.
      NOXMS - Disable checking for XMS memory.
       NOAL - Disable checking for Adlib.
       NOSB - Disable checking for Sound Blaster.
      NOPRO - Disable checking for Sound Blaster Pro.
       NOSS - Disable checking for Sound Source.
        SST - Disable checking for Tandy Sound Source.
        SS1 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT1.
        SS2 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT2.
        SS3 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT3.
      NO386 - Disable checking for 386.
   ENABLEGP - Enables NoteBook GamePort checking.  (This will do bad things if
                                                    you try it on an Acer.)


[Duke Nukem II]

+ Customer Cheat - For the registered version only, the following two codes
                   can be used during gameplay.  Please note that all three
                   letters have to be pressed at the same time.

  [E] [A] [T] - health is restored to maximum, but score is reset to zero
  [N] [U] [K] - get a random weapon, plus all inventory required to finish
                the current level


[Alien Carnage]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [B] [I] [G] all at the same time will give you
                   full health and jetpack power.

+ Debug Mode - The following debug keys work for version 1.1 of Halloween
               Harry only:

               [ctrl] [R] [E] [N] - Gives you all weapons, and activates
                                    god mode for several seconds.
                        [alt] [L] - Level warp.  Type the number of the
                                    episode (1-4), followed by the number of
                                    the level (1-5).  Illegal input will dump
                                    you to DOS.  This can not be used in the
                                    shareware version to access levels in the
                                    registered version.
                        [alt] [=] - Change location within a level.  Type
                                    coordinates after this code; illegal
                                    input will probably crash the game.

+ Tech Parameters - Pressing these four keys at the same time will show you the
                    coordinates you are at on the level.  This serves no real
                    function on its own, but it is used by Apogee's Game Hint
                    Line sometimes to locate a player in a level.  The keys are
                    [ctrl] [alt] [rshift] [F12]

+ Misc Command Line Parameters - "skip" will start the game directly from the
                                 main menu.


[Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [I] [L] [M] all at the same time, will give you
                   both keys, and will give you 100% health.  It will also
                   take your score to zero.  This cheat will work in both the
                   shareware and the registered version.

+ Debug Mode -

  The debug mode is activated with a different command line parameter
  depending on what version of the game you have.

  v1.0  -> -next
           Once in the game, press [ctrl] [tab] [enter] to activate.

  v1.1+ -> -goobers
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Spear -> -debugmode
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Once activated, these are the keys you can use.

  [tab] [Q] - Quit
  [tab] [W] - Warp to level xx
  [tab] [E] - Exit to next level
  [tab] [T] - Debug info in memory
  [tab] [I] - Free items
  [tab] [O] - Map of level (only works in beta versions of Wolf3D)
  [tab] [S] - Slow motion
  [tab] [F] - Position info
  [tab] [G] - God mode (no damage)
  [tab] [H] - Hurt yourself
  [tab] [X] - Extra stuff (???)
  [tab] [C] - Statistics
  [tab] [V] - Add extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do nothing
                              for most users except maybe increase or decrease
                              the game speed.)
  [tab] [B] - Change border color
  [tab] [M] - Memory map
  [tab] [N] - No clipping (walk through walls)
              (This works only in Wolf3D v1.0 shareware.  This mode can cause
               really bad things to happen to the game, including corrupting
               itself, which is why it was taken out.)

+ Jukebox - Hold down [M] when the game is starting to access a jukebox.  It
            only brings up a few songs at a time; keep on doing this, and
            you'll get a randomly selected list of songs each time.

+ Spear of Destiny only - To get a Gang Screen, choose the window resize
                          option, change the window size, press enter to
                          confirm, then immediately hold down the [I] and [D]
                          keys together.
                        - If you do nothing in the game for 30 seconds, BJ
                          will either cross his eyes or stick his tongue out
                          at you.  It happens quickly, so you have to watch
                          carefully.  You can repeat this as many times as
                          you like.
                        - God mode is accessible in Spear without the use of
                          the -debugmode command line parameter.  Simply hold
                          [tab] [G] [F10] down together to toggle it.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters are the same as in Blake Stone, except
  VERSION, SYSTEM, and ENABLEGP do nothing in Wolf3D.

+ Misc Command Line Parameters - "NOWAIT" will start the game directly from
                                 the main menu.

+ Note:  If you press [B] [A] [T] all at once, you'll get a message asking
         why you're trying to cheat, since this is the old Keen Galaxy cheat
         code.


[Bio Menace]

+ Cheat Codes - In the registered version only, press the following keys at the
                same time to activate the cheat.

  [C] [A] [T] - Get the machine gun, 99 ammo, and 99 grenades.

+ Secret Weapons - The following secret weapons are available in both the
                   shareware and registered versions of the games.

    Super Plasma Bolt - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit fire; this causes one hit point of damage.
      Fireball Attack - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit fire.
      Electron Shield - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit the jump key.
  Invincibility Burst - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit the down arrow.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters -

            COMP - Turn on SVGA compatibility
            NOAL - Disable Adlib sound card detection
          NOJOYS - Disable joystick detection
         NOMOUSE - Disable mouse detection
      HIDDENCARD - Disable video card detection


[Monster Bash]

+ Cheat Codes - In the registered version only, you can press the [Z] and
                [F10] keys down simultaneously to receive five lives.  Hold
                down [Z] first; since the [F10] key, by itself, has meaning
                in the game, the cheat won't work if you push both down at
                the same time and the [F10] is the first to register.


[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter]

+ Cheat Codes - Pressing the [B] [A] [T] keys all at once will give you 99
                shots, an extra life, and all the gems.  This does not work
                on early versions of Aliens Ate My Babysitter.

+ Debug Codes - Pressing [A] [2] [enter] all at once will activate debug mode.
                (Early versions of the game do not require this step.)
                Once activated, these keys will perform the following
                functions:

    [F10] [G] - God mode.
    [F10] [I] - Free items.
    [F10] [J] - Jump cheat.
    [F10] [N] - No clipping.  (Be careful.  Falling off the bottom of the level
                               will kill you even in God mode.)
    [F10] [Y] - View hidden areas in the level.
    [F10] [B] - Set border color (1-15).
    [F10] [C] - Show number of active/inactive objects in the level.
    [F10] [D] - Record a demo.
    [F10] [E] - End the current level.
    [F10] [M] - Display memory usage.
    [F10] [S] - Slow motion.
    [F10] [T] - Sprite test.
    [F10] [V] - Add 0-8 VBLs.  (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do
                                 nothing for most users)
    [F10] [W] - Warp to any level.
    [F10] [Y] - Reveal hidden areas.


[Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons]

+ Cheat Codes - Either of these cheats will work with either the shareware
                or registered versions of the game.  The key combinations
                need to be pressed at the same time.

               [C] [T] [space] - Gives pogostick, all keycards, and full ammo.
                 [shift] [tab] - Pass through an unplayed level on world map.
                   [G] [O] [D] - God mode, plus jump cheat (jumping causes you
                                 to fly).


[Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure]

+ Cheat Codes - Pressing [C] [0] [F10] down simultaneously will give you
                a full health and bombs.  This cheat only works once per game.

+ Debug Codes - Pressing [tab] [del] [F12] at once activates debug mode.
                The debug keys are:

    [F10] [G] - God mode.
    [F10] [W] - Warp.
    [F10] [M] - Display memory usage statistics.

+ Command Line Parameters - Give "apogee" on the command line when starting
                            up Cosmo.  The effects of this are many.  One,
                            the game will not recognize your old high
                            scores or saved games.  (The high scores will
                            be reset to those of Simpsons' characters until
                            you exit and re-enter the program normally.)
                            In this mode, if you die quickly enough after
                            entering a level, you'll be invincible from then
                            on, to everything but pits on the bottom of
                            each level.


[Duke Nukem]

+ Cheat Codes - Pressing [backspace] [pgdn] at the same time will give you
                all keys and full gun power.  This can be used in either
                the shareware or registered version of the game.

+ Debug Codes - To activate, start up the game with "asp" as a command line
                parameter.  (It must be in lower case.)  Once activated, you
                can press the following key combinations inside the game.
                All keys in each combination must be pressed simultaneously.

  [G] [O] [D] - Get full health and all items.
  [G] [O] [W] - Advance to the next level.


[Major Stryker]

+ Customer Cheat - The cheats here are a bit more complicated than in other
                   games.  There is a two step procedure to active the cheat
                   mode.  (This cheat mode only works in the registered
                   version.  It does nothing in the shareware version.)

          Step 1 - Type [C] [H] [E] [A] [T] at the Main Title Screen.
                   All keys need to be pressed one at a time.  When
                   you get it, you'll see the message that says
                   "Cheat Active" (it really isn't yet).
          Step 2 - During the game, hold down the [backspace] key,
                   and then press the [H] & [S] keys at the same

[6.2.2]  Hex editing

Editing saved game files is one of the finer methods of cheating.  Below are
the specs for the saved game files for some Apogee games.  To make use of
these specs, you'll need a hex editor (an editor, as opposed to a text
editor, which allows you to directly edit a binary file), and a small dose
of know-how.  If you are not comfortable with computers in general, it is
not recommended that you attempt to cheat in this manner; mistakes editing
these saved game files may cause unpredictable results.  Naturally, neither
Apogee nor I take responsibility for any damage caused by manually editing
saved game files.


[Wacky Wheels]

You can edit the WACKY.CFG file to change a number of different things:

      872H - number of laps, in longints (back up three and use those four
             bytes; remember that longints, integers, and words have
             reversed bytes).
      876H - Difficulty level (1=amateur, 2=pro, 3=champ).
      882H - Your points.
      886H - Opponent's points.
      88AH - Opponent's points.
      88EH - Opponent's points.
      892H - Opponent's points.
      896H - Opponent's points.
      89AH - Opponent's points.
      89EH - Opponent's points.
      87AH - Course group (bronze, silver, etc).
      87EH - Course number (1-5).
      8C3H - Number of porcupines.
      957H - Horsepower of your engine (1=12HP, 2=6HP).

      Changing your character type is slightly more complicated.  First,
      edit location 86AH as follows, remembering your old character number.
             0=Uno,   1=Sultan, 2=Morris, 3=Peggles,
             4=Razer, 5=Ringo,  6=Blombo, 7=Tigi
      At location 8A2H should be the number of your old character.
      Somewhere between 8A6H and 8BEH should be your new character number.
      Switch those bytes, so the one with the new character number has the
      old one in it, and your character number has the new number in it.

Note that changing the course group in the shareware version will not permit
access to the registered version course groups, but will instead crash the
game.


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

With a hex editor, change bytes 27h and 28h of a Raptor saved game file
(char????.fil) to the value FF.  When you load this saved game, you'll have
a few million dollars to spend on equipment.  If you don't have a hex editor,
there are some programs available that do this for you.  The most common
is RapCheat, available in various game cheat archives.

[6.3]  Hints

The following contains some of the most frequently needed hints to various
Apogee games.  In the interest of keeping this FAQ from growing much more than
it already has, it is limited to those hints and clues Apogee is asked for the
most.  This section contains spoilers -- use with caution.

}[Stargunner]
}
}A feature of Stargunner that gamers frequently overlook is that games may
}be saved mid-level.  You may hit [F2] at any time to save your game.
}Mid-level saved games are not uncommon in Apogee games, but, it is
}occasionally missed in Stargunner because the feature is not heavily
}advertised within the game, and Stargunner's precedessor, Raptor, did not
}have this feature.  Nevertheless, saving mid-level is often essential for
}solving Stargunner, as the game can be very difficult even on the easiest
}difficulty setting.
}
}It is also worth noting that, since Stargunner keeps track of each individual
}player that uses the game, it is able to provide eight saved games slots
}*per player*.  And, since you are not given unlimited lives as with many
}other Apogee games and must converse lives whenever possible, it is
}highly recommended that you make use of each and every one of those eight
}saved game slots instead of overwriting the previous saved game each time.
}This way, if you ever get cornered in a spot where you absolutely cannot
}proceed without more lives than you have, you can backtrack as far back as
}necessary and try to do better.
}
}[Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition]
}
}A particularly difficult part of "Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition" is finding
}the red keycard in Episode 4, Level 4 ("Babe Land").  The red keycard can
}be found from the shooting gallery.  You must shoot the second and fourth
}circular targets -- this will open a space behind the stuffed prizes.  Shoot
}the toys and drop inside, and you'll find the keycard.

[Commander Keen:  Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter]

The following procedures tell you how to get to the secret levels in episodes
4-6 of the Commander Keen series.  The text was adapted from a procedure
written by Joe Siegler.

Episode 4:  To get to the Pyramid of the Forbidden (the hidden pyramid with
the hand on it), go to the Pyramid of the Moons level, get the yellow crystal
and go to the room that has twelve inchworms in it.  To the left is an open
passageway with some inchworms to the left of it.  All the way to the right of
this bottom room is a door that needs the yellow crystal.  Go through the door
and flip the switch behind it.  The left trapdoor will close over allowing all
the inchworms to gather.

Get the twelve inchworms together in one spot.  When you are near them, they
will follow you; if they are off-screen, they'll lose track of you.  When
the twelve are gathered together, a foot will form above your head.  Jump on
the foot, and it will take you to the hidden pyramid.

While you're in the hidden pyramid, you won't be allowed to play any other
levels until you finish that one.  When the hidden pyramid level is completed,
the foot will be there again.  Jump on it, and you'll be transported to the
outside of the Pyramid of the Moons, and you can continue with your game.
I'll also mention that while you're in the hidden pyramid, you won't
be allowed to play any other levels until you finish that one.  When
you finish the hidden pyramid, the foot will be there again.  Jump on
it, and you'll be transported to the outside of the Pyramid of the
Moons again, and you can continue with your game.

To get outside the Pyramid of the Moons, you need to go all the way to
the left of the room where the inchworms are.  There will be four guns
in the ceiling shooting down.  To the left of them is a hole in the
ceiling you can jump into.  Do that, and there will be a pole in there (that
you can't see) that you can grab onto.  Save your game, since it's easy
to die in here.  Follow the passageway and you'll see a door.  You can
go into that door if you want; there's a free life.  Come back through
and jump into the ceiling above that door, and follow a passageway in
the wall.  You'll come out to a doorway with a bunch of ice cream
cones in front of it.  Go through that door, and you're outside the
pyramid.

However, if you exit this level before going to the hidden pyramid,
you won't be able to get to the hidden pyramid, since this level
(Pyramid of the Moons) will be considered finished, and you won't be
able to get back in.

Episode 5:  Stand in the archway near the end of the level in the "Gravitional
Dampening Hub".  You will not be able to see yourself in there.  You'll need
to do the down jump maneuver, which is holding the down arrow and pressing
jump.  You will fall into the floor below you.  You will then need to walk to
the left, as far as you can go.  Since you will not be able to see yourself,
the only way to know it's working is if the screen starts moving.  If, when
you start moving left, you appear again next to the arch, you didn't do the
down jump maneuver right.

Once you walk to the leftmost part of the level, you'll fall all the way to
the bottom of the level.  Once you stop falling, walk to the right, and you'll
appear again.  SAVE YOUR GAME HERE!   The passageway that you're in leads to
a teleporter, which will take you to the secret level.  There are no more
secrets along the way here, but there is a LOT of stuff that will kill you --
precisely the reason you should have saved your game beforehand.

Also, there is a bug in the secret level of Keen 5.  Once you get there, if
you look around hard enough, you'll find a transistor that you're supposed to
pogo on and break.  Sometimes you'll not be able to break it.  Apogee never
found why this happens.  Sometimes it will work; sometimes it won't.  If you
do break it, the end game story will say that the Shikadi ship blew up;
otherwise, it will say that it got away.

Episode 6:  This is the easiest one of them all.  Right before the final level
of the game, when you're on the world map, you'll see a somewhat large blue
towering thing that looks like a cross between a hut and a mouth.  If you look
beyond it, you'll see a yellow fence.  If you walk through the mouth and out
the other side, you'll come to the fence (don't enter the level; going in the
mouth and pressing space will put you into the level).  Stay on the world map,
and wait there a minute or two.  A spaceship will come around, pick you up,
and will take you to the secret level.  When you're done with the secret
level, wait for the ship again, and it will take you back.  An English
translation of the Galactic Alphabet is in a hidden area in this level.

[Paganitzu]

The solutions to two of the hardest Paganitzu levels, 1-12 and 1-19, follow.
The original draft of the text was written by Joe Siegler.

Paganitzu Episode 1 - level 12:

12   + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     k -- key

     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P

You begin at the point P-11.  First, we'll concentrate on clearing the left
side of the map and getting the 4 keys.  Remove the rubble at K-11, then go
to B-9.  Push the rock at B-8 up one space, then push the rock at D-8 up
one space.  Then move to D-8 and push the rock at C-8 to the left.  The
left side of the map should now look like this:

1    + + + + +
2    = & & & &
3    + k k k +
4    +       +

11   +   #
12   + + + + +

     A B C D E

Get the key at C-7, then repeat the same steps for the next set of 3
boulders (i.e. push the rocks at B-5 and D-5 up one space, then push the
rock at C-5 to the left and get the keys.

Notice how this leaves you with 2 usable rocks, now located at D-7 and D-4.
We'll come back to them; now it's time for the right side of the screen.

Prepare by pushing the rock at I-10 up one space, then release the spider
by clearing the rubble at F-11.  Keep out of his way, and as soon as
possible, go stand at H-9, directly to the left of the rock you just pushed
up.  When the spider begins going down the "corridor" of L,M,N,O-9, follow
him with the rock.  Here's what the right side of the screen should look
like:

1   + + + + + + + + +
2   & & & & & & & & +
3   + + + + + D D D !
4   + + k   + D k D +
5   S S     + D D D +
6           +       +       where you are "@" at H-9, pushing the rock at
7           + R * R +       I-9 to the right as the spider goes down the
8         S + * * * +       "corridor" from L-9 to O-9

11        R         (
12  + + + + + + + + +

    H I J K L M N O P

When you trap the spider at O-9 with the rock, he will explode, turning
himself, the rock at O-8, and the rock you were pushing at N-9 into
diamonds.  Move into the area, and get the diamonds and key.  Notice now
that you have 3 usable rocks available to you, at M-8, N-8, and N-7.

You now have enough rocks to proceed.  Use the 4 rocks from the right side
of the screen, (if you mess anything up, you've got two extra rocks on the
left side) to block the snakes, get the final keys, and exit the level.

Throughout this message, I'll refer to a trick I'll call "the technique"
which is essentially, pushing a rock from below or from its right side up
to the coordinates I-4, moving yourself to H-4, then pushing the rock to
the right, then down.  "The technique" is useful for getting rocks in a
position where you can push them from its left side.  But more about that
later.  Here we go.

First, avoiding the spider, push the rock at E-6 up one space, then push
the rock at D-8 up and to the right one space (so it ends up at E-7).  Keep
out of the spiders way until he enters the small "nook" area you created at
E-6 - when he does that, push the rock at C-6 in behind him.  The spider,
trapped by the rocks and the pipeline, will explode, turning the rocks and
the pipe into diamonds and opening a passage to the right side of the
screen.

Next, on the right side of the screen, push the rock at I-9 to the left
against the wall, then push the rock at I-8 up to I-4.  Now use "the
technique" to get that rock down to J-7.  So far so good?

Push the rock at J-7 to K-7, so it will be a few spaces directly above
the spears.  Now comes a semi-tricky part.  You must run and push the
rock that is at L-8 to M-8.  If you do it right, the spears will shoot up
and miss you, hitting the rock you left at K-7 earlier.  Now you should be
at L-8, and the rock that was formerly there should be at M-8. (Make sure
didn't push the rock too far -- if it ended up at N-8 or O-8 instead of
M-8, you'll have to start over!)

Now, go down and dissolve the wall at M-11 (just run into it) and get the
key at L-11 (the snake can't attack since the discharged spears are in his
way.  Now, push the rock at M-10 to N-10, then push it up into the water at
N-6.  Next, push the rock at M-8 to N-8, push the rock at M-9 down to M-10
to get it out of your way, then push the rock at N-8 up into the water at
N-5, and push the rock at M-10 up into the water at M-6.

Now you'll need to use the rock at K-7 which the spears hit earlier.  Don't
worry; the spears won't come up any further after you move the rock.
Standing to the right of the rock at K-7, use "the technique" to move the
rock over and up to I-4, over to J-4, then back down to J-7.  Push the rock
over to M-7, then up into the water at M-5.  Finally, push the rock at L-9
up to L-7, then use "the technique" to manipulate it like the others, until
you can push it (from its left side) over to N-7; then push it up to N-4 to
block the snake.

After that, the rest is easy.  Walk up through the gap at M-6 and M-5, grab
the key, head back down, grab the key at O-7 and turn and run QUICKLY before
the spikes hit you (it can be done!), then head for the exit!

[6.4]  Secrets and Other Fun Things

Frequently, game programmers will embed little fun things into their games.
Usually, these things would not crop up under ordinary game play.  Sometimes
it requires doing certain things, typing certain codes, or even activating
the program on a particular day or time.  Sometimes these little things are
called "easter eggs."  Below are some such things that can be found in some
of Apogee's games, and the instructions for getting to them.

      From Apogee:

[XenoPhage]

In the registered version, type "xacman" at the menu screen to play a subgame
similar to Pac-Man.

}Also in the registered version, you can fight the secret boss Blarney by
}typing "blarney" at any menu screen.

Other tricks can be done with the XPR.INI file:  change BloodVolume to 499998
to get more blood than even the BLOOD cheat code.  Change "Type" in both the
FPPlayer1 and FPPlayer2 sections to "2" (the joystick) to get your opponent to
mirror your punches and kicks (but not movement).

[Rise of the Triad]

If you start ROTT when your system clock indicates that it's one of five
different holidays, the "group picture" of the five main characters is
changed slightly.  In addition, on Christmas, the music for the first
level is changed to a familiar Christmas tune.  The holidays and effects
are as follows:

   Easter             <varies>    Lorelei Ni wears Easter Bunny ears.
   Cinco de Mayo       05/05      Ian wears a sombrero.
   Independence Day    07/04      Doug holds an American flag.
   Halloween           10/31      Thi wears a witch's hat.
   Christmas           12/24      Taradino wears a Santa Claus hat; new music
                       12/25      for the first level.

Also, there's a way to get all five "holiday hats" in Rise of the Triad to
show up on the screen at the same time.  If you finish the game the right way,
and destroy all the larvae in the last level, watch ALL the credits (takes
several minutes).  You'll get to a screen that says "The HUNT is victorious.
The End."  Do nothing.  Let it sit there for about a minute or two, and
you'll get another "The End" screen where all five "holiday hats" are shown
at once.

A second amusing way to start Rise of the Triad is to supply "DOPEFISH" as a
command line parameter ("ROTT DOPEFISH").  This causes Scott Miller's mystical
head to appear on the main screen.  Lee Jackson's musical composition "Fish
Polka" will play.  Joe Siegler will burp.  Tom Hall will say "O," "K," or
"Boy" as you move around the menu.  And the names of the levels will be a
little sillier than usual.

In the secret level "Eight Ways To Hell" (episode 3, area 8), designed by
Joe Siegler (a noted and revered Dopefish follower), there's a hidden area
about half way through the level.  It's a long, narrow hallway with
boulders running down the middle and elasto-modes on the sides.  There's
a touchplate at the beginning of the hallway which, when triggered, will
open up a secret room.  The gray walls in the middle of the secret room
spell a message written in the Commander Keen language (see the Keen
secrets section, below).  Look at all the gray walls from all angles, or
use the \MAP cheat (see the cheats section).  Then look at the map to see
the letters.  Translated, it says, "Dopefish Lives!"

Bosses play big roles in Rise of the Triad.  There are four, one at the end
of each episode, and arranged in order of weakest to strongest.  There are
ways to kill two of the bosses that the programmers at Apogee never thought
to try.  These "loopholes" are "fixed" in version 1.3 of ROTT, but version 1.2a
and previous versions still have the loopholes.  For Sebastian "Doyle"
Krist, you can lure him out of the room by hitting the touch plate diagonally
away and to the right of the gold door as you enter it.  The triggering the
touchplate will block the gold door and open a passageway.  Lure Krist
through here carefully, then through the brown door.  Then go up the
staircase!  Krist, in his wheelchair will follow you up.  However, due to
a bug in Krist's programming (he was never intended to ascend stairs), he
won't fall back down to the ground.  He'll fire missiles at you, but if you're
safely beneath him, they won't hit you.  Shoot him until he's dead.  You can
also lure the NME out of the room he starts in, but if he's led into the
nearby spinblades, the game will crash (this bug, by the way, was *not* fixed
in ROTT version 1.3, so be careful).

The second loophole involves the final boss, El Oscuro, in his final form
(the snake-like form).  Get a firebomb and an asbestos vest.  Then find
El Oscuro and lure him into a corner.  Keep the corner at your back.  Aim
the firebomb down and fire it -- this will thrust you up into the air.
Land on El Oscuro and wait for him to exhaust himself.  (The intended method
of killing him is to not fire at him at all, but dodge his own attacks until
he dies of exhaustion.  In all his forms, firing at him simply makes him
stronger!  Note, however, that El Oscuro can be hurt by the firepits, so
luring him over those is another technique for doing him in.

It's hard to see, but there's a license plate on the back of the NME (the boss
monster for episode 3 of the registered version).  It looks like a Texas
license plate that says "Spray."  (Spray is the NME's nickname, given by the
ROTT developement team.)  You can see this graphic at the Apogee web page;
specifically, at http://www.apogee1.com/catalog/rott/.

Several people have run across the curious message "I'm Free" while playing
ROTT, and don't know what it means.  If you get this, you're probably playing
either the "This Causes An Error" level in the registered version, or you're
playing a user-made level.  The cause of the note is whenever a moving wall
crosses the boundary of a level and just keeps on going.  The game detects the
problem, but, before crashing with a regular error message, manages to put up
the picture saying, "I'm Free" (drawn by Tom Hall).  The "This Causes An
Error" level, originally titled "WanderWall Bug Map," has a pushwall in it
that leaves the level, crashing the game with the "I'm Free" message.
In the rejected ROTT levels (ROTT_REJ.ZIP), there is a level called "This
Causes An Error Too."

What all this is, is a manifestation of in-house humor.  If you don't get it,
that's good, because you're not supposed to.  It's one of those "you had to
be there" things.  At any rate, the story goes...during the development of
ROTT, when a level was tested wherein a pushwall was inadvertantly directed
out of the level bounds, Joe Selinske, former member of Apogee, joked, saying,
"I'm free."  He probably wishes he hadn't, for all the confusion it's caused
customers who have run across it -- either that, or, if he were more like me,
he feels a deep sense of satisfaction in having successfully dumbfounded a
significant enough percentage of the gaming community to warrant mention in
FAQs such as these.

Joe Selinske's response to the above paragraph is quoted below:

Yes, you are right.  I do get deep satisfaction and a lot of laughs thinking
back to when that whole "I'm Free" gag was running around Apogee.  I am the
bastard who started it, Tom [Hall] drew it, Joe [Siegler] scanned it in and
Mark [Dochtermann] put it in the game.  There were so many things going on
during ROTT development that it scares me to think about them.  Wow, that
was some fun.  But way too many inside jokes if you ask me.  ;)

[Wacky Wheels]

To see the Dopefish, a creature from Commander Keen, start any single player
race.  When everybody else moves, stand still.  Hold down the break, and turn
left all the way around until the Dopefish shows up.  Note:  the lion that
starts the race must remain on the screen the entire time; otherwise, the
Dopefish won't appear.  You can do this as many times as you like, so long
as the lion doesn't leave the screen.

Also, in the shareware version of the game, there are two ways to play the
track shown in the ordering information of the shareware game, which is
supposed to be a track available only in the registered version.  One way
is to play in Championship Mode; you will play that track as a bonus.  The
sneakier way is to exploit a loophole.  Start a new game, and complete
track 1.  Save the game, and quit to the main menu.  Now look at the ordering
information.  Go back to the main menu, restore the saved game, and voila.

[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

Raptor was written by Cygnus, and it seems to be a birthday present to
themselves.  Whenever Raptor is started when your system's clock matches the
birthday of one of the people at Cygnus, Raptor behaves a little strangely.
Here's the list of recognized birthdays.  You can reset your system clock
to one of these dates manually, if you wish; any year should be all right,
so long as it's not in the past:

                       March 12        Bobby Prince
                       May 16          Scott Host
                       August 28       Rich Fleider
                       October 2       Jim Molinets

Note that in v1.0 of Raptor, Bobby Prince's birthday was not recognized,
while Tim Neveu's was.

What happens is this:  first, the Apogee logo is displayed, but not with
Apogee's trademark music.  Instead, you hear the Cygnus folks, sounding a
little tipsy, humming the Apogee theme music themselves.  In version 1.1 and
1.2, Bobby Prince says, "You boys just don't get it, do ya?" immediately
afterward.  In addition, some of the Raptor levels contain enemies that don't
normally appear such as monkeys who throw coconuts at you, raptor dinosaurs
scurrying across the screen, and cows with machine guns concealed beneath
their hides.  Most of these peculiar enemies appear on the first mission of
the game, and they are usually difficult to kill.

Finally, when you exit the game, you get to hear the member of Cygnus whose
birthday it is give an impersonation of a monkey.  This might consist of
hooting or screeching sounds, or simply an eloquent rendering of the word
"monkey."  (The raucous you hear when monkeys appear during the game are
all the monkey impersonations playing together at random.)

There is a way, beyond setting the system time to a particular birthday, of
getting the monkeys and raptors and cows to fight you.  When the screen comes
up where you must choose a sector to fly, flip the switch at the bottom center
of the screen by clicking on it with the mouse.  It should darken.  This
activates the three lights to the right of this switch.  In version 1.0 of
Raptor, you should turn on the first and third lights; in v1.1 and v1.2 of
Raptor, you should turn all three lights on.  Then you can select a sector or
"auto pilot" and fly the level.  You'll know the cheat worked if you hear a
static-like sound.  All levels have some new enemy that appears by using this
cheat, though sometimes they are small and inconspicuous.  Besides monkeys,
cows, and raptors, there are:  the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship
from Space 1999, pedestrians, a woman sunbathing on a roof, and other
miscellaneous items.

Note, however, that if you activate the "battle cow" mode using the switches,
as opposed to running the game on a Cygnus birthday, you don't get the goofy
Apogee theme song in the beginning, nor the individual monkey impersonation
at the end.

[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!]

In Keen: Galaxy, episode 4, go to the level entitled "Pyramid of the Moons,"
and from there, to the half moons painted on the floor.  If you stand on
these and do nothing for a while, Keen will moon you, instead of his usual
idle activity of reading a book.  This will only happen once per game,
however.

Also, in all episodes of Commander Keen, signs are written in an alien
language.  The comment is made, "too bad you don't know the language."  Well,
now you do.  The language is a simple symbol substitution, the key of which
is given below.  This key appears only twice in all the Keen games; in the
secret areas of the secret levels of episodes three and six.

  A     B     C     D     E     F     G     H     I     J     K     L     M

      From 3D Realms:

[Terminal Velocity]

When you start a new game in the registered CD version, you can get to the
hidden planet by entering "Terminal" as your name and "Reality" as your
call sign.  (Both of these are case sensitive.)  Before you start playing
the hidden planet, a message appears saying you are flying the TV-302, a
new, experimental ship.  As far as gameplay is concerned, no, you're not
flying a new ship; this is simply an element of the game's storyline.
The hidden planet is not in the shareware version or the disk based
registered version.

Also, in level 3-1 of Terminal Velocity, fly close to the ground near the
coordinates (63,227).  You will see a photographic image of the Terminal
Reality team.  If you fly too high, the fog will obstruct the view.  A
clearer version of this can be found as a GIF file on the Terminal
Velocity CD in the PREVIEW directory.

[6.5]  Troubleshooting

[6.5.1]  Things to try first

If you have a program with an Apogee game not starting correctly, there are a
few things you can try.  First, make sure your system meets the hardware
requirements of the game.  If they don't, you probably can't run the game
without upgrading your hardware.

Second, make sure you have the most recent version of the game.  Many older
versions of games have bugs that are fixed in the most recent versions.

Third, if there is a XXXXHELP.EXE file that came with the game, read it.
(Most registered Apogee games have such a file on the first game disk;
with shareware versions, you might find it there and possibly in the directory
the game was installed to as well.)  This file will contain numerous common
technical problems with their solutions.

Fourth, check the Apogee web site.  Common technical support questions and
their answers are posted there (direct URL:  http://www.apogee1.com/tech/) in
addition to the contents of the XXXXHELP.EXE files for many games.

If you're running under Windows 95, that may be the problem.  Check the Apogee
web site for information on booting to DOS when Windows 95 is installed on
your system (direct URL:  http://www.apogee1.com/tech/multiboot.html).  While
several Apogee games do run under Windows 95, some don't, and none are
guaranteed to do so.

If the game is failing to start due to insufficient memory, you can try
removing TSRs, or booting "clean."  With MS-DOS 6.0 or greater, you can do
this by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the system is booting.
This causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be bypassed.  If you
are running a memory manager, try removing the manager altogether; this
seems to fix most problems Apogee games have with EMS/XMS memory.  Additional
suggestions on how to free up memory may be in the XXXXHELP.EXE file.

Also, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some
games, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the
game.  Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.

If you problem is your Soundblaster card (or a Soundblaster emulating card),
then the problem may be the settings on the card or the BLASTER environment
variable.  Check the section on that subject below.

With regard to drive compression, Apogee has tested their entire product
line with Stacker 3.1, Stacker 4.0, and MS-DOS 6.22's DriveSpace.  The
products all worked fine, with the following exceptions:   Monster Bash
suffered a slowdown using DriveSpace.  The install procedure for the Rise
of the Triad CD version 1.2a does not work under any drive compression
program, but the game may be installed manually and will run fine.

If you've tried everything and still can't get an Apogee game to work
correctly, contact Apogee's technical support services.  These are listed
under "Contacting Apogee."

[6.5.2]  Setting the BLASTER environment variable

This section may be useful if you are having problems with sound or music in
an Apogee game.
 
Apogee games that use Sound Blasters look at the BLASTER environment variable
to figure out where to send its sound output.  Check to make sure that you
have the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This code is an example,
and probably isn't exactly what you need to put in your system.
 
NOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of
      cards.  For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE 32.  The
      minimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters.  The other
      three may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.
      Please read this entire section to see if you need any of them.  If you
      are using a clone card, or some card that's not a "true" Sound Blaster,
      then you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3 P330 H6 E620
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |_______ AWE 32 Only Parameter
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |__________ "High" DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |_______________ MIDI Port
 |    |     |    |  |  |__________________ Type of Card
 |    |     |    |  |_____________________ DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |________________________ Interrupt
 |    |     |_____________________________ Port Address
 |    |___________________________________ Environment Variable
 |________________________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).
If you have a space in there, your system will read the parameter incorrectly,
and it will not be recognized by our games.

Now, these may not (most likely not) be the same for your board, because the
Port Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by adjusting "jumpers" on
your sound board.  Some newer cards have this information controlled by
software, please consult your card's manual for more information on how to set
these things.  You should also check your manual if you are unclear as to how
to tell what settings your card is set at.  The information *IS* important, so
it's recommended that you know precisely what the settings are.  If you are
using a card that "emulates" the Sound Blaster (such as the Gravis UltraSound
through software, or the PAS16), you should check your card's manual on how to
set the card for Sound Blaster emulation.

For PORT ADDRESS, it's almost always 220.  That seems to be the default for
most sound cards out there, and unless you know you've switched it away from
220, it's a safe bet it's still there.

The INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system.  Mystic Towers
and games prior to Raptor require that your IRQ be set at 7 or less.  Apogee
does not recommend using IRQ2, as it causes problems.

The DMA CHANNEL sometimes causes problems if it isn't set to 1, which is the
usual default.  If it is not set to one, some Apogee games may lock up.

The TYPE OF CARD should be 1 if you have an older Sound Blaster, or a Sound
Blaster emulating card.  Use 3 if you have a newer plain Sound Blaster.  Use
2 for an older Sound Blaster Pro.  Use 4 for a newer Sound Blaster Pro.

The MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has
MIDI capabilites.  If so, this is where you define what MIDI port you are
using.  330 seems to be the default, so if you have a MIDI card, and you
haven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably where it still
is.

The HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Sound Blaster 16
cards.  This is not the same as the standard DMA channel, this is a different
one.  This is only used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing
16 bit Sound Blaster sounds.  By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know
that it's something else, it's probably still 5.

The E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative
Labs AWE 32 sound card.  If you have one of these, this parameter will have
been set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the
card.  Check your AWE 32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what
this parameter is used for.

[6.5.3]  Slowing down your computer to play old games

A great deal of old games do not take the speed of the computer they are
running on into account.  Hence, when an older game runs on a fast computer,
it either crashes with a runtime error, or it runs so fast that it's difficult
or impossible to play.  Either way, this can be fixed by temporarily slowing
down your computer to a speed where the game will function properly.  A
simple program can be used to do this.  Apogee recommends "Mo'Slo," which is
a freeware program available at, among other places, the Apogee FTP site,
under the filename MOSLO12.ZIP.  (However, "Mo'Slo" is not made nor supported
by Apogee.)

Some of Apogee's earliest games will require the use of this program on fast
computers.  These include "Math Rescue," "Word Rescue," "Dark Ages,"
"Monuments of Mars," "Arctic Adventure," "Pharaoh's Tomb," and "The Kroz
Series."
