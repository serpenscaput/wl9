Subject: Apogee FAQ v6.0 (Yes, a new version!)

Some of you may be surprised -- a couple of you I even told I wouldn't be
continuing maintenance of the Apogee FAQ.  But I changed my mind, deciding
instead to take on the large task of revitalizing the FAQ, which had long been
outdated, instilling it with the wealth of information about Apogee that's
transpired in the last fifteen months.  At last, I've completed this major
renovation.  There are additions and/or changes to more sections than not --
almost every last one was touched in some manner.

The most noteworthy change of all is that this FAQ now INCORPORATES every
last bit of information that used to be in the "3D Realms FAQ."  The 3D Realms
FAQ is now obsolete; with the Apogee FAQ v6.0, there is no reason to have it,
and those of you who manage bulletin boards or web sites and had kept the
Apogee and 3D Realms FAQs on them are encouraged to remove the 3D Realms FAQ
from your sites, replacing both with this single document.

I put my heart in to this version, and I'm particularly fond of it.  I hope
you all find it informative and entertaining.

[1.4]  What Is Apogee?

Apogee is a games distributor for PC games of many sorts.  It is a diverse
gaming company, contributing to several different genres of games.  While
much of what Apogee publishes are games written primarily by other companies,
such as Cygnus or Argo Games, Apogee writes their own games as well.  Apogee's
staff includes an array of talented programmers, artists, and musicians.  For
many years now, Apogee has been among the leading shareware games companies
for the PC and compatible market.

}In June of 1994, Apogee announced a new spin-off company called 3D Realms,
}which would only produce 3D action games.  At that time, the 3D games Apogee
}had in development -- "Duke Nukem 3D," "Shadow Warrior," "Blood," and "Ruins:
}Return of the Gods" -- became 3D Realms games instead of Apogee games.
}(Since then, the rights to "Blood" were sold to Monolith Productions, and
}"Ruins: Return of the Gods" was sold to Playmates Interactive Entertainment
}who changed the title to "PowerSlave.")
}
}Later, on February 4, 1997, a third company was announced: Pinball Wizards.
}As its predecessor, 3D Realms, specializes in state of the art 3D action
}games, Pinball Wizards will specialize in state of the art pinball games.
}The pinball game Apogee previously had under production, "Balls of Steel,"
}moved to the Pinball Wizards division.
}
}It is Apogee's intention for most if not all of its future games to be
}funneled through specialized divisions such as 3D Realms and Pinball Wizards.
}The goals of each brand is to produce the best games in their respective
}genres.
}
}This FAQ covers not only Apogee and its games but also all of Apogee's
}specialized divisions and their games.

[1.5]  What Does "Apogee" Mean?

According to the American Heritage dictionary, "apogee" means:  "the point
in the orbit of the moon or of an artificial satellite most distant from
the earth."  Or, more generally, "the farthest or highest point; apex."
Related words are the Greek "apogaion," the neuter form of "apogaios"
which means "away from the earth."  There is also the New Latin word
"apogaeum," which is derived from the Greek word.  There is a French word
"Apogee" (with an accent over the first 'e').  In English, there is the
related word "apogean" and the antonym "perigee."

Interestingly, the meaning of the word "apogee" was one of the questions in
the shareware version of an early Apogee quiz game (discontinued since)
entitled "Word Whiz."

All this is academic, however, for according to an Apogee slogan, "Apogee
means action."  :-)

[1.6]  How Apogee Markets Its Games

In 1987, Apogee came up with a unique method of marketing their games.  Since
then, other shareware companies have adopted their strategy.  Their scheme is
this:  each game they produce is divided into three to four, sometimes even
six episodes.  The first episode is free.  It can be downloaded from
CompuServe, BBS's, or the Internet, or bought in a store that distributes
shareware games for disk copying charges.  You can distribute the shareware
episode to your friends yourself, if you like, provided you leave all the
original files intact.

}Starting in June 1994, Apogee began the creation of specialized brands for its
}games.  The company 3D Realms was created for Apogee's 3D action games.  In
}February 1997, the Pinball Wizards division was born for its pinball games.
}In the future, few if any of Apogee's games will be released under its own
}name but rather under one of its specialized brands.

If you like the shareware episode of an Apogee game, Apogee requires that you
register it.  This is the normal rule regarding shareware.  Upon registration,
you will receive the complete game.  Apogee uses this marketing scheme so that
people can have a good idea about the game they are buying before they put
their cash on the line.

}Starting with Death Rally, the registered versions of most Apogee games are
}published simultaneously in retail by GT Interactive.  So, if you'd rather not
}order Apogee games by mail, you can pick them up at your local software store.

[1.7]  Getting the Latest Information

There are a few ways to get the latest information about Apogee, even if you
want it more quickly than keeping up with the latest revisions of this FAQ
would do.  These methods are mentioned briefly in the following sections.

[1.7.1]  Electronic news

On Usenet, the newsgroups alt.games.apogee, comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action,
and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc all carry discussion about Apogee's latest.
Apogee monitors these, plus the gaming, shareware, and Apogee support
}conferences on Fidonet, Rime, and Intelec.

[1.7.2]  Apogee's Internet mailing list

}Apogee has an Internet mailing list for press releases, announcements for
}newly released games, slide shows, or important patches, and other
}miscellaneous information.  The traffic is sporadic and very minimal.  The
}mailing list includes information about any of Apogee's specialized divisions,
}such as 3D Realms, and is free of charge.
}
}To sign up for the mailing list, send email to majordomo (at) apogee1.com and
}include, in the body of the message, a line reading:
}
}            subscribe info EMAIL
}

}that you're subscribed almost instantly; if you don't, it may be that you
}supplied an incorrect email address.  CompuServe users should supply their
}email addresses in the form XXXXX.XXX (at) compuserve.com.
}
}To unsubscribe yourself from the mailing list, send email reading:
}
}            unsubscribe info EMAIL
}
}...making sure that EMAIL is exactly the same address you used when you
}subscribed.
}
}Further details about the Apogee mailing list may be found on Apogee's web
}site.  The direct URL is:  http://www.apogee1.com/misc/maillist.html.

[1.7.3]  World Wide Web

}You can reach Apogee and all its divisions via the World Wide Web.  The sites

}ordering information for each; press releases; progress reports on games in
}development; live chat areas; and more.

[2.1]  Other Companies

[2.1.1]  What is Apogee's relationship with id?

Joe Siegler's explanation of the relationship between Apogee and id follows:

Apogee and id Software are two completely different companies.  They
always have been, always will be.  Apogee doesn't own id; id doesn't own
Apogee; nor is one a division of the other.

Apogee Software writes and distributes software.  Of the many games that
Apogee has published, only a handful have not been written by Apogee as
well.  id Software wrote three of these games, namely, Keen Vorticons, Keen
Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D.

id Software writes software, and up until Doom, had never published anything
themselves.  id has published through a few companies, Apogee being one of
them.  As mentioned before, Keen Vorticons, Keen Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D
were distributed by Apogee.  (At later dates, id went on and also published
Keen Galaxy and Wolf3D in the stores through GT Software, but that's another
story.)  Some earlier id efforts such as Catacomb 3D are distributed
through Softdisk.  (Technically, these early games, such as Catacomb 3D,
Dangerous Dave, and Rescue Rover, are Softdisk games, not id Software games,
though they were made by the same people who would ultimately found
id Software.  The first game released as an "id Software" game was
Keen: Vorticons.)

id has published three commercial only games.  Two of these were published
by FormGen, those being Keen: Aliens Ate My Babysitter and Spear of Destiny.
These two are quite frequently assumed to be Apogee games, but they are not.
Check them; the name Apogee does not appear within.  Apogee does, however,
*resell* those two games, adding to the confusion.  But again, they do not
distribute them; they only sell them.  Apogee has to buy them from FormGen
like any other computer store would.  The third id retail game is Doom II,
published in the retail markets by GT Software.

Starting with Doom, id has been publishing on their own. Apogee has absolutely
nothing to do with Doom, nor future titles by id Software.  Furthermore,
starting with the release of Heretic, id Software will also be publishing games
on their own label.  They licensed their Doom engine to two companies, Raven
}Software and Cygnus Studios (whose credits include Raptor).  (The game
}produced by Cygnus Studios was cancelled and picked up by a company called
}Rogue.) The two games produced under this agreement (Heretic and Strife
}respectively), were published under the "id" label exactly the same way that
}id Software themselves published Wolfenstein 3D under the "Apogee" label.

There has been no "big divorce," or "feud" or something along those lines
between id and Apogee.  The id crew and the Apogee crew are all good friends,
and in fact get together every once in a while to shoot pool at the id
offices.  Other mutual activities include paintball (which also involves
Cygnus).  There was never a fallout between Apogee and id.  Anyone implying
this is attempting to drive a wedge where it doesn't belong or exist.

[2.1.2]  What's Apogee's relationship with Softdisk?

Daniel Tobias' (senior programmer/editor for Softdisk) explanation of the
relationship between Apogee, id, and Softdisk follows:

Apogee and Softdisk are two companies whose paths have crossed time and
again since Scott Miller submitted Kingdom of Kroz to them on November 26,
1987.  It won second place in Softdisk's CodeQuest '87 and published on
issue #20 of Softdisk's subscription software product "Big Blue Disk"
(which later became "On Disk Monthly" and, finally, "Softdisk PC").  Scott
Miller continued to submit his games, listed below:

   Title                  Submitted     Issue/Date
   -----                  ---------     ----------
   Kingdom of Kroz        11/26/87      BBD #20, 06/88
   Computer Quiz          01/20/88      BBD #21, 07/88
   Astronomy Quiz         01/20/88      BBD #26, 11/88
   Maze Runner            01/20/88      BBD #26, 12/88
   BASIC Quiz             01/20/88      BBD #28, 02/89
   Dungeons of Kroz       01/20/88      BBD #29, 03/89
   Meteors                03/12/88      BBD #30, 04/89
   Block Five             01/20/88      BBD #32, 06/89
   Caverns of Kroz        04/22/89      BBD #35, 09/89
   Castle of Kroz         08/31/89      BBD #47, 09/90

These are available as back issues of the Big Blue Disk; only the Kroz games
are currently available from Apogee.

Apogee's Vice President George Broussard wrote a game for Softdisk under
contract called "Scubadventure," which was published as part of a defunct
monthly game disk subscription from Softdisk and also sold as a stand alone
}item.  Scubadventure came about when Scott Miller, intrigued by id Software's
}Catacomb 3D, wanted to contract id to make a 3D shareware game for him.  id
}was reluctant, instead intending to make another Commander Keen game, but
}Scott Miller gave them several proposals all of which guaranteed a large sum
}of money.  However, id was obligated to make another game for Softdisk, so
}Apogee made an arrangement whereby Apogee would make a game for Softdisk,
}thus freeing id to write a 3D game for Apogee.  id's game for Apogee was, of
}course, Wolfenstein 3D, and Apogee's game for Softdisk was Scubadventure.

Apogee's Keith Schuler also made a submission to Softdisk, namely,
"Chagunitzu," the forerunner of Apogee's "Paganitzu."  This was published
by Softdisk on Big Blue Disk #44 (dated 6/90).

The id team also has its ties with Softdisk.  Originally, the people who
ultimately founded id Software worked for Softdisk and wrote numerous
games for them.

Games done as full-time employees of Softdisk:
      Catacomb         [2D game published first as an Apple II version on
                        Softdisk #114, then ported to the PC for BBD #50]
      Dangerous Dave   [published on a game "sampler disk"]
      Catacomb II      [later changed to "The Catacomb"]
      Slordax
      Rescue Rover
      Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion
      Hovertank 3D

Games done on a contract basis after the id group left:
      Keen Dreams
      Rescue Rover 2
      Catacomb 3D
      Tiles of the Dragon

Solo works of John Romero:
      Twilight Treasures    [on BBD #35]
      Zappa Roids           [on BBD #36]
      Pyramids of Egypt     [on BBD #46]

Solo works of John Carmack:
      Dark Designs I        [on BBD #52]
      Dark Designs II       [on BBD #54]

Keen Dreams was released in a shareware version by Softdisk (latest shareware
release is v1.20), as well as various registered, catalog, and retail
editions.  (Apogee does not distribute Keen Dreams -- those who would like it
should contact Softdisk.)

The 3D game, "Catacomb Abyss," was not written by the id crew, but rather a
team of Softdisk programmers, headed by Greg Malone, after they had left.
The engine for "Catacomb Abyss," however, was the Catacomb 3D engine
previously written by id.  "Catacomb Abyss" is part of a trilogy along with
"Catacomb Apocalypse" and "Catacomb Armageddon."  Greg Malone later became
}the creative director for Duke Nukem 3D and, for the first half of its
}production, Shadow Warrior, two of 3D Realms' games.

Of the various people mentioned elsewhere in this FAQ, the following are
former full-time Softdisk employees:  Jason Blochowiak, Adrian Carmack,
John Carmack, Tom Hall, Jerry K. Jones, Greg Malone, Michael Maynard, John
Romero, and James T. Row.

[2.1.3]  What's Apogee's relationship with Parallax?

}Originally, the game Descent, written by Parallax and distributed by Interplay,

}was to be an Apogee game.  Due to financial issues, Apogee cancelled it, and
}Interplay picked it up.  However, the game was apparently under Apogee's roof
}long enough to make an impression on the final product.  In the credits for
}Descent, there is a thank you note to "Scott Miller and Apogee Software."
}Apogee's Joe Siegler asked Descent's project leader, Mike Kulas, about this
}credit.  Mike's response is given below:

          Hi Joe,

          We put Scott and Apogee in there because we truly appreciate
          all that Apogee did for us.  Scott showed a lot of faith in
          us when we didn't really have anything to show anybody.  If
          not for Scott, I don't think we would be anywhere near where
          we are today.

          You can tell people exactly this, if you like.

          Mike

[2.2]  What Awards Has Apogee Won?

Apogee has won over a hundred national and international awards -- far too
many to list here -- but here are some of the highlights:

    Commander Keen    - Best Entertainment Software         - 1992
    Commander Keen    - Best Overall                        - 1992
    Math Rescue       - Best Education Software             - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D    - Best Entertainment Software         - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D    - Best New Home, Hobby, Entertainment - 1993
    Wolfenstein 3D    - Best Overall, People's Choice       - 1993
}   Terminal Velocity - Editor's Choice Award               - 1995

[2.3]  The Apogee Theme Song

The earliest hint of a theme song for Apogee Software might have been in such
early games as Crystal Caves and Secret Agent, wherein the then Apogee logo
was accompanied by a series of trills uttered by the PC speaker.  It was
less of a theme song and more of a "semi-standard opening" for Apogee games
at the time.  The first real appearance of the familiar Apogee theme song,
was in the game Major Stryker.  Today, any Apogee fan will instantly recognize
the Apogee theme song and will probably be capable of humming it on command.
The Apogee theme song is a short, simple, but sweet few bars, and one could
easily imagine it as a theme in a symphony or fugue.

Lee Jackson's paraphrased history of the Apogee theme song follows:

Robert "Bobby" Prince, the composer of the scores of numerous Apogee games,
did the original theme song, which appeared essentially unaltered in Major
Stryker, Monster Bash, Bio Menace, Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, and Blake
Stone: Planet Strike.  He composed a "rock"-like version for Duke Nukem II,
which was later used in Raptor v1.2.  (Previous versions of Raptor had a
version of the theme much like the original.)

For Halloween Harry (Alien Carnage) and Mystic Towers, something different
was needed.  These used MOD music instead of the MIDI-style used in our other
games, so a new file was needed.  The folks at SubZero composed a dramatic
version for Harry; an appropriately silly version was made for Mystic Towers.

I took over the MIDI version of the fanfare starting with Hocus Pocus.  It
wasn't something I was asked to do -- I just played around with an idea, gave
it to Tom Hall and Joe Siegler, who then played it for Scott Miller and
George Broussard, who dubbed it the "John Williams fanfare."  (It was actually
an attempt to emulate the MOD file that SubZero did for Harry -- I always
liked it.)  This fanfare has, to date, appeared in Hocus Pocus, Wacky Wheels,
Boppin, and Rise of the Triad.  It is the current "official Apogee fanfare."

[2.4]  The Dopefish

}(Note:  As of October 1995, a Dopefish web page became available at the URL
}http://www.apogee1.com/dopefish.html.  The Dopefish page contains a modified
}version of the following text, plus links to images, animation, sounds, and
}music of the various art and memorabilia mentioned herein.)

The history of the Dopefish, as told by Lee Jackson and Joe Siegler:

Dopefish is the product of the fertile mind of Tom Hall.  It was one of twenty
four drawings he did of ideas for characters for Commander Keen: Goodbye,
Galaxy! while part of id Software.  Dopefish was one of the characters from
these drawings that made the cut.  According to Tom, "I just drew this stupid
little fish," and the rest is history.

}Dopefish is described in the cast of characters for "Commander Keen: Secret
}of the Oracle" (Keen 4, the shareware episode of "Commander Keen: Goodbye
}Galaxy!") as the second dumbest creature in the universe (the number one
ranking is anyone's guess).  His thought patterns go, "swim swim hungry, swim
swim hungry."  Dopefish "will eat anything alive and moving near them, though
}they prefer heroes."  Dopefish appears in the level of Keen 4 entitled "The
}Well of Wishes."

}Dopefish was "adopted" by the Tech Support staff at Apogee soon after Joe
}Siegler was hired.  When Steve Quarrella and Lee Jackson joined the company,
}it ballooned from there.  Dopefish was Joe's favorite character, and Steve
}was the resident Keen expert.  Lee provided a few vocal effects and some
}art.  They got hold of some screen capture software and went to town.

}The Dopefish "product line" started with an ANSI screen which Joe and Lee did.
}Joe converted a screen capture to raw ANSI, and Lee cleaned it up and made it
}presentable.  After this, we convinced Jay Wilbur (formerly of id Software)
to have some Dopefish polo shirts made from an EPS file of the front-facing
burping Dopefish (a.k.a. "Burpfish").  When Christmas rolled around, Brenda
}Jackson (Lee's wife) decided we needed to bring Dopefish into the real world,
so she made 20 or so stuffed Dopefish dolls (mostly side view, with a couple
of Burpfish for good measure).  These were done in both EGA (green) and CGA
(purple) versions and were given out at the Apogee Christmas party that year.
When Jay Wilbur heard of this, his first thought was that they needed to get a
life.  For Christmas 1993, Brenda took a printed enlargement of a screen
capture and did pixel-for-pixel-accurate needlepoint tree ornaments, and Joe
had coffee cups made with a Burpfish on them.  Below the Burpfish on the mugs
is the caption, "Eat Your Veggies!" which is the title of the music for the
level that Dopefish appears in, composed by Bobby Prince.  Brenda also made a
mobile of Dopefish for Christmas 1994, but due to extreme delays in getting it
done, it was never delivered until July 1995.

Please note that this Dopefish merchandise is not, and was never, for
sale to the general public.  They were all strictly in-house gags, so
please don't swamp Apogee with requests for any of these items.  However,
if you're a Dopefish fan and have created some goofy Dopefish items yourself,
Joe Siegler would love to hear about them.  See the sections on "contacting
Apogee" for information on how to reach him.

Other Dopefish-related items that have appeared include an MS-Windows icon, an
OS/2 icon, an OS/2 Warp startup logo, an OS/2 Warp web explorer animation file,
and a Win95 animated Burpfish icon.  There's also an MS-Windows BMP that Tom
}Hall put together that, when tiled, looks great as a background.  More
}recently, a newer version of the Windows background has a color resolution of
}16.7 million colors.  It was created by a Dopefish fan and is available on the
}Dopefish web page.  Also Joe Siegler has a full-page Dopefish that will
}occasionally mysteriously show up in someone else's fax machine.  On
}November 2, 1995, Matt Long of Software Creations gave Joe a Far Side cartoon
}that originally involved a piranha, but was changed to read "Dopefish."
Dopefish has also appeared in countless taglines, Internet signature files
}(described by Tom Hall as "Pisces Swimeatus;" this graphic appears at the end
}of this FAQ), and even in a reinterpretation of the birth of the universe,
where the Big Bang is replaced by the Big Burp.  Steve even holds the title,
granted via a mail-order ordainment service, as "Pope of the Church of the
Dopey Fish."  The title is legally recognized, by Texas state law.
   
Dopefish mania attained a new high in October 1995 when Joe Siegler, one of
Dopefish's most avid proponents, announced the grand opening of a Dopefish
}web page, called "The Well of Wishes," containing images and sound files of
}the Dopefish's various and diverse incarnations, a Dopefish screen saver, plus
a slightly modified version of this very text.

To date, Dopefish has been involved in three Apogee games:  Commander Keen:
Goodbye, Galaxy! (as a character), Wacky Wheels (making a secret cameo
appearance), and Rise of the Triad (as a command line parameter).  In addition,
}Joe Selinske designed an entire level around the Dopefish, namely the first
}level of the rejected ROTT level set, which is titled "Use the Fish."  If
you load this level up, use the map cheat, and look at the map, you'll see
that the entire level is essentially the Dopefish -- you're playing inside.
}The title "Use the Fish" comes from the fax that Jay Wilbur, then of id
Software, sent Apogee when he granted them permission to use the Dopefish as
a cameo character.  Yet another incarnation of the Dopefish in ROTT is only in
version 1.3 of the game -- when you complete it, there's a picture of a bucked
tooth Joe Siegler (teeth compliments of artist Stephen Hornback) with a
Dopefish pillow (again, made by Lee Jackson's wife Brenda) in his lap.

}Dopefish did, however, almost make an appearance in 3D Realms' Duke Nukem 3D.
}Early in development, there was a shark in Duke Nukem 3D that would show up
}when Duke was underwater.  Originally, if you started the game with "dopefish"
}as a command line parameter, the sharks would be Dopefish instead.  However,
}the sharks were cut from the game and with them went the Dopefish cameo.  At
}the last minute, the sharks were reinstated, but Dopefish was not.  Still, the
}work done for this survives.  The artwork for Dopefish's cancelled Duke cameo,
}by Chuck Jones, is available on the Dopefish web page as an animation file.
}A second animation file is also there of Chuck's first 3D rendered Dopefish,
}spinning in place.  Lee Jackson's music, "DopeJaws," a sinister arrangement
}of Bobby Prince's "Eat Your Veggies" intended for Dopefish's cameo, is also
}available.  The final release of Duke Nukem 3D did, however, contain a
}Dopefish reference.  A hidden message deep in episode one, level five, boldly
}states, "Dopefish Lives!"  In June 1996, a Dopefish fan designed a humorous
}replacement graphic for the registered version of Duke Nukem 3D that turns
}the drones into Dopefish.  That, too, is also available on the Dopefish web
}page.
}
}Dopefish appears in yet another game:  id Software's Quake.  In the shareware
}episode, take the path that leads to the nightmare difficulty level selection
}and shoot the square on the wall at the end of the stairwell -- you'll see
}a cryptic message that says, "The Well of Wishes awaits in the Crypt of
}Decay."  The Crypt of Decay is a level in the registered version of Quake
}(episode two, level three).  The Dopefish appears in a hidden area of this
}level.  Visual instructions for getting to it appears in the Dopefish web
}page.
}
}Music composed for the Dopefish is a tradition in itself.  Bobby Prince's
}original music, called "Eat Your Veggies," was originally intended for the
}Softdisk game, "Keen Dreams," (see the section on the history of Commander
}Keen for further information) but Softdisk insisted that the game fit on a
}360K disk, so the music had to be left out.  Instead, it was incorporated
}into the following Keen game, the first episode of "Commander Keen: Goodbye,
}Galaxy!"  The music appears in more than one level of the game, but is
}commonly referred to by Keen and Dopefish fans as the "Dopefish level music."
}A MIDI file of this was created by Bobby Prince in 1993, and in 1994 it was
}turned backwards as a joke.  Also in 1994, Lee Jackson composed "Fish Polka,"
}for Rise of the Triad and can be heard by using the level warp cheat.  In
}1995, Lee made "DopeJaws," a sinister arrangement of Bobby's "Eat Your
}Veggies," which was intended for the aborted Dopefish cameo in Duke Nukem 3D.
}All of the musical compositions mentioned above can be downloaded from the
}Dopefish web page.
}
}As if Dopefish mania were not nerdly enough, in December 1996, Apogee received
}a letter from a person (then) living on a US Army Base on Kwajalein in the
}Marshall Islands who was going to high school there.  Their school has a
}tradition where seniors spraypaint something on the sidewalk.  This student
}spraypainted "Dopefish."  A picture of it was taken shortly before a school
}official decided that he didn't like the word "dope" and had it painted over.

Why Dopefish?  Well, he swims, he eats, and he burps.  What more can you ask
for?  I personally think that the latter reason is why Joe likes him so much.
Joe is known for a few wall rattlers and personally did the voice of Dopefish
in Wacky Wheels and Rise of the Triad.  He really practiced for it, too.
Sitting at his computer at four in the morning with a two liter bottle of
Diet Coke, he ran through take after take, hurting himself a couple times
in the process, until he came up with just the right length and resonance.

Even though the Dopefish belongs to id Software, he is a welcome adopted
member of the Apogee family.  If there are ever any new Keen games, you can
wager a goodly amount that the Dopefish will be in it.

[2.5]  Flash

Many people wonder what the peculiar ASCII drawing is that appears frequently
in Joe Siegler's signature file.  (A replica appears at the end of this FAQ.)
On some terminals, the drawing is difficult to recognize; on others, it's
}quite easy.  It's Flash, Joe's female tabby cat, born in mid 1993, named after
the dog on "The Dukes of Hazzard."  In Joe's words, he's "a 'mutt' cat, no
special breed, but a cool cat anyway."  The ASCII drawing is by Glenda Moore,
a Software Creations user.

}For version 6.0 of this FAQ, I had initially dropped two sections; this
}section on Flash (for its peripheral relevance), and the Apogee game ratings
}section (for its subjectivity and difficulty to maintain).  Joe Siegler sent
}mail back, saying, "I never cared much about the ratings section, but Flash?
}It was such a tiny section!"  In spite of my insistence to stay rigidly on
}topic, Joe's admittedly understated yet persistent prodding and needling,
}culminating in an explicit request for me to include his Flash-related quote
}at the end of this FAQ, persuaded me to restore Flash's proverbial five
}minutes of fame to this document.  I did, however, point out that were Flash
}to be featured as a cameo in a future Apogee game, her representation in the
}FAQ would be more fully justified.  We shall see.

[2.6]  History of Specific Games

[2.6.1]  The Kroz Series

Scott Miller had been programming games since 1975, when he was in high
school.  "Caverns of Kroz" was the very first Kroz game, written in Turbo
Pascal and originally endowed with the simple title "Kroz."  It was sold to
the disk magazine I.B.Magazette, as was the second Kroz adventure, "Dungeons
of Kroz" (originally titled "Kroz II").  In 1987, Scott wrote "Kingdom of
Kroz" and, with the full knowledge that, at the time, 99% of shareware was
not profitable for its authors, released it into the shareware market.  Thus,
it was a mystifying surprise when Kroz turned out to be a smash hit.  The
}letters poured in, expressing love for the game and demanding sequels.  One
}of the reasons it was so successful, besides the merit of the game itself, was
}its then new marketing scheme; Kroz was the first game to be split into
}smaller episodes, with one episode released as shareware.

In 1988, Kingdom of Kroz I received top honors in the game category of
Softdisk's CodeQuest '87, a national programming contest, and came in second
overall (it lost to a spreadsheet program).  Scott Miller himself said, in the
notes to a later version of the game, "Thanks to Kroz, I now know what a mutual
fund is, but on the downside my taxes require a book two inches thick to
figure out."

In short, Kroz marked Apogee's birth, emergence into the national
mainstream, and coronation as one of the earliest kings of shareware.

What inspired Kroz?  At the time, Scott Miller's favorite games were
M.U.L.E., Archon, and Spelunker, among others.  He liked games where puzzle
solving was first, and the action secondary.  Kroz's main inspiration was
probably Rogue, which Scott used to play, but disliked for its randomness
and reliance on chance.  So Kroz was born.  Another of Scott's favorite
games is evident from the title; Kroz spelled backwards is "Zork," one of
Infocom's most famous and successful text adventure games.

The various episodes and versions of Kroz are many.  To confuse the issue,
Kroz, as well as many of the other early Apogee games, were not sold
strictly in a single bundle of three or four episodes.  The shareware
episode, Kingdom of Kroz, could be registered at a cost of $7.50, and this
registration made the customer eligible to buy other episodes at $7.50 each,
or several episodes at some savings.  The episodes of Kroz are as follows:

              1.  Caverns of Kroz
              2.  Dungeons of Kroz
              3.  Kingdom of Kroz
              4.  Return to Kroz
              5.  Temple of Kroz
              6.  The Final Crusade of Kroz
              7.  The Lost Adventures of Kroz

"Return To Kroz" was published in two separate disk magazines, under different
titles.  One title was "Shrine of Kroz"; the other, "Castle of Kroz."  Scott
finally decided upon the "Return to Kroz" title because he liked the title to
the third Star Wars movie.  Similarly, "Valley of Kroz" was an alternate title
given to "Temple of Kroz."

Episodes 1-3 comprised "The Kroz Trilogy," and originally published on
Softdisk's Big Blue Disk series.  These episodes were later redone in 1990,
their names changing to "Caverns of Kroz II," "Dungeons of Kroz II," and
"Kingdom of Kroz II."  Since Kingdom of Kroz II had significant map changes
to 17 different levels, the original "Kingdom of Kroz I" remained available
for purchase to registered owners of "Kingdom of Kroz II."

Episodes 4-6 comprised "The Super Kroz Trilogy."  These contained more
levels, more items, and more effects.  This trilogy was intended to complete
the Kroz series, but the letters kept pouring in, including one from
Patricia Baker, RI, who said, "I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and
was sorry tonight to finally find the Amulet."

So one final episode of Kroz was to be made, namely Episode 7, "The Lost
Adventures of Kroz."  This contained 75 new levels, and, as such, was sold
at the slightly steeper rate of $20.  As said earlier, however, the rates
were lowered if more episodes were purchased at once.  In early 1991, one
could buy the first six episodes for $35 total, or $45 for all seven.

"The Lost Adventures of Kroz" was the final episode to be completed.  At
one time, another episode had been planned for release in March 1991
entitled "The Underground Empire of Kroz," but this never saw the light of
day.  Apogee, along with the rest of the gaming community, started moving
on toward more ambitious projects.

Unlike most of Apogee's early games, the Kroz series is still commercially
available from Apogee.  The episodes you'll get upon a $24.95 registration are
the revised Kroz Trilogy, the Super Kroz Trilogy, and the Lost Adventures.
You cannot buy the individual episodes for Kroz or any other Apogee game any
longer; Apogee stopped doing this in mid 1993.

[2.6.2]  Commander Keen

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Keen series:

The seven Commander Keen games were all written by id Software.
They are:

  1) Marooned on Mars    ---\

Episodes 1-3 are collectively called "Invasion of the Vorticons,"
and are published by Apogee Software.   This series of Commander Keen
}was released on December 14th, 1990, according to Tom Hall, then Creative
}Director for id Software and, later, for Apogee.

Episodes 4 and 5 are collectively called "Goodbye Galaxy," and are also
published by Apogee Software.  This series of Commander Keen was
released somewhere around June of 1991.  There was also a special CGA
edition of Keens 4-5.  The CGA version is functionally identical to the
standard EGA version of the game, but with CGA graphics.

Episode 6 is a stand-alone game which uses the Keen 4-5 engine, entitled
"Aliens Ate My Babysitter."  This episode of Keen is distributed by FormGen
as commercial software.  This is also sold by Apogee, but Apogee only resells
this product; we don't actually distribute it.  FormGen also decided to put
off-disk copy protection on the full version of this game.  Furthermore,
FormGen also has a playable three level commercial demo available for perusal
before purchase.  Apogee Software also sells a version of Keen 6 in CGA.
}In mid 1996, however, FormGen discontinued Keen 6.  As such, it's very hard to
}get now.  As of February 1997, Apogee still has Keen 6 for sale, but only what
}is left in stock (5 1/4" double density disks).  Once they're gone, that's it.

Keen Dreams has kind of an interesting story.  This is referred to as
the "Lost Episode" of Commander Keen.   I like to think of it as "Keen
Episode 3.5."  The reason is that Keen Dreams falls in between
Vorticons and Galaxy both in terms of technology and story line.
Before the id guys actually formed id, the majority of them worked at
Softdisk, a computer software publisher in Shreveport, LA.  The
founding members of id Software left Softdisk to do the Vorticons
series of Keen for Apogee Software.  However, they were contractually
obligated to deliver another game to Softdisk, and since development
had started on the Galaxy series, they threw together a Keen game for
Softdisk, and Keen Dreams was born.  This game is not sold by Apogee
Software, nor does Apogee have anything at all to do with it.  You'd
need to contact Softdisk for any further information regarding Keen
Dreams.

Episodes 1, 3.5, 4, and the 3 level demo for Episode 6 are
the only ones that you are legally allowed to upload and download
anywhere.  Episodes 2, 3, 5, and the full version of Episode 6 are
commercial software, and should not appear on any BBS, online service,
or should otherwise be sold except for authorized sellers of the
games.

}In December 1996, id Software published a package called "The id
}Anthology".  This product contains every single game that id Software
}ever made, as well as some others that were made by id people for other
}companies like Softdisk.  Included in this package are all seven Commander
}Keen games.  As a side note, for some reason, the person at id Software who
}put the package together put in only the CGA version of Keen 6.  Why they
}did this, we don't know.  For more information on the id Anthology, contact
}id Software (Apogee has nothing to do with the id Anthology.)

Here are the BBS filenames as currently available from Apogee for the
various Keen games from Apogee.

        Keen 1 -> #1KEEN.ZIP
        Keen 4 -> #4KEEN.ZIP
        Keen 4 -> #4KEENC.ZIP (Special CGA Version)

I've seen the 3 level Aliens Demo available with the filename
#6K-DEMO.ZIP and K6DEMO.ZIP.  I've seen Keen Dreams available with
the filename KDREAMS.ZIP.  However, neither of these are Apogee
products, and I cannot vouch for the files' names.

If you played Keen 5, you may have noticed a screen that said something to
the effect of, "Join us in December 1992 for the greatest Keen adventure
yet."  There was a picture of Keen smiling, with a Santa Claus hat on.
At the time, id Software was intending to do a third series of
Commander Keen, tentatively entitled "Commander Keen: The Universe is
Toast."  However, other projects came up (Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of
}Destiny, and later, Doom).  There are no serious plans now to do more
}Keen.  The main reason for this is that id Software owns the rights
}to Commander Keen, and any new project would have to be either done
}by them (extremely unlikely), or at least approved by them.   At this
}time, there are no Keen games under development by either Apogee, id,
}or Ion Storm (where Tom Hall & John Romero now work as of 1997), and
}if and when there ever is more Keen, it will be state of the art
}of whatever technology is current at the time.

On a different note, Commander Keen, and artifacts from the Keen games have
found their way into other games.  Commander Keen is listed in the default
scoreboards of a handful of Apogee games, mentioned in the instructions of
one, and has made a few more prominent appearances, which are listed under
the "Cameos" section of this FAQ.  Also, see the section on "What's B. J.
Blazkowicz's relationship with Commander Keen?" for information on that.

Finally, you can visit the Keen: Vorticons page of the Apogee WWW pages to see

}[2.6.3]  Crystal Caves and Secret Agent
}
}Originally, Crystal Caves and Secret Agent were developed at George
}Broussard's Company, Micro F/X.  The author, Frank Maddin, poked fun at the
}Apogee/id game Commander Keen by including Keen's helmet in a level of
}Crystal Caves, partially obscured by some junk and debris.  Half way through
}the games' development (and after the helmet was put in), George Broussard
}became Scott Miller's partner at Apogee and dissolved Micro F/X.  The
}as yet unfinished games Crystal Caves and Secret Agent came with him to become
}Apogee games.  Keen's helmet was left in as an inside joke.

[2.6.4]  Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II

There is frequently a great deal of confusion over the correct spelling of one
of Apogee's most prized characters, Duke Nukem.  The original spelling for the
name was "Duke Nukem"; however, during the code fix stage between v1.0 and
v2.0 of the original game, Apogee found a character overseas named "Duke
Nukem" that was thought to be copyrighted.  So, for v2.0 of the original Duke
game, the name was changed to "Duke Nukum."  Then, during the programming of
Duke II, it was discovered that the character they found overseas was not
copyrighted after all -- and so the original name was reinstated.  "Duke
}Nukem" is also the spelling used in all successive games that featured the
}character.

The spellings "Duke Nuke 'em," "Duke Nuke'um," "Duke Nuke'm," "Duke Nuk'em"
and other variations are not, and were never, correct.

[2.6.5]  Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny

}It started when a 3D game id made for Softdisk grabbed Scott Miller's
}attention.  He decided that he'd like id to make a 3D shareware game for
}Apogee and convinced a somewhat reluctant id to agree.  However, at the time,
}id was obligated to make a game for Softdisk, so Apogee made a deal in which
}Apogee would make a game for Softdisk, thereby freeing id to write the 3D game
}for Apogee.  Apogee's game for Softdisk was "Scubadventure," written by George
}Broussard; id's game for Apogee was the now legendary Wolfenstein 3D.

Joe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Wolfenstein series from this
point follows:

On May 5, 1992, Apogee Software released the shareware episode of Wolfenstein
3D, and has been distributing it in the shareware market since.  Apogee
is the official distributor of Wolfenstein 3D's original six episodes in the
shareware market.

Somewhere around September of 1992, FormGen Corp released Spear of Destiny.
This is a retail sequel to Wolfenstein 3D.  This game consisted of one episode
with 20 levels.  This game consists of some new wall art, a couple of new
objects, and new boss creatures.  This game is essentially the same as Wolf3D
generally, but is completely new in the level design aspect.  This game is
available in stores like CompUSA.  Apogee also resells this product, but is not
responsible for its distribution.  Apogee has to buy it from FormGen
like any other store would.  There is a two level playable demo floating around
for Spear of Destiny.  It's the same first two levels that appear in the full
version of the game.  It is not shareware; commercial demos are for the most
part non-interactive, however, this one *is* interactive, and since it bears
a close resemblance to Wolfenstein 3D, which is shareware, the SOD demo is
frequently mistaken for being shareware, which it is not.

There have been numerous editors and extra levels created by users for both
Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny.  With regard to Wolf3D, Apogee
respectfully requests that you not make or distribute any editors, extra
levels, or other add-ons that will work on the shareware episode.  If you
choose to make add-ons, please make these items for the registered version
only, and be aware that Apogee cannot support user-created items.

Sometime in mid/late 1993, id Software decided that they were going to publish
these same six original episodes in the retail market.  These are the same six
episodes that Apogee had been selling since May of 1992.  Since Apogee was at
that time not set up for retail distribution, id Software went with another
company called is GT Software.  This package is available in CompUSA and
contains the same six episodes that Apogee distributes.  Apogee has absolutely
nothing at all to do with this product.  The GT Software version of
Wolfenstein 3D is totally a GT product.  Apogee has no control over the
packaging, quality control, or price.

In May of 1994, FormGen Corporation released two new episodes for Spear of
Destiny to stores.  The collective name of the product is "Spear of Destiny
Mission Add-On Packs."  The new episodes each have their own individual
titles, these being "Mission 2: Return to Danger," and "Mission 3: Ultimate
Challenge."  These add-ons have some new level graphics and some differently
colored actors, but is essentially more levels for Spear of Destiny.  These
extra versions require that you have the first Spear of Destiny game (the
}original six Apogee Wolf3D episodes are not required).  In late 1994, FormGen
}marketed a "Spear of Destiny Super CD Package," which consists of id's
}original Spear of Destiny, the two additional add-on missions, and hint books
}for these new episodes.  Neither Apogee Software nor id software sells the
}add-ons or the CD, supports it, or has anything else to do with it.  These are
}strictly FormGen products.

id Software has also either written or released versions of Wolfenstein 3D for
other platforms over time.  Apogee Software has nothing to do with any
of them.  id Software holds the copyright to Wolfenstein 3D and can
license it to others for other platforms or do whatever they want with it.
These versions are listed for completeness' sake only.

The Super Nintendo version was released around Jan/Feb of 1994.  This was
published through a company called "Imagineer."  Due to Nintendo restrictions,
some elements of the game had to be removed.  These were all Nazi references,
the dogs (replaced with rats), and blood (replaced with sweat).  This is still
a good game, especially considering what it's programmed for.  There was a
version released for the Atari Jaguar around August of 1994, and this version
is probably the best graphically of any version published.  When you go up
right against walls and the like, they do not become as blocky or chunky, as
compared to previous versions of Wolfenstein 3D.  This version was published
by Atari.  id also licensed Wolf3D so that it could be published on the
Macintosh computer.  This version was released in October 1994 and is being
distributed by MacPlay, a division of Interplay.  WolfMac is a shareware
title, and there is a shareware version of it available.  When you register,
you get something like 30 levels.  Again, Apogee has nothing to do with these
versions of Wolfenstein 3D; you would need to contact the various companies,
or id Software directly for more information on them.  In the fall of 1994,
it was revealed that Vitesse was working on a version of Wolfenstein 3D for
the Apple IIgs.  This version was being done by Bill Heinemann.  This brings
the Wolfenstein saga full circle as the original Castle Wolfenstein was
written for the Apple //e.  As of August 95, this still has not been released
due to program delays.  It is still planned for release at this time, however.

Sometime in August/September 1995, id Software release the source code for
Wolfenstein 3D to the Internet and CompuServe.  It does not contain the code
for the levels and graphics, however, so you'll need the data files from the
shareware or commercial versions of the game for it to work properly.

The premiere issue of Game Developer's Magazine stated that Apogee Software was
working on a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II," which was to be a totally
new game, with completely new actors, and new everything; the only thing the
same being the title Wolfenstein 3D.   This information is partially
incorrect; there is no such title under production at either Apogee or id
Software.  However, this was under production at Apogee for a while back in
early 1994, but this was dropped, and the project changed to "Rise of the
Triad."  This game is now available from Apogee Software.

[2.6.5.1]  "Call Apogee and say Aardwolf"

Joe Siegler's explanation of "Aardwolf":

"Call Apogee and say Aardwolf."  It's a sign that to this day is something
that I get asked about a lot.  This is a sign that appears on a wall in a
particularly nasty maze in Episode 2 Level 8 of Wolfenstein 3D.  The sign
was to be the goal in a contest Apogee was going to have, but almost
immediately after the game's release, a large amount of cheat and mapping
programs were released.  With these programs running around, we felt that
it would have been unfair to have the contest and award a prize.  The sign
was still left in the game, but in hindsight, probably should have been
taken out, since we still get calls now, almost three years after the game's
release.

Also, in a somewhat related issue, letters were shown after the highest score
in the score table in some revisions of the game.  These letters were to be
part of another contest that got scrapped before it got started, where we were
going to have people call in with their scores and tell us the code; we'd then
be able to verify their score.  However, with the cheat programs out there,
this got scrapped too.

}Basically, "Aardwolf" and the letters mean nothing now.  Also note that if
}you found the Aardwolf sign in the game (without cheating), there's a VERY
}strong chance that you're stuck in there.  The only way out may be to restart,
}or load a saved game from before you went into that maze.

[2.6.5.2]  What's B. J. Blazkowicz's relationship with Commander Keen?

Besides the fact that id Software created both the Commander Keen and
Wolfenstein games, there is a further relationship between the two main
characters.  The following is an excerpt from the Official Hint Manual for
Wolfenstein 3D which explains the relation:

      William Joseph Blazkowicz was born August 15, 1911, to Polish
      immigrants.  Blazkowicz was a top spy for the Allied Forces,
      receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor and other accolades
      for heroism.  "B.J.," (as he was called by his friends) married
      after World War II, at age 40, to Julia Marie Peterson.  Their
      son, Arthur Kenneth Blazkowicz, became a television talk show
      personality in Milwaukee.  For show biz purposes, Arthur changed
      his last name to Blaze.  Arthur later married Susan Elizabeth
      McMichaels.  They had one son (which they named after Arthur's
      father), William Joseph Blazkowicz II, or as he signs his grade
      school homework, B. Blaze....

[2.6.6]  Halloween Harry and Alien Carnage

Halloween Harry was written by Sub-Zero software, located in Australia.
Apogee is the game's distributor.  In October of 1993, Apogee released
v1.1 of Halloween Harry in the United States.  As with both Mystic Towers
and Wacky Wheels, the first American version was 1.1, not 1.0.  The reason
for this is that an incomplete version of the game was released overseas
as a magazine's cover program and referred to as v1.0.

A month later, v1.2 of the game was released.  A year after that, Apogee
suggested a title change to "Alien Carnage."  Sub-Zero agreed.  Thus, in
early November of 1994, "Halloween Harry" was dropped from Apogee's
distribution, and "Alien Carnage" added.  Alien Carnage v1.0 is essentially
Halloween Harry v1.2 with a name change, price change, and episode
reorganization.  The shareware version of Alien Carnage (its first episode)
is Halloween Harry's episode three.  With the exception of this
reorganization, Alien Carnage consists of the same episodes as Halloween
Harry.  The shareware version of Halloween Harry is still legal to
distribute; however, Apogee prefers you distribute the shareware version of
Alien Carnage only, as this version has the new pricing information
screens.

}[2.6.7]  Wacky Wheels and Mystic Towers
}
}At the time of its release, in October of 1994, the registered version of
}Wacky Wheels was available in two forms:  a regular version, containing three
}sets of tracks, for $24.95; and an "upgrade edition," containing an additional
}three sets of tracks, for $34.95.  The upgrade could be also purchased
}separately for $20.  Presently, Apogee only registers the larger, six track
}set, $34.95 version of Wacky Wheels.
}
}Version 1.0 of Wacky Wheels, Mystic Towers, and Halloween Harry were actually
}incomplete versions of the games released to a magazine in the UK.  The first
}complete, public release of these games was version 1.1.

}[2.6.8]  Boppin
}
}At the time of its release, in November of 1994, the registered version of
}Boppin was available in two forms:  Basic Boppin, which contained only the
}first two episodes of the game including the shareware version, for $19.95;
}and Super Boppin, which contained all four episodes and a level editor, for
}$29.95.  Owners of Basic Boppin could upgrade to Super Boppin at additional
}cost.  Since then, Apogee has discontinued Basic Boppin and only registers
}Super Boppin.
}
}The initial version of Boppin contained a disturbing, gory logo, as well as
}bloody suicide sequences when you failed to solve one of the puzzles correctly.

}These were put in the game by the company that made it, Accursed Toys.
}However, Apogee, Boppin's distributor, found the gore to be gratuitous and out
}of place and attached a message to the game disclaiming the violent aspects of
}the game.  The suicide sequences could be turned off once inside the game, but
}the logo could not.  Accursed Toys received enough email protesting the gore
}so that, in v1.1 of Boppin, the default was to not show any of it.  A command
}line parameter, "blood," now has to be given to turn it back on.

[2.6.9]  Rise of the Triad

Back in early 1994, a game called "Wolfenstein 3D: Part II" was under
production.  This was dropped, and the project became "Rise of the Triad," or,
as it is casually known, "ROTT."  Version 1.0 was released on December 21,
1994; in February 1995, versions 1.1 and 1.2 were released.  Version 1.2 was
supposed to have fixed the problem that 1.1 introduced where 4 meg machines
could not play at all.  As it turned out, 1.2 did not fix that, and a 1.2a
patch was released a week later.  At this point, the CD version of ROTT was
burned (but not the Site License version).  After that started shipping, a
bug was found where people playing directly from the CD could not save games.
So 1.2b was released to fix this.  Since this was a CD only bug, a version 1.2b
was not released for the shareware version or disk based registered version.
The Site License version was produced after v1.2b, so that does not exist as
a version prior to 1.2b.  Version 1.3 was released for all shareware and
registered versions in August 1995.  The disk based registered version was
available starting in late February; the regular CD based registered version
started shipping in March, and the Site License CD started shipping in April.
}Starting January 1997, the registered version of Rise of the Triad was
}available on CD only.  In July 1995, Apogee released a package of rejected
}ROTT levels, available for free in the file ROTT_REJ.ZIP.
}
}Late that year, Apogee released an add-on pack to "Rise of the Triad" called
}"Extreme Rise of the Triad," which contained an additional 42 levels and some
}new hazards, and sold on CD for $19.95.
}
}In early 1996, Tom Hall and Joe Siegler put together what was the final
}release of ROTT materials from Apogee Software.  A college in Ohio was running
}a gaming contest and was using Rise of the Triad for it.  Apogee created a
}special level pack with four levels for use in this contest.  Two of the
}levels were done by Joe Siegler, and two by Tom Hall.  In February 1996, after
}the contest was held, the file was released to the public for free
}as OHIORTC.ZIP.

Tom Hall, the creative director for Rise of the Triad, dubbed the Rise of the
Triad team the "Developers of Incredible Power" (DIP).  ROTT was the first
release of the Developers of Incredible Power, under that name.  For most of
the members of "DIP," Rise of the Triad was their first real project.  Tom
Hall and Stephen A Hornback were the only ones who had worked extensively
on previous Apogee games.

The principle composer for ROTT was Lee Jackson.  In 1984, Lee Jackson marched
in a Drum and Bugle Corps, called the Nighthawks, out of Houston -- he did pit
percussion and wrote the pit parts for some of the pieces.  In his words,
"this style has a tremendous influence on my writing.  . . .  One chart from
ROTT (Havana Smooth) is almost a pure Corps chart.  . . .  Joe [Siegler] hates
Drum Corps.  [He] absolutely *can* *not* *stand* Drum Corps when he knows what
}he's listening to.  I kind of slipped this song past him."  To this day, Joe
}vehemently denies that this song is a Drum Corps piece.

The name of the shareware version is "Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins."
The name of the registered version is "Rise of the Triad: Dark War," which
contains four new episodes.  The four registered episodes have the titles,
in order, "Approach," "Monastery," "Caves Below," and "The Slow and the Dead."

}[2.6.9.1]  ROTT characters

One of the curiosities of ROTT is that the actors in the game were digitized
and voiced by members of Apogee.  The following chart shows who was scanned
and who was sampled to create each ROTT character.

}[2.6.9.2]  ROTT levels
}
}There are a wealth of levels available for "Rise of the Triad," even if you
}just count the "official" levels made by Apogee.  Some are packaged in various
}versions of the game, some were released separately; some are free, some cost
}money; some are regular (one player) levels, some are Comm-Bat (multiplayer)
}levels.  Below is a description of each of the level sets available from
}Apogee.
}
}  - "Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins" is the name of the standard shareware
}    episode of ROTT.  The shareware episode cannot make use of any other
}    levels besides its own.
}  - "Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins Deluxe Edition" is a special version
}    of the shareware episode distributed ONLY by LaserSoft.  This version has
}    six levels unavailable anywhere else:  three regular levels and three
}    Comm-Bat levels.
}  - "Rise of the Triad: Dark War" is the name of the registered version of
}    ROTT.  There are several versions:  a floppy disk version, an upgraded
}    floppy disk version, a CD version, and a Site License CD version.  (Both
}    floppy disk versions were since discontinued.)  The upgraded floppy disk
}    was the same as the regular CD version, but with fewer "extras."  The
}    Site License CD version had an extra 14 Comm-Bat levels.
}  - The ROTT "rejected level set" was released to the net for free.  It
}    contains levels designed for "Rise of the Triad: Dark War" but eventually
}    cut from the game.  A text file that accompanies this level set explains
}    some of the history behind the levels.
}  - "Extreme Rise of the Triad," or EROTT, is an add-on pack designed by Joe
}    Siegler and Tom Hall.  It contains an additional 42 regular levels usable
}    by the registered version of ROTT and utilize new tricks and traps.
}  - The "Ohio Comm-Bat Pack" is a set of four Comm-Bat levels designed
}    especially for a contest at a college in Ohio.  After the contest, the
}    levels were released to the net for free.
}
}Here is a listing of all the levels for Rise of the Triad and who designed
}each.  The vast bulk of levels were done by Tom Hall, so if no name is given
}for a particular level, he made it.

}[2.6.10] Terminal Velocity
}
}Written by Mark Randel of Terminal Reality, Inc, the lead programmer of
}Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0, Terminal Velocity was the first game ever
}to be released under the 3D Realms label.  The slide show was released on
}April 4, 1995, and the game itself followed on May 1.  And thus, 3D Realms
}emerged into the "realm" of the computer gaming world.
}
}There's a second distinguishing fact about Terminal Velocity; namely, that
}it made the cover of the April 1995 issue of the gaming magazine, "Computer
}Player."  This is the first time in the history of computer gaming that a
}shareware game made the cover of a popular gaming magazine before its
}release.  In the article, many praising comments are made:  "The 3D
}environments are simply breathtaking.  Utilizing cutting-edge real-time
}techniques, the graphics engine creates worlds that are like nothing seen
}before in computer games."  And, "A great deal of attention was spent to
}balance the fast action with the spectacular environment.  Terminal Velocity
}has achieved what many have unsuccessfully tried in the past:  an incredible
}combination of scenery and game play."
}
}There are two noteworthy remarks contained in 3D Realms' initial press
}release for the game.  One is, "Climb into Terminal Velocity now, and you'll
}never go back to flight simulators that offer combat as an 'option.'"
}Wrapping up 3D Realms' plot synopsis is the comment, "You're outgunned,
}outmanned, and strapped into a flying coffin.  But just think how good
}'Saved the Known Galaxy' will look on your resume."
}
}Terminal Reality later made two sequels to Terminal Velocity, both for
}Windows, both distributed by Microsoft:  Fury3 in 1995, and Hellbender
}in 1996.

[2.6.11] Paganitzu and Realms of Chaos

About a year before Keith Schuler wrote Paganitzu for Apogee, he wrote
another game called Chagunitzu for Softdisk.  These two games were almost
identical, containing the same characters and story and so forth.  Unlike
Paganitzu, however, Chagunitzu does not adapt to the speed of your computer,
making it virtually unplayable on fast computers without a program to slow
}the computer down.  (See the section on slowing down your computer in
}this FAQ.)

Following his success with Apogee's Paganitzu, Schuler began a sequel
in early 1992 entitled, "Paganitzu II: The Bloodfire Pendant."  Later, it
went through a name change to "Alabama Smith and the Bloodfire Pendant."
Still later, its name became "Realms of Chaos," losing all its Paganitzu
references in the process.

Realms of Chaos was originally supposed to be a 16 color EGA game, slated
for a 1994 release, but, with the increasing popularity of VGA games, it was
decided that time should be spent converting Realms of Chaos to a 256 color
VGA game.  Finally, after three years in production, Realms of Chaos was
released by Apogee in November 1995.

Contrary to what one might think, the cancelled 3D Realms project
"Ruins: Return of the Gods" was not ever associated with Paganitzu, even in
its early days.

Please note that this information is constantly changing, especially when new
games are added to the list of Apogee products.  Some of the information given
here could become out of date rather quickly.

[3.1.1]  What games are currently available from Apogee?

A list of Apogee games follows. The filename given is the file -- on
CompuServe, BBS's, and the Internet -- which contains the first episode of
each game.  Note that on the Internet, the filenames do not contain the
leading '#' mark.

The price given is the cost of the complete game with all episodes. The "Ep"
field contains the number of episodes in the complete version. The "Ver"
}field contains the latest version number of the game.  "Med" are the media
}that the registered version is available on ("D"=Disk, "C"=CD).  "Gph" is the
}best graphics mode that the game utilizes ("T"=TEXT, "C"=CGA, "E"=EGA,
}"V"=VGA, "S"=SVGA).  The "Size" fields are approximate.

[3.2.2]  Working titles of Apogee games

Sometimes, over the course of a game's development, the game's title can
change, once, twice, or more.  Here is a list of some of Apogee's games with
their former titles.  Where more than one former title is present, they are
listed in chronological order.

}     From Apogee:

Official Title                                                  Working Title
--------------                                                  -------------
Realms of Chaos         Paganitzu II, Alabama Smith and the Bloodfire Pendant

Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure                               The Adventures of Zonk

}     From 3D Realms:
}
}Official Title                                                  Working Title
}--------------                                                  -------------
}Terminal Velocity                                              Velocity Brawl
}
}Sometimes games start out as Apogee games (or at least intended to be Apogee
}games) but end up being distributed by another company.  Frequently, these,
}too, undergo title changes before, during, or after the move from Apogee.
}These games, with their working titles, are given below.
}
}Official Title           Working Title                  Company
}--------------           -------------                  -------
}Doom                     It's Green & Pissed            id Software
}Sango Fighter            Violent Vengeance              Panda Entertainment  *
}PowerSlave               Ruins: Return of the Gods      Playmates Interactive
}Alien Rampage            Ravager                        Inner Circle Creations
}Cyril Cyberpunk          Cyberpunk Kid                  Reality Studios
}
}* - Sango Fighter had already been released; Apogee was merely going to be
}    its U.S. distributor, marketing the game under the title "Violent
}    Vengeance."  This did not pan out.  The game was later released in the
}    U.S. by Panda Entertainment under the original "Sango Fighter" title.

[3.2.2.1]  Alternate titles for Wolfenstein 3D

The following were all alternate titles for Wolfenstein 3D that Tom Hall
came up with.  Many, however, are joke titles and were never seriously
considered -- hence why these names are separate from those in the section
above.  The information comes from the Official Hint Manual for
Wolfenstein 3D.

Castle Ochtenstein, Luger's Run, The Fourth Reich, Adolph's Bane, Hard Cell,
Luger Me Now, Tank You Very Much, Castle Hasselhoff, How Do You Duseldorf?,
Castle Verlassen (to abandon the castle), Sturmwind (stormwind), Hollehammer
(hellhammer; this name made it in to the game as the name of the castle in
episode two), Shattensendener (shadowsender), Geruchschlect (bad smell),
Dolchteufel (devildagger), Grabgrabbener (gravedigger), Eisenschwert
(ironsword), Dammerung (twilight/dawn).

}Since the above information first appeared in this FAQ, Bernd Wolffgramm,
}from Germany, sent me further information about Wolfenstein 3D's names,
}including spelling corrections.  (Some of the spelling mistakes resulted from
}missing umlauts; an alternate spelling for German words containing vowels with
}umlauts is to follow the vowel with an 'e' instead using the accent.)
}
}       - "Duseldorf" should be "Duesseldorf," a town on the Rhine river
}         famous for its beer (Altbier).
}       - "Hollehammer" should be "Hoellenhammer."
}       - "Shattensendener" should be "Schattenspender."
}       - "Geruchschlect" should be "Geruchschlecht."
}       - "Grabgrabbener," is redundant; the word "grab," meaning "grave," is
}         used twice.  A more appropriate word would be "Totengraeber."
}       - "Dammerung" should be "Daemmerung."
}
}Bernd Wolffgramm also provides further information.  Since the game is
}banned in Germany because it involves Nazis and killing Germans, those who
}want to play the game have come up with special codewords for it.  The most
}common is "Hundefelsen 4C."  If you translate "Wolfenstein" into the German
}words that comprise it, you get "Wolfstorm."  "Wolf" is the same word in
}German, and "stein" means "stone" or "rock."  "Hundefelsen" is a combination
}of the German words for "dog" and "wolf," and "felsen" is a synonym for
}"stein."  Hence the alias, "Hundefelsen."

[3.2.3]  Cancelled projects

Frequently, projects that get started never get finished.  This can happen for
a number of reasons.  Legal problems is one common cause; slow progress and
little promise is another.  What follows is a list of projects that, for one
reason or another, never saw the light of day.  Dates are approximations of
the time each game spent under development at Apogee.

}[3.2.4]  Early games by the staff
}
}Before joining Scott and Apogee in 1990, George Broussard had several projects
}of his own.  The most notable were marketed under the name Micro F/X; some of
}these later became the property of Apogee (such as "Pharaoh's Tomb" and
}"Arctic Adventure").  Broussard also made a game for the Amiga, "The Rings
}of ZON," which was like a more intellectual Boulderdash.
}
}Other games written by George Broussard and others were written for Softdisk;
}details for these projects are given in the section on Apogee's relationship

[4.2.3]  Cameos

Frequently, the star of one Apogee game will make a cameo appearance in
another.  Or, sometimes, someone from the real world shows up.  A list of
such cameos follows.  Appearances of Apogee characters in the default
scoreboards of games are not mentioned here, however, since there would be
too many to list.

      WARNING: much of the fun of these games is running across these
      things during play.  Do not read this section if you want to be
      surprised!

[5.2]  The Registered Episodes

The registered versions of the software are the complete versions, and, as
they are not shareware, cannot legally exist on public BBS's or FTP sites.
The registered versions of the software must be purchased directly from Apogee
}or from one of Apogee's dealers.  The best way to get the most recent ordering
}information is by checking the company's web site.  The direct URL to
}ordering information is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/order.html.  The direct
}URL to pricing information is http://www.apogee1.com/misc/prices.html.

[5.2.1]  Ordering information

}To order directly from Apogee, call 1-800-APOGEE1.
}To order directly from 3D Realms, call 1-800-3DREALMS.

The lines are open 24 hours a day.  They'll need to know what disk size you
desire, the best graphics mode you are able to run (CGA, EGA, VGA, SVGA), and
whether you have an XT, 286, 386, 486, or Pentium.  Note that some games have
minimum CPU and graphics requirements.  As of mid 1994, new Apogee games are
}only available on 3 1/2" HD disks and/or CD; older games that were available
}on 5 1/4" HD disks will remain that way.  DD disks will only be shipped if the
entire registered series fits on that disk size.

}Terminal Velocity 1.2 and the registered version of 1.1 were shipped with
}Dwango client software; for other versions of TV, you can obtain the Dwango
}client software by downloading the TVDWANGO.ZIP file from any official Apogee
}area, or simply upgrading to version 1.2.  All versions of Terminal Velocity
}will work with Dwango if it has the client software installed.

[6.2]  Cheating

Apogee has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games, both
documented and undocumented.  Sometimes these cheats are available in all
versions of the game; other times they are only available in the registered
version.  From 1987 to around May 1993, Apogee games came with a hint sheet,
which often contained cheats in them.  From May 1993 to December 1993, Apogee
games were shipped with a XXXXHINT.EXE file, which had the same text as the
old hint sheets.  Beginning in 1994, the XXXXHINT.EXE files are done away
with too; the information is now contained in the actual game manuals.
Sometimes, however, cheats are mentioned in XXXXHELP.EXE files which
previously contained strictly technical support information.

The cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.
The customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or
game manual that comes with the game.  Some of the games also have a debugging
mode, which is not generally documented.  Their original purpose is to aid in
the beta testing of the game.  Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is
left intact, available for the regular game-player to use.  Finally, there are
technical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to
correct some technical problems.

[6.2.1]  Complete cheat list

This section contains a variety of cheats from various Apogee games.
Actually, in the words of Joe Siegler, it's "the first comprehensive cheat
[list] ever published for all Apogee titles."

Note that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by Apogee,
the debug keys are not.  If you use the debug keys, Apogee cannot provide
any support, since this alters game performance to a state where their
standard support comments and issues might not apply.  In short, neither
Apogee or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug
keys.  (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing
happening, save where expressly noted below.)

+ Misc Command Line Parameters - In the registered version, "dopefish" will
                                 cause Scott Miller's "mystical head" to
                                 appear on the main screen to the accompaniment
}                                of "Fish Polka," a musical piece by Lee
}                                Jackson, and belches performed by Joe Siegler.
}                                The menu sounds will be Tom Hall saying "O,"
}                                "K," or "Boy," and the level names will be a
}                                little sillier than usual.

                                 "-screenshots" will enable you to capture
                                 screen shots.  From the game, press [alt] [C]
                                 to save a PCX image.  In version 1.3 of the
                                 game, the "-screenshots" parameter is not
                                 required.

[Boppin]
 
+ Customer Cheat - The following cheats are available:
 
        From the main menu, these are available in both the shareware and
        registered versions of the game:
 
                [ctrl] [V] - gives a slide show of all episodes (while the
                             show is playing, you can hit the left and right
                             arrow keys to go to the previous and next levels,
                             or esc to quit)
                [ctrl] [T] - sound testing dialogue
 
        During gameplay, the following are available in both the shareware and
        registered versions of the game:
 
                [ctrl] [B] - display the mystery spot
                [ctrl] [L] - moves you to the next level, at the expense of
                             a life; will not work during the final battle
        [shift] [ctrl] [L] - moves you back a level; this will not work on
                             either the first level of an episode, or the
                             final battle
 
        During gameplay, the following are available provided the password
        "TOYS" is given to activate them.  These work only in the registered
        version:
 
                [ctrl] [F] - go to the final battle for the episode
                 [alt] [H] - delivers one maximum hit during the final battle
               [ctrl] [F5] - add one credit to player one (nine maximum)
               [ctrl] [F8] - add one credit to player two (nine maximum)
                [1] or [!] - set lives for player one to zero *
                [2] or [ (at) ] - set lives for player two to zero *
 
        * These two cheats may not work if the shift key is used for a button.

        Finally, in v1.1 of Boppin, the command line parameter "blood" may
        be used to access the violence mode from v1.0.


[Wacky Wheels]

+ Customer Cheat - The following command line parameters can be used in
                   both the shareware and registered versions of the game:

          /2       Fast gameplay.
          /3       Really fast gameplay.
          /debug   Create a ERR.LOG file as you play.
          turbo    Activate the turbo key [brake]+[fire].
          jump     Activate the jump key [brake]+[accelerate].

   Additionally, you can specify ONE of the following three weapon parameters:
 
           hog      Get 99 hedgehogs.
           ice      Get 99 ice cubes.
           fire     Get 99 fireballs.

+ Miscellaneous - Hitting [F10] during game play will write the screen out to
                  a PCX file.
                - There is a way to play a track from the registered version of
                  Wacky Wheels in the shareware version, namely, the track
                  featured in the ordering information.  Follow these steps:
                       - start a new game and complete track 1
                       - save the game and quit to the main menu
                       - look at the ordering information
                       - go back to main menu and restore the saved game

+ Misc Command Line Parameter - "now" will start the game directly from the
                                main menu.


[Mystic Towers]

+ Customer Cheat - Cheats are activated by typing "BALDRIC" during a level.
                   Once actived, your score is reset to zero, and you can
                   press the following key combos to achieve what is listed:

   [lshift] R xx - where xx is a number of a room to jump to (01-45)
      [lshift] H - to get maximum health, also food and drink
      [lshift] K - to get all keys except the end tower key
      [lshift] W - to get full weapons
      [lshift] C - to get ten coins

                   Only the health cheat works in the shareware version; the
                   rest require the registered version.


[Hocus Pocus]

+ Customer Cheat - For each of the following codes, type each letter by letter:

        FEELGOOD - full health
           BLAKE - both keys
          BANANA - laser shots (registered version only)
           QUARK - rapid fire (registered version only)


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

+ Customer Cheat - The backspace key will restore all your energy and give
                   you a death ray, at the cost of all your money.  This
                   will only work in the registered version.

+ Debug Mode - Set the environment variable "S_HOST" to the value "CASTLE"
               at the DOS prompt by typing "SET S_HOST=CASTLE" (it must be
               in caps).  Then, when you play Raptor, you become completely
               invincible, and have all the weapons at your disposal.  In
               addition, you can skip levels by starting them, hitting
               [esc], followed by [n]; you'll be returned to the hangar, and
               when you exit again, you'll be on the next level.

+ Warp - There is a level warp built into the game, so you can see any level
         you want at any time.  What you need to do is to get to the screen
         where you see the level selection (Bravo Sector, etc...).  The warp
         combination is a 2 key entry.  The keys are not to be pressed at the
         same time.  Note that you cannot use the level warp unless debug
         mode (see above) is active.

  Key 1 - Z, X, or Y (Z is Episode 1, X is Episode 2, and Y is Episode 3)
  Key 2 - Any key between Q and O on the keyboard.  Q is Level 1, and O is
          Level 9.

  This works in both the shareware and registered versions.  Note that if you
  try and warp to a registered episode from the shareware version, it will
  crash the game.

[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike]

+ Customer Cheat - [J] [A] [M] [Enter] - These keys are to be pressed one at a
                   time.  When all are pressed, the message "Now you're
                   Jammin'" appears, and you will be given all keys, and you
                   will get 100% health.  Your score will also be taken to 0.
                   This will only work on the registered version of the game.

+ Debug Mode - Command Line Parameters

  POWERBALL - Enables debug keys.  This also requires that you hold down the
              left and right shift keys during the JAM Logo intro.  Don't
              hold them down until the white letters start to appear.
              Once the PC-13 screen is loaded, you can let go.  You will hear
              a "ching" sound during the intro when debug mode has been
              successfully enabled.  The "ching" sound will only happen if
              you have a sound card. If you have a PC speaker, you won't hear
              this.
       TICS - Display TIC INFO in score area.
      MUSIC - Enable music test mode: [backspace] [arrows] changes music.
      RADAR - Displays a rotating overhead view during gameplay.  Please note
              that this REALLY slows the game down, to the point of being
              unplayable.

              These cheat keys can be use during gameplay only if you invoked
              the program with the "powerball" parameter:

       [backspace] W - Warp to level ([shift] [W] loads the default map)
       [backspace] D - Player invisible (dumb objects)
       [backspace] G - God mode
       [backspace] I - Item cheat
       [backspace] M - Memory info
       [backspace] P - Pause screen
       [backspace] Q - Fast quit
       [backspace] A - Add Actors to AutoMapper.
       [backspace] U - Unlock all floors
       [backspace] O - Show hidden walls on auto mapper
       [backspace] E - Quick Win Mission
       [backspace] B - Border color
       [backspace] C - Count objects
       [backspace] F - Facing spot
       [backspace] H - Hurt self (only if not in God mode)
       [backspace] S - Slow motion
       [backspace] V - Extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do
                                   nothing for most users)
  [backspace] [home] - Dec sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgup] - Inc sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)
   [backspace] [end] - Dec ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
  [backspace] [pgdn] - Inc ground color (if ground textures are OFF)
       [backspace] + - Add shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] - - Dec shading depth (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] ] - Inc shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [backspace] [ - Dec shading drop off (if textures are OFF)
       [shift] [tab] - Show full automap containing all live actors.

     These cheat keys can be used during gameplay:

           [6] [7] - Collect all bonus items (gold, ammo, health, etc).
           [7] [8] - Kill all actors.
           [6] [8] - Collect all bonus items and kill all actors.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters - These aren't really debug codes, or
       cheats, either.  They're in here for Apogee's Tech Support to use in
       assisting customers who might be having problems running the game.

    VERSION - Display version information.
     SYSTEM - Display system information.
 HIDDENCARD - Disable checking for video card.
     NOJOYS - Disable checking for joysticks.
    NOMOUSE - Disable checking for mouse.
     NOMAIN - Disable checking for main memory.
      NOEMS - Disable checking for EMS memory.
      NOXMS - Disable checking for XMS memory.
       NOAL - Disable checking for Adlib.
       NOSB - Disable checking for Sound Blaster.

        SS3 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT3.
      NO386 - Disable checking for 386.
   ENABLEGP - Enables NoteBook GamePort checking.  (This will do bad things if
                                                    you try it on an Acer.)


[Duke Nukem II]

+ Customer Cheat - For the registered version only, the following two codes
                   can be used during gameplay.  Please note that all three
                   letters have to be pressed at the same time.

  [E] [A] [T] - health is restored to maximum, but score is reset to zero
  [N] [U] [K] - get a random weapon, plus all inventory required to finish
                the current level


[Alien Carnage]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [B] [I] [G] all at the same time will give you
                   full health and jetpack power.

+ Debug Mode - The following debug keys work for version 1.1 of Halloween
               Harry only:

               [ctrl] [R] [E] [N] - Gives you all weapons, and activates
                                    god mode for several seconds.
                        [alt] [L] - Level warp.  Type the number of the
                                    episode (1-4), followed by the number of
                                    the level (1-5).  Illegal input will dump
                                    you to DOS.  This can not be used in the
                                    shareware version to access levels in the
                                    registered version.
                        [alt] [=] - Change location within a level.  Type
                                    coordinates after this code; illegal
                                    input will probably crash the game.

+ Tech Parameter - Pressing these four keys at the same time will show you the
                   coordinates you are at on the level.  This serves no real
                   function on its own, but it is used by Apogee's Game Hint
                   Line sometimes to locate a player in a level.  The keys are
                   [ctrl] [alt] [rshift] [F12]

+ Misc Command Line Parameter - "skip" will start the game directly from the
                                main menu.


[Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [I] [L] [M] all at the same time, will give you
                   both keys, and will give you 100% health.  It will also
                   take your score to zero.  This cheat will work in both the
                   shareware and the registered version.

+ Debug Mode -

  The debug mode is activated with a different command line parameter
  depending on what version of the game you have.

  v1.0  -> -next
           Once in the game, press [ctrl] [tab] [enter] to activate.

  v1.1+ -> -goobers
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Spear -> -debugmode
           Once in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.

  Once activated, these are the keys you can use.

  [tab] [Q] - Quit
  [tab] [W] - Warp to level xx
  [tab] [E] - Exit to next level
  [tab] [T] - Debug info in memory
  [tab] [I] - Free items
  [tab] [O] - Map of level (only works in beta versions of Wolf3D)
  [tab] [S] - Slow motion
  [tab] [F] - Position info
  [tab] [G] - God mode (no damage)
  [tab] [H] - Hurt yourself
  [tab] [X] - Extra stuff (???)
  [tab] [C] - Statistics
  [tab] [V] - Add extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do nothing
                              for most users except maybe increase or decrease
                              the game speed.)
  [tab] [B] - Change border color
  [tab] [M] - Memory map
  [tab] [N] - No clipping (walk through walls)
              (This works only in Wolf3D v1.0 shareware.  This mode can cause
               really bad things to happen to the game, including corrupting
               itself, which is why it was taken out.)

+ Jukebox - Hold down [M] when the game is starting to access a jukebox.  It
            only brings up a few songs at a time; keep on doing this, and
            you'll get a randomly selected list of songs each time.

+ Spear of Destiny only - To get a Gang Screen, choose the window resize
                          option, change the window size, press enter to
                          confirm, then immediately hold down the [I] and [D]
                          keys together.
                        - If you do nothing in the game for 30 seconds, BJ
                          will either cross his eyes or stick his tongue out
                          at you.  It happens quickly, so you have to watch
                          carefully.  You can repeat this as many times as
                          you like.
                        - God mode is accessible in Spear without the use of
                          the -debugmode command line parameter.  Simply hold
                          [tab] [G] [F10] down together to toggle it.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters are the same as in Blake Stone, except
  VERSION, SYSTEM, and ENABLEGP do nothing in Wolf3D.

+ Misc Command Line Parameter - "NOWAIT" will start the game directly from
                                the main menu.

+ Note:  If you press [B] [A] [T] all at once, you'll get a message asking
         why you're trying to cheat, since this is the old Keen Galaxy cheat
         code.


[Bio Menace]

+ Customer Cheat - [C] [A] [T] - During gameplay, you can press these three
                   letters at the same time, and you will receive the machine
                   gun, 99 ammo, & 99 grenades.  This works only in the
                   registered version.

+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters -

            COMP - Turn on SVGA compatibility
            NOAL - Disable Adlib sound card detection
          NOJOYS - Disable joystick detection
         NOMOUSE - Disable mouse detection
      HIDDENCARD - Disable video card detection

+ Other Notes - The following secret weapons are available in both the
                shareware and registered versions:

    Super Plasma Bolt - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit fire; this causes one hit point of damage.
      Fireball Attack - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit fire.
      Electron Shield - Turn left and right 6 or 7 times in succession,
                        then hit the jump key.
  Invincibility Burst - Hold the up arrow until you hear a charge sound,
                        then hit the down arrow.


[Monster Bash]

+ Customer Cheat - In the registered version only, you can press the [Z] and
                   [F10] keys down simultaneously to receive five lives.  Hold
                   down [Z] first; since the [F10] key, by itself, has meaning
                   in the game, the cheat won't work if you push both down at
                   the same time and the [F10] is the first to register.


[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing the [B] [A] [T] keys all at once will give you 99
                   shots, an extra life, and all the gems.  This does not work
                   on early versions of Aliens Ate My Babysitter.

+ Debug Mode - Pressing [A] [2] [enter] all at once will activate debug mode.
               (Early versions of the game do not require this step.)  Once
               activated, these keys will perform the following
               functions:

               [F10] [G] God mode
               [F10] [I] Free items
               [F10] [J] Jump cheat  (Note that you will not be able to jump
                                      down while the jump cheat is activated)
               [F10] [N] No clipping (Be careful.  If you fall off the bottom
                                      of the level, you'll die, even if you
                                      are in God Mode.)
               [F10] [Y] View hidden areas in the level.
               [F10] [B] Set border color (1-15)
               [F10] [C] Show number of active/inactive objects in the level
               [F10] [D] Record a demo
               [F10] [E] End the current level
               [F10] [M] Display memory usage
               [F10] [S] Slow motion
               [F10] [T] Sprite test
               [F10] [V] Add 0-8 VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this
                                       will do nothing for most users)
               [F10] [W] Warp to any level
               [F10] [Y] Reveal hidden areas


[Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons]

+ Customer Cheat - Either of these cheats will work with either the shareware
                   or registered versions of the game.  The key combinations
                   need to be pressed at the same time.

       [C] [T] [space] - Gives pogostick, all keycards, and full ammo.
         [shift] [tab] - Pass through an unplayed level on world map.

+ Debug Mode - [G] [O] [D] - pressing all three of these at the same time
               will put you in god mode, and will give you a "jump cheat,"
               which means when you press "jump," you fly.


[Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [C] [0] [F10] down simultaneously will give you
                   a full health and bombs.  This cheat only works once
                   per game.

+ Debug Mode - Pressing [tab] [del] [F12] at once activates debug mode.  The
               debug keys are:

               [F10] [G] - God mode
               [F10] [W] - Warp
               [F10] [M] - Display memory usage statistics

+ Command Line Parameter - Give "apogee" on the command line when starting
                           up Cosmo.  The effects of this are many.  One,
                           the game will not recognize your old high
                           scores or saved games.  (The high scores will
                           be reset to those of Simpsons' characters until
                           you exit and re-enter the program normally.)
                           In this mode, if you die quickly enough after
                           entering a level, you'll be invincible from then
                           on, to everything but pits on the bottom of
                           each level.


[Duke Nukem]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [backspace] [pgdn] at the same time will give you
                   all keys and full gun power.  This can be used in either
                   the shareware or registered version of the game.

+ Debug Mode - To activate, start up the game with "asp" as a command line
               parameter.  (It must be in lower case.)  Once activated, you
               can press the following key combinations inside the game.
               All keys in each combination must be pressed simultaneously.

               [G] [O] [D] - Full health & all items
               [G] [O] [W] - Level Warp.  This isn't a real warp; it will
                             just take you to the next level.  You need to
                             keep on using it to progress through the levels.


[Major Stryker]

+ Customer Cheat - The cheats here are a bit more complicated than in other
                   games.  There is a two step procedure to active the cheat
                   mode.  (This cheat mode only works in the registered
                   version.  It does nothing in the shareware version.)

                   Step 1 - Type [C] [H] [E] [A] [T] at the Main Title Screen.
                            All keys need to be pressed one at a time.  When
                            you get it, you'll see the message that says
                            "Cheat Active" (it really isn't yet).
                   Step 2 - During the game, hold down the [backspace] key,
                            and then press the [H] & [S] keys at the same
                            time.  When you are successful, you'll see a
                            message that says "Cheat Mode On" (it is now).
                            You can hit these three keys again to turn the
                            cheat mode off.

                  Once activated, you can press these keys to activate various
                  options.  Please note that you must hold down the [tab] key
                  first before pressing the others, or it won't work.

                  [tab] [O] - Fire Options
                  [tab] [R] - Rapid Fire
                  [tab] [S] - Shield Options


[Crystal Caves]

+ Customer Cheat - All keys need to be pressed at the same time:

                   [X] [T] [R] [A] - Gives you max ammo.
                   [N] [E] [X] [T] - Lets you warp to any level.

+ Debug Mode - Pressing [Z] [E] [U] [S] at the same time will put you into
               God mode and will let you activate the other debug mode key,
               which is [G].  Pressing that will reverse the gravity in the
               game.


[Secret Agent]

+ Customer Cheat - Pressing these key combinations at the same time will
                   activate the functions listed.  This will work with either

                   [U] [V] [K] - Gives you 25 ammo.

                   [P] [J] [X] - God Mode
               [B] [O] [N] [D] - Warp


[Math Rescue]

+ Customer Cheat - These cheats will work in either the shareware or the
                   registered versions of the game.  Key combinations have to
                   be pressed at the same time.

                   [E] [L] [M] - Gives you lids and slime.
                   [P] [A] [M] - Level warp.  When you hit this combination,
                                 the game will freeze.  Press a number here,
                                 and you will be taken to that level.  You
                                 will not be able to see the number when you
                                 are typing it.

+ Tech Parameter - Pressing the [+] or [-] keys will speed up or slow down the

                   versions of the game.

                   [L] [Z]  - Warp.  When you type this, the screen will
                              freeze.  Enter the level number you want to go
                              to.  You will not be able to see the number
                              when you are typing it.
                   [P] [S]  - Gives you slime.
                   [Escape] - Will skip the finish of the key sequence.


[Dark Ages]

+ Customer Cheat - Press [F10] to activate the cheat mode in either the
                   shareware or registered versions of the game.  This
                   activates the following cheats:

                   [backspace] - Reduce extra health requirement to 5 coins.
                           [+] - Rapid fire.


[Paganitzu]

+ Customer Cheat - To active the cheat mode, you need to be at the game menu

                   screen where you can enter a number.  The numbers you can
                   enter and their functions are listed below, and they will
                   work with either the shareware or registered versions of
                   the game.

             325 - Gives you 99 lives.
             589 - Goes to the end-game sequence.
             822 - Double point value.
             7xx - Level warp where xx is the level to warp to.

                   time will give you all the keys, the boat, infinite ammo,

[Monuments of Mars]

+ Customer Cheat - To activate the cheat mode, you need to press [capslock],

                   This will work in either the shareware or registered
                   versions of the game.


[The Kroz Series]

+ Customer Cheat - To activate the cheat mode, you need to press either [!]
                   or [X].  This depends on which version you're playing, so
                   you will need to try both to see which works on what you
                   have.  Once activated, you can use these cheats:

     [shift] [9], then [rightarrow] - go to the next level

[6.2.2]  Hex editing

Editing saved game files is one of the finer methods of cheating.  Below are
the specs for the saved game files for some Apogee games.  To make use of
these specs, you'll need a hex editor (an editor, as opposed to a text
editor, which allows you to directly edit a binary file), and a small dose
of know-how.  If you are not comfortable with computers in general, it is
not recommended that you attempt to cheat in this manner; mistakes editing
these saved game files may cause unpredictable results.  Naturally, neither
Apogee nor I take responsibility for any damage caused by manually editing
saved game files.


[Wacky Wheels]

You can edit the WACKY.CFG file to change a number of different things:

      872H - number of laps, in longints (back up three and use those four
             bytes; remember that longints, integers, and words have
             reversed bytes).
      876H - Difficulty level (1=amateur, 2=pro, 3=champ).
      882H - Your points.
      886H - Opponent's points.
      88AH - Opponent's points.
      88EH - Opponent's points.
      892H - Opponent's points.
      896H - Opponent's points.
      89AH - Opponent's points.
      89EH - Opponent's points.
      87AH - Course group (bronze, silver, etc).
      87EH - Course number (1-5).
      8C3H - Number of porcupines.
      957H - Horsepower of your engine (1=12HP, 2=6HP).

      Changing your character type is slightly more complicated.  First,
      edit location 86AH as follows, remembering your old character number.
             0=Uno,   1=Sultan, 2=Morris, 3=Peggles,
             4=Razer, 5=Ringo,  6=Blombo, 7=Tigi
      At location 8A2H should be the number of your old character.
      Somewhere between 8A6H and 8BEH should be your new character number.
      Switch those bytes, so the one with the new character number has the
      old one in it, and your character number has the new number in it.

Note that changing the course group in the shareware version will not permit
access to the registered version course groups, but will instead crash the
game.


[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

With a hex editor, change bytes 27h and 28h of a Raptor saved game file
(char????.fil) to the value FF.  When you load this saved game, you'll have
a few million dollars to spend on equipment.  If you don't have a hex editor,
there are some programs available that do this for you.  The most common
is RapCheat, available in various game cheat archives.

[6.3]  Hints

The following contains some of the most frequently needed hints to various
Apogee games.  In the interest of keeping this FAQ from growing much more than
it already has, it is limited to those hints and clues Apogee is asked for the
most.  This section contains spoilers -- use with caution.

[Commander Keen:  Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter]

The following procedures tell you how to get to the secret levels in episodes
4-6 of the Commander Keen series.  The text was adapted from a procedure
written by Joe Siegler.

Episode 4:  To get to the Pyramid of the Forbidden (the hidden pyramid with
the hand on it), go to the Pyramid of the Moons level, get the yellow crystal
and go to the room that has twelve inchworms in it.  To the left is an open
passageway with some inchworms to the left of it.  All the way to the right of
this bottom room is a door that needs the yellow crystal.  Go through the door
and flip the switch behind it.  The left trapdoor will close over allowing all
the inchworms to gather.

Get the twelve inchworms together in one spot.  When you are near them, they
will follow you; if they are off-screen, they'll lose track of you.  When
the twelve are gathered together, a foot will form above your head.  Jump on
the foot, and it will take you to the hidden pyramid.

While you're in the hidden pyramid, you won't be allowed to play any other
levels until you finish that one.  When the hidden pyramid level is completed,
the foot will be there again.  Jump on it, and you'll be transported to the
outside of the Pyramid of the Moons, and you can continue with your game.
I'll also mention that while you're in the hidden pyramid, you won't
be allowed to play any other levels until you finish that one.  When
you finish the hidden pyramid, the foot will be there again.  Jump on
it, and you'll be transported to the outside of the Pyramid of the
Moons again, and you can continue with your game.

To get outside the Pyramid of the Moons, you need to go all the way to
the left of the room where the inchworms are.  There will be four guns
in the ceiling shooting down.  To the left of them is a hole in the
ceiling you can jump into.  Do that, and there will be a pole in there (that
you can't see) that you can grab onto.  Save your game, since it's easy
to die in here.  Follow the passageway and you'll see a door.  You can
go into that door if you want; there's a free life.  Come back through
and jump into the ceiling above that door, and follow a passageway in
the wall.  You'll come out to a doorway with a bunch of ice cream
cones in front of it.  Go through that door, and you're outside the
pyramid.

However, if you exit this level before going to the hidden pyramid,
you won't be able to get to the hidden pyramid, since this level
(Pyramid of the Moons) will be considered finished, and you won't be
able to get back in.

Episode 5:  Stand in the archway near the end of the level in the "Gravitional
Dampening Hub".  You will not be able to see yourself in there.  You'll need
to do the down jump maneuver, which is holding the down arrow and pressing
jump.  You will fall into the floor below you.  You will then need to walk to
the left, as far as you can go.  Since you will not be able to see yourself,
the only way to know it's working is if the screen starts moving.  If, when
you start moving left, you appear again next to the arch, you didn't do the
down jump maneuver right.

Once you walk to the leftmost part of the level, you'll fall all the way to
the bottom of the level.  Once you stop falling, walk to the right, and you'll
appear again.  SAVE YOUR GAME HERE!   The passageway that you're in leads to
a teleporter, which will take you to the secret level.  There are no more
secrets along the way here, but there is a LOT of stuff that will kill you --
precisely the reason you should have saved your game beforehand.

Also, there is a bug in the secret level of Keen 5.  Once you get there, if
you look around hard enough, you'll find a transistor that you're supposed to
pogo on and break.  Sometimes you'll not be able to break it.  Apogee never
found why this happens.  Sometimes it will work; sometimes it won't.  If you
do break it, the end game story will say that the Shikadi ship blew up;
otherwise, it will say that it got away.

Episode 6:  This is the easiest one of them all.  Right before the final level
of the game, when you're on the world map, you'll see a somewhat large blue
towering thing that looks like a cross between a hut and a mouth.  If you look
beyond it, you'll see a yellow fence.  If you walk through the mouth and out
the other side, you'll come to the fence (don't enter the level; going in the
mouth and pressing space will put you into the level).  Stay on the world map,
and wait there a minute or two.  A spaceship will come around, pick you up,
and will take you to the secret level.  When you're done with the secret
level, wait for the ship again, and it will take you back.  An English
translation of the Galactic Alphabet is in a hidden area in this level.

The solutions to two of the hardest Paganitzu levels, 1-12 and 1-19, follow.

You begin at the point P-11.  First, we'll concentrate on clearing the left
side of the map and getting the 4 keys.  Remove the rubble at K-11, then go
to B-9.  Push the rock at B-8 up one space, then push the rock at D-8 up
one space.  Then move to D-8 and push the rock at C-8 to the left.  The
left side of the map should now look like this:

1    + + + + +

Get the key at C-7, then repeat the same steps for the next set of 3
boulders (i.e. push the rocks at B-5 and D-5 up one space, then push the
rock at C-5 to the left and get the keys.

Notice how this leaves you with 2 usable rocks, now located at D-7 and D-4.
We'll come back to them; now it's time for the right side of the screen.

Prepare by pushing the rock at I-10 up one space, then release the spider
by clearing the rubble at F-11.  Keep out of his way, and as soon as
possible, go stand at H-9, directly to the left of the rock you just pushed
up.  When the spider begins going down the "corridor" of L,M,N,O-9, follow
him with the rock.  Here's what the right side of the screen should look
like:

1   + + + + + + + + +

When you trap the spider at O-9 with the rock, he will explode, turning
himself, the rock at O-8, and the rock you were pushing at N-9 into
diamonds.  Move into the area, and get the diamonds and key.  Notice now
that you have 3 usable rocks available to you, at M-8, N-8, and N-7.

You now have enough rocks to proceed.  Use the 4 rocks from the right side
of the screen, (if you mess anything up, you've got two extra rocks on the
left side) to block the snakes, get the final keys, and exit the level.

        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P

Throughout this message, I'll refer to a trick I'll call "the technique"
which is essentially, pushing a rock from below or from its right side up
to the coordinates I-4, moving yourself to H-4, then pushing the rock to
the right, then down.  "The technique" is useful for getting rocks in a
position where you can push them from its left side.  But more about that
later.  Here we go.

First, avoiding the spider, push the rock at E-6 up one space, then push
the rock at D-8 up and to the right one space (so it ends up at E-7).  Keep
out of the spiders way until he enters the small "nook" area you created at
E-6 - when he does that, push the rock at C-6 in behind him.  The spider,
trapped by the rocks and the pipeline, will explode, turning the rocks and
the pipe into diamonds and opening a passage to the right side of the
screen.

Next, on the right side of the screen, push the rock at I-9 to the left
against the wall, then push the rock at I-8 up to I-4.  Now use "the
technique" to get that rock down to J-7.  So far so good?

Push the rock at J-7 to K-7, so it will be a few spaces directly above
the spears.  Now comes a semi-tricky part.  You must run and push the
rock that is at L-8 to M-8.  If you do it right, the spears will shoot up
and miss you, hitting the rock you left at K-7 earlier.  Now you should be
at L-8, and the rock that was formerly there should be at M-8. (Make sure
didn't push the rock too far -- if it ended up at N-8 or O-8 instead of
M-8, you'll have to start over!)

Now, go down and dissolve the wall at M-11 (just run into it) and get the
key at L-11 (the snake can't attack since the discharged spears are in his
way.  Now, push the rock at M-10 to N-10, then push it up into the water at
N-6.  Next, push the rock at M-8 to N-8, push the rock at M-9 down to M-10
to get it out of your way, then push the rock at N-8 up into the water at
N-5, and push the rock at M-10 up into the water at M-6.

Now you'll need to use the rock at K-7 which the spears hit earlier.  Don't
worry; the spears won't come up any further after you move the rock.
Standing to the right of the rock at K-7, use "the technique" to move the
rock over and up to I-4, over to J-4, then back down to J-7.  Push the rock
over to M-7, then up into the water at M-5.  Finally, push the rock at L-9
up to L-7, then use "the technique" to manipulate it like the others, until
you can push it (from its left side) over to N-7; then push it up to N-4 to
block the snake.

After that, the rest is easy.  Walk up through the gap at M-6 and M-5, grab
the key, head back down, grab the key at O-7 and turn and run QUICKLY before
the spikes hit you (it can be done!), then head for the exit!

[6.4]  Secrets and Other Fun Things

Frequently, game programmers will embed little fun things into their games.
Usually, these things would not crop up under ordinary game play.  Sometimes
it requires doing certain things, typing certain codes, or even activating
the program on a particular day or time.  Sometimes these little things are
called "easter eggs."  Below are some such things that can be found in some
of Apogee's games, and the instructions for getting to them.

}     From Apogee:
}
}[XenoPhage]
}
}In the registered version, type "xacman" at the menu screen to play a subgame
}similar to Pac-Man.
}
}Also in the registered version, there's a way to fight a secret fighter named
}Blarney.  To get him, you need to edit the XPR.INI file with a text editor.
}(Back it up first.)  Change the value for "Player2" to "Blarney" (the line
}should read:  "Player2=Blarney").  Then run the game and select Free Play
}mode.  "Player1" can also be set to Blarney, but this may cause some problems.
}
}If you try this trick to fight Blarney in the shareware version, you'll be
}able to see his picture in the player selection screen, but the game will
}crash when you go to fight him.
}
}Other tricks can be done with the XPR.INI file:  change BloodVolume to 499998
}to get more blood than even the BLOOD cheat code.  Change "Type" in both the
}FPPlayer1 and FPPlayer2 sections to "2" (the joystick) to get your opponent to
}mirror your punches and kicks (but not movement).

[Rise of the Triad]

If you start ROTT when your system clock indicates that it's one of five
different holidays, the "group picture" of the five main characters is
changed slightly.  In addition, on Christmas, the music for the first
level is changed to a familiar Christmas tune.  The holidays and effects
are as follows:

   Easter             <varies>    Lorelei Ni wears Easter Bunny ears.
   Cinco de Mayo       05/05      Ian wears a sombrero.
   Independence Day    07/04      Doug holds an American flag.
   Halloween           10/31      Thi wears a witch's hat.
   Christmas           12/24      Taradino wears a Santa Claus hat; new music
                       12/25      for the first level.

Also, there's a way to get all five "holiday hats" in Rise of the Triad to
show up on the screen at the same time.  If you finish the game the right way,
and destroy all the larvae in the last level, watch ALL the credits (takes
several minutes).  You'll get to a screen that says "The HUNT is victorious.
The End."  Do nothing.  Let it sit there for about a minute or two, and
you'll get another "The End" screen where all five "holiday hats" are shown
at once.

}A second amusing way to start Rise of the Triad is to supply "DOPEFISH" as a
}command line parameter ("ROTT DOPEFISH").  This causes Scott Miller's mystical
}head to appear on the main screen.  Lee Jackson's musical composition "Fish
}Polka" will play.  Joe Siegler will burp.  Tom Hall will say "O," "K," or
}"Boy" as you move around the menu.  And the names of the levels will be a
}little sillier than usual.

In the secret level "Eight Ways To Hell" (episode 3, area 8), designed by
Joe Siegler (a noted and revered Dopefish follower), there's a hidden area
about half way through the level.  It's a long, narrow hallway with
boulders running down the middle and elasto-modes on the sides.  There's
a touchplate at the beginning of the hallway which, when triggered, will
open up a secret room.  The gray walls in the middle of the secret room
spell a message written in the Commander Keen language (see the Keen
secrets section, below).  Look at all the gray walls from all angles, or
use the \MAP cheat (see the cheats section).  Then look at the map to see
the letters.  Translated, it says, "Dopefish Lives!"

Bosses play big roles in Rise of the Triad.  There are four, one at the end
of each episode, and arranged in order of weakest to strongest.  There are
ways to kill two of the bosses that the programmers at Apogee never thought
to try.  These "loopholes" are "fixed" in version 1.3 of ROTT, but version 1.2a
and previous versions still have the loopholes.  For Sebastian "Doyle"
Krist, you can lure him out of the room by hitting the touch plate diagonally
away and to the right of the gold door as you enter it.  The triggering the
touchplate will block the gold door and open a passageway.  Lure Krist
through here carefully, then through the brown door.  Then go up the
staircase!  Krist, in his wheelchair will follow you up.  However, due to
a bug in Krist's programming (he was never intended to ascend stairs), he
won't fall back down to the ground.  He'll fire missiles at you, but if you're
safely beneath him, they won't hit you.  Shoot him until he's dead.  You can
also lure the NME out of the room he starts in, but if he's led into the
}nearby spinblades, the game will crash (this bug, by the way, was *not* fixed
}in ROTT version 1.3, so be careful).

The second loophole involves the final boss, El Oscuro, in his final form
(the snake-like form).  Get a firebomb and an asbestos vest.  Then find
El Oscuro and lure him into a corner.  Keep the corner at your back.  Aim
the firebomb down and fire it -- this will thrust you up into the air.
Land on El Oscuro and wait for him to exhaust himself.  (The intended method
of killing him is to not fire at him at all, but dodge his own attacks until
}he dies of exhaustion.  In all his forms, firing at him simply makes him
}stronger!  Note, however, that El Oscuro can be hurt by the firepits, so
}luring him over those is another technique for doing him in.

It's hard to see, but there's a license plate on the back of the NME (the boss
monster for episode 3 of the registered version).  It looks like a Texas
license plate that says "Spray."  (Spray is the NME's nickname, given by the
}ROTT developement team.)  You can see this graphic at the Apogee web page;
}specifically, at http://www.apogee1.com/catalog/rott/.

Several people have run across the curious message "I'm Free" while playing
ROTT, and don't know what it means.  If you get this, you're probably playing
either the "This Causes An Error" level in the registered version, or you're
playing a user-made level.  The cause of the note is whenever a moving wall
crosses the boundary of a level and just keeps on going.  The game detects the
problem, but, before crashing with a regular error message, manages to put up
the picture saying, "I'm Free" (drawn by Tom Hall).  The "This Causes An
Error" level, originally titled "WanderWall Bug Map," has a pushwall in it
that leaves the level, crashing the game with the "I'm Free" message.
In the rejected ROTT levels (ROTT_REJ.ZIP), there is a level called "This
Causes An Error Too."

What all this is, is a manifestation of in-house humor.  If you don't get it,
that's good, because you're not supposed to.  It's one of those "you had to
be there" things.  At any rate, the story goes...during the development of
ROTT, when a level was tested wherein a pushwall was inadvertantly directed
out of the level bounds, Joe Selinske, former member of Apogee, joked, saying,
"I'm free."  He probably wishes he hadn't, for all the confusion it's caused
customers who have run across it -- either that, or, if he were more like me,
he feels a deep sense of satisfaction in having successfully dumbfounded a
significant enough percentage of the gaming community to warrant mention in
FAQs such as these.

Joe Selinske's response to the above paragraph is quoted below:

Yes, you are right.  I do get deep satisfaction and a lot of laughs thinking
back to when that whole "I'm Free" gag was running around Apogee.  I am the
bastard who started it, Tom [Hall] drew it, Joe [Siegler] scanned it in and
Mark [Dochtermann] put it in the game.  There were so many things going on
during ROTT development that it scares me to think about them.  Wow, that
was some fun.  But way too many inside jokes if you ask me.  ;)

[Wacky Wheels]

To see the Dopefish, a creature from Commander Keen, start any single player
race.  When everybody else moves, stand still.  Hold down the break, and turn
left all the way around until the Dopefish shows up.  Note:  the lion that
starts the race must remain on the screen the entire time; otherwise, the
Dopefish won't appear.  You can do this as many times as you like, so long
as the lion doesn't leave the screen.

}Also, in the shareware version of the game, there are two ways to play the
}track shown in the ordering information of the shareware game, which is
}supposed to be a track available only in the registered version.  One way
}is to play in Championship Mode; you will play that track as a bonus.  The
}sneakier way is to exploit a loophole.  Start a new game, and complete
}track 1.  Save the game, and quit to the main menu.  Now look at the ordering
}information.  Go back to the main menu, restore the saved game, and voila.

[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]

Raptor was written by Cygnus, and it seems to be a birthday present to
themselves.  Whenever Raptor is started when your system's clock matches the
birthday of one of the people at Cygnus, Raptor behaves a little strangely.
Here's the list of recognized birthdays.  You can reset your system clock
to one of these dates manually, if you wish; any year should be all right,
so long as it's not in the past:

                       March 12        Bobby Prince
                       May 16          Scott Host
                       August 28       Rich Fleider
                       October 2       Jim Molinets

Note that in v1.0 of Raptor, Bobby Prince's birthday was not recognized,
while Tim Neveu's was.

What happens is this:  first, the Apogee logo is displayed, but not with
Apogee's trademark music.  Instead, you hear the Cygnus folks, sounding a
little tipsy, humming the Apogee theme music themselves.  In version 1.1 and
1.2, Bobby Prince says, "You boys just don't get it, do ya?" immediately
afterward.  In addition, some of the Raptor levels contain enemies that don't
normally appear such as monkeys who throw coconuts at you, raptor dinosaurs
scurrying across the screen, and cows with machine guns concealed beneath
their hides.  Most of these peculiar enemies appear on the first mission of
the game, and they are usually difficult to kill.

Finally, when you exit the game, you get to hear the member of Cygnus whose
birthday it is give an impersonation of a monkey.  This might consist of
hooting or screeching sounds, or simply an eloquent rendering of the word
"monkey."  (The raucous you hear when monkeys appear during the game are
all the monkey impersonations playing together at random.)

There is a way, beyond setting the system time to a particular birthday, of
getting the monkeys and raptors and cows to fight you.  When the screen comes
up where you must choose a sector to fly, flip the switch at the bottom center
of the screen by clicking on it with the mouse.  It should darken.  This
activates the three lights to the right of this switch.  In version 1.0 of
Raptor, you should turn on the first and third lights; in v1.1 and v1.2 of
Raptor, you should turn all three lights on.  Then you can select a sector or
"auto pilot" and fly the level.  You'll know the cheat worked if you hear a
static-like sound.  All levels have some new enemy that appears by using this
cheat, though sometimes they are small and inconspicuous.  Besides monkeys,
cows, and raptors, there are:  the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship
from Space 1999, pedestrians, a woman sunbathing on a roof, and other
miscellaneous items.

Note, however, that if you activate the "battle cow" mode using the switches,
as opposed to running the game on a Cygnus birthday, you don't get the goofy
Apogee theme song in the beginning, nor the individual monkey impersonation
at the end.

[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!]

In Keen: Galaxy, episode 4, go to the level entitled "Pyramid of the Moons,"
and from there, to the half moons painted on the floor.  If you stand on
these and do nothing for a while, Keen will moon you, instead of his usual
idle activity of reading a book.  This will only happen once per game,
however.

Also, in all episodes of Commander Keen, signs are written in an alien
language.  The comment is made, "too bad you don't know the language."  Well,
now you do.  The language is a simple symbol substitution, the key of which

}[Terminal Velocity]
}
}When you start a new game in the registered CD version, you can get to the
}hidden planet by entering "Terminal" as your name and "Reality" as your
}call sign.  (Both of these are case sensitive.)  Before you start playing
}the hidden planet, a message appears saying you are flying the TV-302, a
}new, experimental ship.  As far as gameplay is concerned, no, you're not
}flying a new ship; this is simply an element of the game's storyline.
}The hidden planet is not in the shareware version or the disk based
}registered version.
}
}Also, in level 3-1 of Terminal Velocity, fly close to the ground near the
}coordinates (63,227).  You will see a photographic image of the Terminal
}Reality team.  If you fly too high, the fog will obstruct the view.  A
}clearer version of this can be found as a GIF file on the Terminal
}Velocity CD in the PREVIEW directory.

[6.5]  Troubleshooting

[6.5.1]  Things to try first

If you have a program with an Apogee game not starting correctly, there are a
few things you can try.  First, make sure your system meets the hardware
requirements of the game.  If they don't, you probably can't run the game
without upgrading your hardware.

Second, make sure you have the most recent version of the game.  Many older
versions of games have bugs that are fixed in the most recent versions.

Third, if there is a XXXXHELP.EXE file that came with the game, read it.
(Most registered Apogee games have such a file on the first game disk;
with shareware versions, you might find it there and possibly in the directory
the game was installed to as well.)  This file will contain numerous common
technical problems with their solutions.

}Fourth, check the Apogee web site.  Common technical support questions and
}their answers are posted there (direct URL:  http://www.apogee1.com/tech/) in
}addition to the contents of the XXXXHELP.EXE files for many games.
}
}If you're running under Windows 95, that may be the problem.  Check the Apogee
}web site for information on booting to DOS when Windows 95 is installed on
}your system (direct URL:  http://www.apogee1.com/tech/multiboot.html).  While
}several Apogee games do run under Windows 95, some don't, and none are
}guaranteed to do so.

If the game is failing to start due to insufficient memory, you can try
removing TSRs, or booting "clean."  With MS-DOS 6.0 or greater, you can do
this by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the system is booting.
This causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be bypassed.  If you
are running a memory manager, try removing the manager altogether; this
seems to fix most problems Apogee games have with EMS/XMS memory.  Additional
suggestions on how to free up memory may be in the XXXXHELP.EXE file.

Also, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some
games, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the
game.  Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.

If you problem is your Soundblaster card (or a Soundblaster emulating card),
then the problem may be the settings on the card or the BLASTER environment
variable.  Check the section on that subject below.

With regard to drive compression, Apogee has tested their entire product
line with Stacker 3.1, Stacker 4.0, and MS-DOS 6.22's DriveSpace.  The
products all worked fine, with the following exceptions:   Monster Bash
suffered a slowdown using DriveSpace.  The install procedure for the Rise
of the Triad CD version 1.2a does not work under any drive compression
program, but the game may be installed manually and will run fine.

If you've tried everything and still can't get an Apogee game to work
correctly, contact Apogee's technical support services.  These are listed
under "Contacting Apogee."

[6.5.2]  Setting the BLASTER environment variable

This section may be useful if you are having problems with sound or music in
an Apogee game.
 
Apogee games that use Sound Blasters look at the BLASTER environment variable
to figure out where to send its sound output.  Check to make sure that you
have the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This code is an example,
and probably isn't exactly what you need to put in your system.
 
NOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of
      cards.  For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE 32.  The
      minimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters.  The other
      three may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.
      Please read this entire section to see if you need any of them.  If you
      are using a clone card, or some card that's not a "true" Sound Blaster,
      then you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3 P330 H6 E620
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |  |_______ AWE 32 Only Parameter
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |    |__________ "High" DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |  |  |  |_______________ MIDI Port
 |    |     |    |  |  |__________________ Type of Card
 |    |     |    |  |_____________________ DMA Channel
 |    |     |    |________________________ Interrupt
 |    |     |_____________________________ Port Address
 |    |___________________________________ Environment Variable
 |________________________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).
If you have a space in there, your system will read the parameter incorrectly,
and it will not be recognized by our games.

Now, these may not (most likely not) be the same for your board, because the
Port Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by adjusting "jumpers" on
your sound board.  Some newer cards have this information controlled by
software, please consult your card's manual for more information on how to set
these things.  You should also check your manual if you are unclear as to how
to tell what settings your card is set at.  The information *IS* important, so
it's recommended that you know precisely what the settings are.  If you are
using a card that "emulates" the Sound Blaster (such as the Gravis UltraSound
through software, or the PAS16), you should check your card's manual on how to
set the card for Sound Blaster emulation.

For PORT ADDRESS, it's almost always 220.  That seems to be the default for
most sound cards out there, and unless you know you've switched it away from
220, it's a safe bet it's still there.

The INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system.  Mystic Towers
and games prior to Raptor require that your IRQ be set at 7 or less.  Apogee
does not recommend using IRQ2, as it causes problems.

The DMA CHANNEL sometimes causes problems if it isn't set to 1, which is the
usual default.  If it is not set to one, some Apogee games may lock up.

The TYPE OF CARD should be 1 if you have an older Sound Blaster, or a Sound
Blaster emulating card.  Use 3 if you have a newer plain Sound Blaster.  Use
2 for an older Sound Blaster Pro.  Use 4 for a newer Sound Blaster Pro.

The MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has
MIDI capabilites.  If so, this is where you define what MIDI port you are
using.  330 seems to be the default, so if you have a MIDI card, and you
haven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably where it still
is.

The HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Sound Blaster 16
cards.  This is not the same as the standard DMA channel, this is a different
one.  This is only used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing
16 bit Sound Blaster sounds.  By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know
that it's something else, it's probably still 5.

The E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative
Labs AWE 32 sound card.  If you have one of these, this parameter will have
been set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the
card.  Check your AWE 32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what
this parameter is used for.

}[6.5.3]  Slowing down your computer to play old games
}
}A great deal of old games do not take the speed of the computer they are
}running on into account.  Hence, when an older game runs on a fast computer,
}it either crashes with a runtime error, or it runs so fast that it's difficult
}or impossible to play.  Either way, this can be fixed by temporarily slowing
}down your computer to a speed where the game will function properly.  A
}simple program can be used to do this.  Apogee recommends "Mo'Slo," which is
}a freeware program available at, among other places, the Apogee FTP site,
}under the filename MOSLO12.ZIP.  (However, "Mo'Slo" is not made nor supported
}by Apogee.)
}
}Some of Apogee's earliest games will require the use of this program on fast
}computers.  These include "Math Rescue," "Word Rescue," "Dark Ages,"
}"Monuments of Mars," "Arctic Adventure," "Pharaoh's Tomb," and "The Kroz
}Series."
