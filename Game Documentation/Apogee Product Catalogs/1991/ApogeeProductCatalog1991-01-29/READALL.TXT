These games won a national programming contest as "Best Games in Shareware".
They feature levels of rousing action, 16-color graphics and a library of 200+
sound effects.  They're a unique combination of arcade, adventure and strategy.

They all have 16-color graphics (yes, 16 colors!) and a tremendous sound
effects library.  In each game you must navigate through dangerous chambers,
solving puzzles and avoiding pitfalls.  Collect gems, whips, chests, nuggets,
tablets, keys and scrolls to aid your progress.  These games are as much
strategic as they are pure arcade fun.

All Kroz games are designed to work correctly on ANY computer system, regardless

of microprocessor type or speed.  Although they are best played on a color
system, they do have an option to be played on a monochrome system!

QUOTES:

"Kingdom of Kroz is the best of all."             -- PC-SIG Directory Guide

"I've had this game a long time, and I still stay up late to play it."
                                                  -- Shareware Magazine

"The most unique and fun-to-play game in shareware!"
                                                  -- Micro Star Catalog

"From Texas author Scott Miller comes an exciting adventure game, Kingdom of
Kroz.  You can use your only weapon, a whip, to dispatch foes and break
through walls.  It's a real challenge."           -- COMPUTE!'s PC Magazine

"1989 in Review -- Best New Programs...Kingdom of Kroz..."  (Kingdom of Kroz
was one of three games listed.)                   -- PsL News, Dec. 1989

"I'm really enjoying KINGDOM OF KROZ, I hope it doesn't destroy my GPA!"
                                                  -- Greg McKinzey, OK

"My computer is held hostage as my wife whips her way to level 25!  You
really DID write an entertaining program,  my check is enclosed for the
two sequels."                                     -- John Rollinson, CA

"Thank you for creating the Kingdom of Kroz series.  They are by far some
of the most interesting and addictive games that I've ever played.  The
shareware concept is a great one.  It allowed me to try out Kroz, a game
that I probably would not have given a second thought to, because the
graphics look so simple and uncomplicated.  What the game lacks in it's
visual appeal, it more than makes up in it's richness and complexity of
play.  Kroz is a real 'thinking [person's]' game."
                                                  -- Vincent Tavedi, MD

The following is a review of the new Kroz games from The Software Labs catalog
of shareware games:

"It's pure dynamite!  A unique combination of arcade action, strategy and
adventure unlike any other game you've played.  Some levels are puzzle oriented,

which makes a great change of pace from the high action parts of the game.
You'll find new terrains, traps, spells, hazards, creatures, and levels to
challenge your dexterity, and sound effects galore.  You'll encounter moving
walls, forbidden forests, active volcanoes, bottomless pits and much more,
plus plenty of options.  AND, no two games will be alike!  Great fun, great
challenge, great action--GREAT GAME!!!"
                                                  -- Software Labs Catalog

The following is an actual letter from a young grandmother who enjoys Kroz:

"I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and was sorry tonight to finally find
the Amulet.

"It really is strange what an illness your game can be.  I have found myself
going over in my head a particularly difficult level right in the middle of a
conversation.  To tell you that I have enjoyed the challenge would be very
understated.

"I am a Grandmother who has traveled around the world, but found no place
that was more interesting than your world of Kroz.

"Please keep my address and drop me a note when you have a new game.  Guess
that about says it all.  Best of everything in the future, I hope that you
become the Agatha Christie of computer games."
                                                  -- Patricia Baker, RI
"P.S. I have died a million deaths!"                (Pat, you're famous!)


"We REALLY enjoy your Kroz games.  We also thank they are a steal at the price
you ask.  Keep up the excellent work!!"           -- Yvonne May, TX

"It's GREAT!.  More challenging and addicting than any other game I've ever
played, commercial games included!  I definately like your style and would
be interested in any more Kroz games you have."   -- Susan Hanna, NH

"As usual, you've outdone yourself with the new features of Lost Adventures
and I'm looking forward (anxiously but quite impatiently) to the next Kroz
game you create."                                 -- Helen Bestafka, NY

"Your new features completely amaze me.  My friend Richard and I have had
many many laughs while playing Kroz.  Everytime we think we have a level 
figured out, up pops something new.  It's just great, so keep up the great
work.  Sincerely hope you continue to make these Kroz games."
                                                  -- John W. Clifford, IN

"I have just completed your amazing game THE LOST ADVENTURES OF KROZ.  The
problem that I now face is that I am not willing to 'go gently into that
good night' of retirement.  I am not content hanging up my whip and sitting
in the rocking chair with my memories.  After completing all seven Kroz
games, I feel as if I'm going through withdrawal without another Kroz fix
to look forward to taking.  Maybe I cound open up a home for old Kroz
Crusaders!

"If there are any Kroz creative juices in your mind, please stimulate them
for just one more game.  Just one more that's all I want, just one more.
Then I can stop, really I can stop, but I want just one more!"
                                                  -- Tonnie A. Hoyle, OH

Dark Ages is the first shareware game to support the Ad Lib and Sound Blaster
music cards.  It features a movie-style soundtrack of eight unique songs and
themes.  It also has sound effects that don't require an Ad Lib (or Sound
Blaster) card to enjoy.

The EGA/VGA graphics are colorful and stunning, with fast scrolling screens
and high-speed animation.  Dark Ages has such demanding graphics and
animation that it requires an 80286 (or 80386) machine to run at proper
speed, otherwise it may run too slowly.  Therefore, Dark Ages may only run on
the newer, faster PCs and compatibles.

In the game, you're the Prince of the Great Kingdom, who as a child watched
your father die at the hands of Garth, a power mad warlord with uncanny
magical abilities.  Garth sent you away from the Great Kingdom to be raised
as a peasant, and to never fulfill your destiny as the future King.

But Garth made a terrible mistake.  The very peasant he choose to raise you
was once the Kingdom's greatest hero, long since retired and forgotten.  And
over the years you were raised as a warrior and as champion of justice, and
the time has come for you to claim your heritage, and free the Great Kingdom
from the dark age of Garth.

"Prince of Destiny" is volume one of the Dark Ages trilogy.  Only part one is
available via shareware distribution, the other two volumes ("The Undead
Kingdom" and "Dungeons of Doom") may only be purchased directly from Apogee
Software Productions (ASP).  Each volume has its own unique appearance, with
different goals, level designs and locations.  Each volume has 10 huge
scrolling levels packed with devious traps, creatures and treasures.

Dark Ages requires 400k free RAM, and an EGA- or VGA-equipped system is
required.  Sorry, CGA is not supported.  Other features include built in
instructions, save and restore, permanent high scores, sound on/off, flexible
keyboard configuration, and three skill levels.  Registered players will also
receive a secret password, which can be used to activate a "child level"
mode, and also an auto-fire mode, so you can hold down the fire key for
continuous shots!

                  Order the Entire Trilogy and Save $15!

Each volume of Dark Ages is $15, or you can order (and register) all three
volumes for just $30.  As an incentive to order all three volumes, you'll
also receive a hint sheet, a cheat mode password, and new bonus games from
ASP.  Plus, you'll be able to call the Dark Ages hints line or mail questions
to ASP for assistance.

Commander Keen is the first truly "commercial quality" game to be distributed
as shareware.  It features ultra high-speed smooth-scrolling EGA graphics and
superb sound effects.  The animation and scrolling is updated at nearly 40
frames per second, for comparison, motion picture quality cartoons are filmed
at only 24 frames per second.

The story of Commander Keen is epic, and in the style of the memorable
matinee serials, like Flash Gordon.  You play the role of Billy Blaze, eight
year-old kid genius who builds an interstellar ship when not working at home
on his college fast-track degree.  Among other household objects, Billy uses
his Nintendo joystick for flight control and his mom's vacuum cleaner
(heavily modified) for his ship's ion propulsion system (with pile height
adjustment).

At the hint of galactic trouble, Billy dons his brother's football helmet and
becomes "Commander Keen"Ädefender of Earth!  Ever on the side of justice,
fairness, and high calorie junk food, Keen dispenses justice with an iron hand.

Keen's first adventure takes you to Mars, where the Vorticon invasion force
is planning their conquest of Earth.  While Keen is exploring Mars the
Vorticons steal pieces of his ship and hide them within their cities.  Can
Keen recover all the pieces and repel the Vorticon invasion?  You'll explore
many dangerous cities, packed with diabolical traps and hideous creatures,
both of Martian and Vorticon origin.  Use your pogo stick to reach high ledges
and jump deadly pits, and use your ray gun to stun the Vorticon invaders. 
Can you find the secret city?

"Marooned on Mars" is volume one of the Commander Keen trilogy.  Only part
one is available via shareware distribution, the other two volumes ("The
Earth Explodes" and "Keen Must Die!") may only be purchased from Apogee
Software Productions (ASP).

EACH VOLUME HAS COMPLETELY UNIQUE GRAPHICS AND ANIMATION!  Volume one is
located on the planet mars.  Volume two takes place on the immense Vorticon
mothership, where you'll need to stop the destruction of Earth by disabling
the eight deadly ray cannons aimed at Earth's greatest cities and wonders.
Volume three takes Keen to the dangerous Vorticon home planet, where you'll
explore huge caves, battle the top Vorticon ninja fighters and discover the
secret of the Grand Intellect.

Commander Keen requires 520k free RAM to run.  Therefore if you have too many
RAM resident (TSR) programs you may have trouble running Commander Keen.  You
may use either a joystick or keyboard to play.  And, of course, an EGA- or
VGA-equipped system is required.  CGA is not supported.

Each volume of Commander Keen is $15, or you can order (and register) all
three volumes for just $30.  As an incentive to order all three volumes,
you'll also receive a hint sheet, a cheat mode password, and new bonus games

Pharaoh's Tomb is an arcade/adventure game set in a huge Egyptian pyramid.
You will need to explore and survive 20 uniquely dangerous levels (screens)
riddled with ingenious puzzles and traps.  This game uses a special animation
system called FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) which allows for
flicker free movement even on the older IBM PC's.

You will start with five lives and a few spears, which can be thrown at
offending denizens that guard the pyramid.  Moving walls, falling spikes,
bats, mummys, and magic winds are just some of the hazards to overcome.  On
each level you will need to collect one or more keys to advance to the next
level.  And hidden on the final level will be the prize of your journey.

Notable features:  No two levels will have the same animated creature
patrolling it, which adds greatly to the variety of the game.  Sound effects
are also used, but can be toggled off. The keyboard controls can be
configured to two alternate sets of keys.  A five player permanent high
score table keeps tracks of the all-time best explorers.  Plus, you can save
the game on any level and restore at any time.

This is the first of four volumes of Pharaoh's Tomb, subtitled "Raiders of
the Lost Tomb"  The other three volumes are:  "Pharaoh's Curse", "Temple of
Terror", and "Nevada's Revenge!".  The volumes should be played in sequence,
since they continue the story to the final encounter.  Each volume is $10, or
order all four for just $25.  All orders must include an extra $2 P&H.  For
registering you will get the newest versions, a hint sheet, and the secret
cheat code.

In the game, NASA has sent several manned missions to explore the mysterious
monuments...but every mission has ended in disaster.  Soon after the
astronauts landed on Mars NASA lost contact with themÄand no one knows why.

You're the final hope.  You have been chosen for a special mission to rescue
the missing astronauts and to discover the secrets of the Martian monuments.
The game begins just after your ship lands on Mars near the site of the
"Cliff", one of the many monuments.  Will you suddenly vanish like the
astronaut explorers before you?  Can you find the entrance to each monument
and discover what secrets are hidden inside?

The Monuments of Mars! is an arcade/adventure game set in the near future as
you explore a secret underground city on Mars.  In the first volume ("First
Contact") you will need to survive 20 unique and challenging levels (screens)
filled with puzzles, traps, creatures and useful artifacts.

This game features great graphics and sound effects, plus a compelling and
fascinating story.  Features include save/restore, high score chart, sound
on/off and keyboard configuration.  Plus, this is the first game to give you
unlimited lives!  You will never see a "Game Over" message in The Monuments
of Mars!, since you simply restart the level whenever you die.  This will let
you concentrate on solving each level without the hassles of constantly
saving and restoring your game.  This is a revolutionary feature that will be
used in many future games by Apogee Software.

SPECIAL NOTE:
> Due to the immense animation requirements of this game, it will not
> function on the original style IBM PCs that use the 8088 microprocessor
> If your computer is equipped with an 8086, 80286 (AT), 80386, or 80486

Contact".  The other three volumes are:  "The Pyramid", "The Fortress", and

T.V. Guide magazine called Star Trek "...the most popular TV series of all
time."  Now we challenge your knowledge of the award winning show with a
series of 10 Star Trek trivia games.  Each volume has 100 multiple choice 
questions, and when you answer a question correctly you'll be rewarded with
a "Bonus Fact".  Bonus Facts are additional tidbits that even further expand
your Star Trek knowledge.

What type of crystal is used to power the engines of the Enterprise?  What
is Mr. Spock's first name?  How fast is warp 2?  What does the Prime 
Directive prevent the crew of the Enterprise from doing?

Did you know that Dr. McCoy's medical instruments were actually modified
salt and pepper shakers.  Or that it was Leonard Nemoy who developed the
idea of Mr. Spock's Vulcan nerve pinch (so as to make Spock less violent).
Or that the Enterprise is 947 feet long.  Or that Joan Collins, Terri Garr,
and Ricardo Montalban all appeared in a Star Trek episode. Or that the
Enterprise was named by Captain James T. Kirks father!

It's all here in Trek Trivia.  You'll also receive a secret code that lets
you answer each question automatically.
