"From Texas author Scott Miller comes an exciting adventure game, Kingdom of
Kroz.  You can use your only weapon, a whip, to dispatch foes and break
through walls.  It's a real challenge."           -- COMPUTE!'s PC Magazine

was one of three games listed.)                   -- PsL News, Dec. 1989

"I'm really enjoying KINGDOM OF KROZ, I hope it doesn't destroy my GPA!"

really DID write an entertaining program,  my check is enclosed for the
two sequels."                                     -- John Rollinson, CA

"Thank you for creating the Kingdom of Kroz series.  They are by far some
of the most interesting and addictive games that I've ever played.  The
shareware concept is a great one.  It allowed me to try out Kroz, a game
that I probably would not have given a second thought to, because the
graphics look so simple and uncomplicated.  What the game lacks in it's
visual appeal, it more than makes up in it's richness and complexity of
play.  Kroz is a real 'thinking [person's]' game."

"I would like to compliment and thank you for your game Kingdom of Kroz.  It
is truly the most enjoyable computer game I have ever used.  Over a year ago
I suffered a heart failure.  A good friend of mine made copies of over 50
diskettes and sent them to me to help during my rehabilitation.  The Kingdom
of Kroz has been my escape from my problems and depression.  When I get on my
feet financially, I intend to order the other Kroz games from you."

effects library.  In each game you must navigate through dangerous chambers,
solving puzzles and avoiding pitfalls.  Collect gems, whips, chests, nuggets,
tablets, keys and scrolls to aid your progress.  These game are as much
strategic as they are pure arcade fun.

All Kroz games are designed to work correctly on ANY computer system, regardless

of microprocessor type or speed.  Although they are best played on a color
system, they do have an option to be played on a monochrome system!

The following is a review of the new Kroz games from The Software Labs catalog
of shareware games:

"It's pure dynamite!  A unique combination of arcade action, strategy and
adventure unlike any other game you've played.  Some levels are puzzle oriented,

which makes a great change of pace from the high action parts of the game.
You'll find new terrains, traps, spells, hazards, creatures, and levels to
challenge your dexterity, and sound effects galore.  You'll encounter moving
walls, forbidden forests, active volcanoes, bottomless pits and much more,
plus plenty of options.  AND, no two games will be alike!  Great fun, great
challenge, great action--GREAT GAME!!!"

not charging by the hour...or I would be bankrupt!.  I am currently

The following is an actual letter from a grandmother of the young age of 64:

"I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and was sorry tonight to finally find
the Amulet.

"It really is strange what an illness your game can be.  I have found myself
going over in my head a particularly difficult level right in the middle of a
conversation.  To tell you that I have enjoyed the challenge would be very
understated.

"I am a Grandmother who has traveled around the world, but found no place
that was more interesting than your world of Kroz.

"Please keep my address and drop me a note when you have a new game.  Guess
that about says it all.  Best of everything in the future, I hope that you
become the Agatha Christie of computer games."
                                                  -- Patricia Baker, RI
"P.S. I have died a million deaths!"


"We REALLY enjoy your Kroz games.  We also thank they are a steal at the price
you ask.  Keep up the excellent work!!"           -- Yvonne May, TX

"It's GREAT!.  More challenging and addicting than any other game I've ever
played, commercial games included!  I definately like your style and would
be interested in any more Kroz games you have."   -- Susan Hanna, NH

"As usual, you've outdone yourself with the new features of Lost Adventures
and I'm looking forward (anxiously but quite impatiently) to the next Kroz
game you create."                                 -- Helen Bestafka, NY

"Your new features completely amaze me.  My friend Richard and I have had
many many laughs while playing Kroz.  Everytime we think we have a level 
figured out, up pops something new.  It's just great, so keep up the great
work.  Sincerely hope you continue to make these Kroz games."

"I have just completed your amazing game THE LOST ADVENTURES OF KROZ.  The
problem that I now face is that I am not willing to 'go gently into that
good night' of retirement.  I am not content hanging up my whip and sitting
in the rocking chair with my memories.  After completing all seven Kroz
games, I feel as if I'm going through withdrawal without another Kroz fix
to look forward to taking.  Maybe I cound open up a home for old Kroz
Crusaders!

"If there are any Kroz creative juices in your mind, please stimulate them
for just one more game.  Just one more that's all I want, just one more.
Then I can stop, really I can stop, but I want just one more!"

Pharaoh's Tomb is an arcade/adventure game set in a huge Egyptian pyramid.
You will need to explore and survive 20 uniquely dangerous levels (screens)
riddled with ingenious puzzles and traps.  This game uses a special animation
system called FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) which allows for
flicker free movement even on the older IBM PC's.

You will start with five lives and a few spears, which can be thrown at
offending denizens that guard the pyramid.  Moving walls, falling spikes,
bats, mummys, and magic winds are just some of the hazards to overcome.  On
each level you will need to collect one or more keys to advance to the next
level.  And hidden on the final level will be the prize of your journey.

Notable features:  No two levels will have the same animated creature
patrolling it, which adds greatly to the variety of the game.  Sound effects
are also used, but can be toggled off. The keyboard controls can be
configured to two alternate sets of keys.  A five player permanent high
score table keeps tracks of the all-time best explorers.  Plus, you can save
the game on any level and restore at any time.

This is the first of four volumes of Pharaoh's Tomb, subtitled "Raiders of
the Lost Tomb"  The other three volumes are:  "Pharaoh's Curse", "Temple of
Terror", and "Nevada's Revenge!".  The volumes should be played in sequence,
since they continue the story to the final encounter.  Each volume is $10, or
order all four for just $25.  All orders must include an extra $2 P&H.  For
registering you will get the newest versions, a hint sheet, and the secret
cheat code.

In the game, NASA has sent several manned missions to explore the mysterious
monuments...but every mission has ended in disaster.  Soon after the
astronauts landed on Mars NASA lost contact with themÄand know one knows why.

You're the final hope.  You have been chosen for a special mission to rescue
the missing astronauts and to discover the secrets of the Martian monuments.
The game begins just after your ship lands on Mars near the site of the
"Cliff", one of the many monuments.  Will you suddenly vanish like the
astronaut explorers before you?  Can you find the entrance to each monument
and discover what secrets are hidden inside?

The Monuments of Mars! is an arcade/adventure game set in the near future as
you explore a secret underground city on Mars.  In the first volume ("First
Contact") you will need to survive 20 unique and challenging levels (screens)
filled with puzzles, traps, creatures and useful artifacts.

This game features great graphics and sound effects, plus a compelling and
fascinating story.  Features include save/restore, high score chart, sound
on/off and keyboard configuration.  Plus, this is the first game to give you
unlimited lives!  You will never see a "Game Over" message in The Monuments
of Mars!, since you simply restart the level whenever you die.  This will let
you concentrate on solving each level without the hassles of constantly
saving and restoring your game.  The is a revolutionary feature that will be
used in many future games by Apogee Software.

SPECIAL NOTE:
> Due to the immense animation requirements of this game, it will not
> function on the original style IBM PCs that use the 8088 microprocessor
> If your computer is equipped with an 8086, 80286 (AT), 80386, or 80486
> then this game will run properly on your computer.  A CGA, EGA or VGA
> graphics card is also required, along with at least 350k RAM.

This is the first of four volumes of The Monuments of Mars!, subtitled "First
Contact".  The other three volumes are:  "The Pyramid", "The Fortress", and
"The Face".  The volumes should be played in sequence, since they continue the
story to a climatic and shocking ending.  Each volume is $10, or order all
four for just $25.  All orders must include an extra $2 shipping, etc.  For
registering you will get the newest versions, a hint sheet, and the special
cheat codes.

Caves of Thor is a brilliant 16 color arcade/graphics game with a 4-way
scrolling playfield. You'll need to explore seven huge levels for the three
Symbols of Virtue:  The Heart Symbol represents courage, the Female Symbol
represents compassion, and the Male Symbol represents strength.  These three
virtues are needed to finish Caves of Thor.

As you explore the empire you must overcome the many creatures that patrol it.
Use your gun (unlimited bullets) to shoot creatures and creature generators.
Other hazards include underground flowing streams (with currents that can drag
you away!), bubbling lava pits and lakes, and the very dangerous Thor Beast,
which creates creatures with devastating speed.

Caves of Thor features the best music yet heard in a shareware game. Several
theme songs are played during your quest, changing to complement the current
situation.  The music in The Thor Trilogy even rates better than most
commercial games!  You have the option to switch off the music, leaving just
sound effects, or you can toggle all sounds off.

Caves of Thor will run in any graphics mode (CGA/EGA/VGA), with 16 color
screens even on CGA systems.  Other notable features include a save/restore
option, easy keyboard controls, a demonstration mode, permanent high score,
and an easy playing cheat mode!

The other two non-shareware volumes in The Thor Trilogy are:  Realm of Thor
and Thor's Revenge.  Both of these games feature more levels, more game
objects and more features than the introductory volume Caves of Thor.  For
example, Realm of Thor introduces the "Max Health Increaser", "Mystery
Objects" and a "Creature Confusion Spell".

You can order each volume of The Thor Trilogy for $10 apiece, or get all
three for only $25.  By getting the entire set you'll also receive the most
up-to-date versions, the Hints and Secrets Sheet, the cheat mode password,
and a free bonus game, usually Apogee Software's newest game release.  The
final volume, Thor's Revenge, wraps up the entire trilogy.

(Special note:  For those players looking for a game similar to the Kroz
 games...this is it.)

T.V. Guide magazine called Star Trek "...the most popular TV series of all
time."  Now we challenge your knowledge of the award winning show with a
series of 10 Star Trek trivia games.  Each volume has 100 multiple choice 
questions, and when you answer a question correctly you'll be rewarded with
a "Bonus Fact".  Bonus Facts are additional tidbits that even further expand
your Star Trek knowledge.

What type of crystal is used to power the engines of the Enterprise?  What
is Mr. Spock's first name?  How fast is warp 2?  What does the Prime 
Directive prevent the crew of the Enterprise from doing?

Did you know that Dr. McCoy's medical instruments were actually modified
salt and pepper shakers.  Or that it was Leonard Nemoy who developed the
idea of Mr. Spock's Vulcan nerve pinch (so as to make Spock less violent).
Or that the Enterprise is 947 feet long.  Or that Joan Collins, Terri Garr,
and Ricardo Montalban all appeared in a Star Trek episode. Or that the
Enterprise was named by Captain James T. Kirks father!

It's all here in Trek Trivia.  You'll also receive a secret code that lets
you answer each question automatically.
