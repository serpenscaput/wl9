THE ANGEL OF DEATH HAS FALLEN...

You were found by Allied forces on a grassy hill a distance from the smoking 
remains of Castle Nuremberg, the Spear clutched in your wounded hands.  A
thin wispy smoke rose off your still body. The grass and earth beneath you 
appeared burned by fire.

In the Allied hospital, you tell no one of your frightening final battle
with the Angel of Death, lest they think you mad.  But you still 
bear the scars of the other great foes of Castle Nuremberg, dark and deadly,
starkly vivid in your memory.

The horrible Trans Grosse, from the family of strong Aryans born of the stuff
of Hitler's dreams.  The heat of his twin chainguns bearing down on you
still chills you.

The stout Barnacle Wilhelm, his thick blue breastplate shining under the
harsh lights of the castle.  He was what he was.

Then the horrible abomination of the Ubermutant, Dr. Schabbs' last curse
on humanity, chaingun built into his chest, four arms wielding butcher's
knives, the depths of Hitler's twisted evil in the flesh.

And the great guardian of the Spear, the Death Knight. Two missile launchers
and two huge chainguns--the battle with him comes back to you as cacophony
and pain.

With the Spear gone, the Third Reich will fall.  May it never rise again.
