þ Rise of the Triad's minimum requirements are a 386DX/40 with 4 megs of total
  memory.  However, Apogee strongly recommends a 486DX2/66 with 8 megs of
  total memory, and a local bus video card.  A fast hard drive will also
  help things a lot.  A sound card is also strongly recommended.

þ For game play the following devices are optionally supported:
  Keyboard, Mouse, Cyberman, Space Player, Gravis GamePad, Logitech Wingman
  Assassin, & virtual reality hardware.

þ The following sound cards/devices are also optionally supported:
  Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, Sound Blaster AWE32,
  WaveBlaster, Adlib, Roland Sound Canvas, Gravis UltraSound, Ensoniq
  SoundScape, Pro Audio Spectrum 16, Logitech SoundMan 16, Disney Sound
  Source, Tandy Sound Source, and any General MIDI device.

If you are installing Rise of the Triad to your hard drive, you can skip this
section. This section only applies if you will be playing from the CD-ROM, and
only you have the registered version. If you have the shareware version, this
section is not for you.

WARNING: Rise of the Triad requires an extremely powerful computer in order
to play the game directly from the CD-ROM.  Our tests at Apogee show that the
game runs somewhat acceptably on a Pentium 90 with 16 meg of ram, a quad speed
CD-ROM, and a CD-ROM buffer of 256k.  A larger CD-ROM buffer will help, but we
still recommend playing directly from your hard drive for better performance.

All the examples in this section will assume that your CD-ROM is your E: drive,
and that you're installing Rise of the Triad to your C: drive.  If this is not
what your system is configured as, please substitute your own drive letters.

In order to play ROTT directly from the CD-ROM, you will need to follow these
steps after installing the minimum required files as indicated from the CD-ROM
installation program.

1) Go to the C:\ROTTCD directory.
2) Set the APOGEECD environment variable to the directory name that you wish
   anything (configuration files, save games) written by ROTT to go.
   (Example: SET APOGEECD=C:\ROTTCD)  See the accompanying ROTT.BAT file
   for instructions and details on how this is used.
3) Go to the E:\ROTTINST directory.
4) Run SETUP.EXE to configure your system parameters, including sound.
5) Run the Save and Play ROTT option to play the game.

The reason the environment variable is necessary is that Rise of the Triad
writes several files (configuration files, save games, etc), and these files
cannot be written to a CD-ROM.  If you do not set this path before attempting
to run Rise of the Triad from the CD-ROM, Rise of the Triad will attempt to
write files to the CD-ROM and will, of course, fail.

The above five steps are made easier if you use the provided ROTT.BAT file.
If you accepted the defaults, this file will be in C:\ROTTCD.  Please examine
this batch file before using it, as it assumes some things about your
system.  If yours is different (it most likely will be), then you will run
into problems if you do not customize the ROTT.BAT file for your system.

þ This game is not designed to be run under MicroSoft Windows.  Windows takes
  up far too many system resources that our programs require for efficient and
  proper operation.  When running this program, DO NOT LAUNCH FROM WINDOWS.
  Run it directly from DOS.  If you are in the Windows environment, quit
  Windows and then run the program.  (NOTE: Using the MS/DOS Icon does not exit
  you from Windows.  That is a shell from Windows. You need to completely close
  down the Program Manager to totally exit from Windows.  To test this, type
  the word exit.  If nothing happens, you are completely out of Windows. If you
  return to Windows, then you were only shelled.)  This would also apply to
  anything like MS-DOS's Dos Shell program, or other menu program, as well as
  Windows, and Windows95.  While Windows95 is better at DOS games, we still
  recommend playing from MS-DOS mode (not a Window) in Windows95 for maximum
  compatibility.  We still officially only support running under MS-DOS.

þ ROTT is a protected mode game, which means that it doesn't really care
  about how much free conventional memory you have.  Instead, it looks at your
  total memory and will use as much as it can allocate.  ROTT requires a
  minimum of 4 megs of free total memory.  Apogee recommends that, for best
  results, you should boot your system as clean as possible regardless of the
  amount of memory your system has.  Please see the "ROTT Detailed Help and
  Troubleshooting" section of this help file for details.

                          ³HOW TO USE THE SETUP PROGRAM³
                          ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

If you want to play a network, modem, or serial game, you must use the
SETUP.EXE program, found in your game's directory.  This setup program will
allow you to launch any of the multi-player games mentioned above, as well as
allow you to select alternate level packs, graphics, and sound (if you have
them), and access other miscellaneous game options.  This section of the
technical help file will explain and show you how to use the options that the
setup program offers.

Here is a brief summary of the options inside the ROTT setup program:

þ MODEM GAME

  This option will let you setup the parameters needed to play ROTT over a
  modem.  When you select this option, you will see a new menu with the
  following items listed:

  ¯ Quick Dial Default Number - This option will dial your default player
                                phone number without having to do anything
                                else.  If you have not set up any phone numbers
                                in the phone book, this will not be highlighted.


  ¯ Number List - This will bring up a screen where you can set up the various
                  phone numbers of your ROTT opponents.  You can use the up
                  and down arrows to scroll around the list.  Press "E" to
                  edit the parameters.  Pressing Space next to an entry will
                  define it as a default. You can only have one default number.
                  Pressing Enter on a selected phone number will dial that
                  number immediately.

  ¯ Manual Dial - This will let you manually enter and dial a phone number
                  that is not set up in your Number List.

  ¯ Wait for Call - This will put your modem into answer mode, so your friend
                    can call you to play.

  ¯ Change Modem Setup - This option will bring up another screen where you
                         can select your modem type from the supplied list of
                         modem strings.  After you select one of the modems,
                         you can then alter the init and hangup strings if you
                         so desire.  The file that these strings is kept in is
                         called MODEM.PCK, and is editable/listable with any
                         standard ASCII file editor/viewer.

  ¯ Change Dial Out Prefix - This option will be useful for people who might
                             need to enter a 9 to reach an outside line to
                             dial on, disable call waiting, etc.

þ NETWORK GAME

  This option will let you play ROTT via an IPX/SPX network.  Please note you
  need to have your IPX/SPX software loaded before picking this option, or the
  network driver will tell you it cannot find an IPX network.  There are two
  ways to play network ROTT.  You can either have one computer dedicated as a
  ROTT "Server", with all players launching the game from standalone "Client"
  systems, or you may have one player's computer act as both Server *and*
  client while all other players launch as Clients.  If you have more than 8
  players, you must have a dedicated server.  Please see the "Setting up an
  IPX/SPX Network Game" section for more information on starting network games.

þ SERIAL GAME

  This option will let you play via a serial (null-modem) cable.  Please make
  sure you have your COM port correctly defined before selecting this option.
  Please note that if you are playing a serial game, both players MUST select
  the same port speed, or the game will not work properly.

þ SETUP COM PORT

  This option will allow you to set up the various options of your COM port
  for modem or serial play.  This must be done before attempting to play either
  a serial or modem game, or you will have problems.  Pressing enter here will
  bring up a submenu of COM port setup options.  They are:

  ¯ Select COM port - This will tell ROTT which com port you are using.  If you
                      are unsure, check your computer's manual for more info.

  ¯ Select IRQ - This will let you alter the default IRQ settings for your COM
                 port.  This can be dangerous, and unless you know you need to
                 alter this, it is a good idea to leave this option alone.

  ¯ Select UART - This will let you alter the COM I/O port that your computer
                  uses to communicate.  A Hexadecimal number is required here.
                  This can be dangerous, and unless you know you need to alter
                  this, it is a good idea to leave this option alone.  This is
                  NOT where you indicate the type of UART chip you have.  The
                  UART chip type cannot be changed from the setup program.

  ¯ Select Port Speed - This option will allow you to select what port speed
                        you wish to open your com port at.  This is not to be
                        confused with a connect rate.  If you run into trouble
                        with modem/serial games, it's probably a good idea to
                        start with a low number and work your way up until you
                        find the fastest rate at which your systems can connect
                        successfully.  Also, the 115200 rate is only available
                        if you have a 16550 or higher serial chip/card.  While
                        8250 and 16450 are supported in v1.1+ it is recommended
                        that you use a 16550, due to the 16550's far larger
                        buffer size.  8250 and 16450 buffers are far smaller,
                        and can cause problems with multi-player ROTT games.

  ¯ Select PULSE/TONE - This option will let you tell ROTT what type of phone
                        you have; pulse or tone.  By default, this is set to
                        tone.  If you only have pulse dialing, this is where
                        you can alter this option.

þ USE MODIFIED STUFF

       ( This option is non-functional in the shareware version of ROTT )

  This option will allow you to play ROTT with various alternate files, from
  new levels, to different sounds and graphics.  Normally, these things are
  kept in the same directory as the ROTT game is, but if you wish to keep these
  files separate from the game itself, you can alter the directory that ROTT
  will look for them in by choosing the "Change Alternate Directories" Option.
  Any of the other options here will allow you to select which alternate file
  you wish to use.  In this example, I will use 'Alternate Game Levels'.  You
  would scroll down to "Choose Alternate Game Levels", and then press enter.
  You will be presented with a list of all the alternate game levels that are
  present in your defined level directory.  You would scroll to the one you
  wish to play, and press the space bar.  A û would appear next to the selected
  file, and it would then be loaded when you played ROTT.  Please note that if
  you select alternate files like this, you MUST run ROTT from the "Run ROTT"
  option.  Alternate level selections are not saved.  If you wish to play with
  alternate files, you will need to select them every time you wish to play
  the game.

þ CHANGE CODENAME

  When you play in multi-player mode, you are given the choice to enter a name
  that you are identified as.  This option in the setup program will let you
  choose a default name so you don't have to keep typing it in every time you
  play a game; whatever you enter here can be overridden when you start the
  game.  This is only here as a convenience.

þ MODIFY MACROS

  When you are in Comm-Bat mode, you can send preset pieces of text to your
  opponents instead of having to type the same message over and over again.
  This is where you set them up.  Use the arrow keys to scroll to the macro
  you wish to edit, and press ENTER.  You can type in your macro here.  Please
  see the section on Comm-Bat play on how to use these in the game.

þ CONFIGURE SOUNDS

  This option will let you set up your sound card for music and sound effects.
  You can alter the volume level for both music and sfx here.

þ RUN ROTT

  This option so incredibly runs Rise of the Triad!

þ This section of the technical help file will cover getting modem play to work
  on your computer.  If you run into problems with modem play and ROTT, please
  read this section first.  PLEASE DO NOT CALL APOGEE'S TECHNICAL SUPPORT VOICE
  LINES FOR ASSISTANCE WITH MODEM PLAY.  It is extremely difficult to diagnose
  modem problems over the voice support lines, and Technical Support does not
  have access to initialization strings and other modem-specific items not
  listed in this file (or in the MODEM.PCK file).  If you need assistance,
  please contact our Online Support Manager via e-mail.  E-Mail contact info is
  at the bottom of this document.

þ This section will make reference to several sections of the setup program.
  If you haven't already done so, please read the section on how to use the
  setup program.  It will make this section a bit less confusing.

þ There are a few global rules that will apply no matter what you do in
  playing ROTT over the modem.  These rules are as follows:

 ¯ You must have a 9600bps modem or higher.
 ¯ When connected to another computer, both sides MUST use the same port speed.  I

 ¯ The init string you are using MUST disable data compression.
 ¯ The init string you are using MUST disable error correction.
 ¯ Make sure you are running from DOS.  Multi-tasking environments such as
   Windows or DesqView are not supported.
 ¯ There is NO Rule #6 (Bruce).
 ¯ This isn't a requirement, but we strongly recommend that you have a 16550
   chip as your serial chip.  Serial ports that use 8250's and 16450's are old,
   and do not have very large buffers, and can cause problems with modem play.
 ¯ This isn't actually a requirement, but we strongly recommend that you do
   this in your init string.  Have your init string monitor the DTR, and if
   dropped, have the modem enter command state.  This will allow ROTT to hang
   up the phone properly.  If you do not do this, ROTT may not be able to
   properly hang up the telephone when it's done.  This command is usually &D1.
   Please consult your modem manual for more information.

þ Please check your modem manual for the proper init strings.  Apogee technical
  support is unable to assist with specific modem string setups.  The reason
  for this is that in order to provide a tested string, we would have to have
  that modem, and since we do not have all modems at Apogee HQ, it is not
  possible for us to provide support on a modem that we do not have. The modems
  we do have are listed in the MODEM.PCK file under "Tested Modem Strings". If
  you find you need to make your own string, please consult your modem's manual
  or contact either the modem manufacturer or the computer vendor or
  manufacturer for assistance.  They will be able to provide much better info
  that Apogee's Tech Support department, since they are intimately familiar
  with their own product.  This goes for any error received during modem or
  serial play.  Virtually all of them are related to a bad modem init
  string.

þ If you have trouble getting your modem working with ROTT, but have been able
  to properly play either Doom or Heretic by id Software with your modem, you
  might wish to try the init string from Doom or Heretic in ROTT.  We've found
  that a lot of Doom modem strings work with Rise of the Triad.

So, you're sitting there saying, "I just want to set up and play!".  OK, here's
a list of the steps you'll need to follow to get ROTT up and running via modem.
Please consult the section on using the setup program for detailed help on how
to do these various things.

1) Type in "setup" to begin.
2) Go to "Setup COM Port" and ensure that the COM port you're using is setup
   properly with the right port speed, and adjust PULSE/TONE, if you need to.
   NOTE: For modem play, it is recommended that both sides open the port at
         the same speed.  If you are playing via serial mode, you MUST have
         both sides opening their ports at the same speed.  Start at 9600, and
         see if it works OK; you can then pick higher speeds if you wish to.
3) Go to "Modem Game" and set up your modem with the Change Modem Setup option.
   If you need to, also change the dial out prefix.
4) Go to the "Number List" & set up all your friends in the dialing directory.
5) If you are going to be called, just go to "Wait for Call".  If you are going
   to be doing the dialing, select someone and call them!
6) Once connected, you're ready to play Comm-Bat ROTT!  Please consult the
   section on Comm-Bat play for details on how to set up the various Comm-Bat
   play options of ROTT.

If you are playing in serial mode, steps one to three are the same, with the
notable difference that you MUST have the same port speed on both computers.
After setting up the first two options for serial play, just go to the
"Serial Game" option on the Main Menu of the setup program and press enter.
Here are some miscellaneous modem tips and information:

þ Remember that you need to pick the same port speed as your opponent for
  serial play.

þ "Live" RemoteRidicule will not work in modem/serial mode.  In order to hook
  a microphone up to the game and be able to talk to your buddies, you will
  need to be playing in network play. The reason for this is that the bandwidth
  required to transmit the voice realtime is too great for modem play, hence it
  is a network only feature. Modem/serial can still use regular RemoteRidicule;
  you can press F1 through F10 during play to invoke a sound on everyone's
  computer!

þ If you have trouble connecting at the higher listed rates, try a lower port
  speed.  These are not actual connect rates, these are port opening speeds.
  We recommend you start at 9600, and then go from there to see what levels of
  port speed you can successfully connect and play at.

þ When you play Rise of the Triad via modem/serial, you will note a line of
  text that reads "UART is a ..."  This will either be 8250 or 16550.  If you
  have an 8250, it means that you have a slow serial chip, and you may be
  prone to modem jerkiness and other game slowdowns.  Apogee strongly
  recommends a 16550 or greater serial chip, since these have larger buffers
  and can deal with the influx of data better.  If you have a 16450, it will
  be detected as an 8250, since a 16450 is virtually identical to an 8250.
  Also, software driven 16550 ports will most likely not be properly detected.
  You will need a "real" 16550 port in order to have it detected as such.

þ If you have an 8250/16450 and experience slowdowns, try these steps to
  speed things up:

  ¯ Make sure you are using 8 Bit Mono sound.  16 Bit Stereo sound sometimes
    makes things go slower on certain system configurations.

  ¯ Try setting the number of voices from 8 down to 4.  If this doesn't help,
    keep trying to lower the number of channels down until you get something
    that is acceptable.

  ¯ Try with all sound and music off.  If it is still slow, then the problem
    lies elsewhere.

  ¯ Make sure the init string you are using is correct for your modem.  Quite
    often, incorrect strings will cause VERY slow game play.

þ Slowdowns during game play can be caused by several things.  It can be your
  modem string, or it can be something simple like a bad phone connection,
  general bad phone lines in your area (or your opponents), or an 8250 chip.

þ If you are the person making the call, you are player one.  You will be
  the "Master", and will be the one choosing the battle parameters and options.

þ If you experience modem flakiness after connecting once, you might wish to
  physically turn your modem off and then back on again.  Some modems do not
  reset properly, or react better if you switch them off and then on again. If
  you have an internal modem, try resetting your system by pressing the reset
  switch on your computer or by powering down, waiting a few seconds, and
  powering back up again.

þ The MODEM.PCK file is a standard ASCII file.  You can edit this as you
  desire, but you must follow the convention that is used in the file.  If you
  alter the file format, you may not be able to pick modems properly.  Please
  see the notes in the MODEM.PCK file for editing information.

þ If you are having problems in serial mode, there isn't much you can do
  about serial connections if they don't work beyond checking for these things..


  ¯ Make sure both sides are at the same port speed.  Use 9600 until you
    are sure it's working.

  ¯ Make sure both sides have the correct com port defined.

  ¯ Make sure you are using a TRUE null modem cable, not a serial cable with a
    null modem adapter.

  ¯ Make sure both sides have a 16550 port (or better).  16450's and 8250's
    can cause problems.

                  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

þ This section of the technical help file will explain how to play ROTT
  over a network that uses the IPX protocol.  If you experience problems
  with network play, please contact our Online Support Manager via e-mail.
  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT APOGEE'S TECHNICAL SUPPORT VOICE LINES, as network
  problems are too complex to resolve via voice.  E-mail contact
  information is provided at the bottom of this document.

þ This section will make reference to several sections of the setup program.
  If you haven't already done so, please read the section on how to use the
  setup program.  It will make this section a bit less confusing.

þ There are a few global rules that will apply no matter what you do in
  playing ROTT over a network.  These rules are as follows:

  ¯ The network has to have IPX/SPX protocols.
  ¯ Make sure you are running from DOS.  Multi-tasking environments such as
    Windows or DesqView are not supported.

Setting up network play is easier than setting up modem or serial mode.  Here
are the steps necessary for getting Comm-Bat IPX play working in ROTT.

1) Make sure your IPX/SPX protocols are loaded on all computers.  The ROTTIPX
   driver will not run without your protocols loaded.
2) Decide which computer will be acting as the ROTT server, and whether this
   computer will be playing or not.  If the server computer will also be
   playing, it should be a fairly powerful computer (we recommend at least a
   486 (not an SX) with at least 8 megs of memory, preferably more.  The reason
   for this is that the server computer will be at a slight disadvantage if
   playing, and more memory or a more powerful computer will help alleviate
   the problem.
3) Figure out how many people are playing.
4) If you are playing multiple games of ROTT on the same network at the same
   time, you will need to make use of the "Change Socket Number" option.
   Please see your network administrator for more info regarding what to put
   here.  This is something specific to your network.
4) Go to the ROTT Server and run the setup program, then go to 'Network game',
   and select "Launch as Server".
5) Enter the number of players and press ENTER.  The ROTT server will then
   wait for the designated number of players to join.
6) If the server computer is to be playing, pick "Client on top of Server."
   If there is a standalone server, pick "Standalone Server".
7) Go to the Client computers, run the setup program, and then select
   "Launch as Client".  Once the server is found, you will see a message
   telling you which player you are.  If the other players are slow getting
   into the game, they will be ridiculed on your computer!
8) At this point, you're ready to play!  Consult the Comm-Bat section on how
   to set up all the various play options of ROTT Comm-Bat play.

Here are some miscellaneous network items to keep in mind:

þ Each player must have a registered copy of Rise of the Triad on their
  computer, or there must be a site-licensed version of ROTT in use.  This
  does not apply if you are using Shareware only.

þ It is not possible to play a network game using a shared copy of the game on
  the network.  Each player must have an installed copy on their local machine.

þ ROTT will not work properly if players are on different LANs that are
  connected together.  Make sure that all players are on the same LAN,
  or you may not be able to play.

þ Live RemoteRidicule will only work in network mode.  Check your microphone
  before you play NetROTT to make sure that it is set up properly.

þ When playing NetROTT, we urge you to not select your network server as the
  ROTT server.  The reason for this is that if someone on your network starts
  making extensive use of your server and doing heavy disk access, you will
  note ROTT slowdowns.  The ROTT server can be any computer, not necessarily
  your network server.

þ Everyone should be at the DOS prompt before launching the ROTT server.
  Once the server is launched, the first person to launch as a client will
  be the "Master", if playing with a standalone server.  If playing with a
  Client on top of a Server, then the server will always be the Master.
  (See the Comm-Bat section for a description of Masters & Clients)  If you
  are playing with a standalone server, this can be overridden with the
  'MASTER' command line parameter.   If this is used, the first person to
  enter into the game with the MASTER command line parameter will become
  master, and any subsequent uses of the MASTER parameter in that game will
  be ignored.  The MASTER parameter will be ignored if you are playing with
  a Client on Top of Server setup.

þ If you get the error "Unknown Packet During Setup" when launching the
  server, it means that someone who was playing a previous game using
  that server is still in the game.  Ensure that everyone has exited and
  is at DOS before starting the server.

þ If you launch as a client, and the server is not found, this means that
  something has become unsynced.  At this point, ensure that every computer
  is at the DOS prompt before launching the server.  It also helps to reboot
  all computers playing ROTT before attempting to play.  If possible, make
  ROTT the first thing you run after rebooting.  This can help in certain
  memory/computer configurations.

þ It is possible to play more than one game on a network at one time. However,
  you can not START more than one game at a time.  In other words, if your
  party wants to play NetROTT, and there is another group playing the game,
  then you will have to wait until all of them are in the game and playing
  before any of the second group can start.  To start another game while one
  is in play, you need to make use of the "Change Socket Number" option in
  the setup program.  Please see your local network administrator for more
  information regarding what to use here.

þ If you are getting an error where the game finds more players then there are
  actually playing, make sure all players are on the same LAN, everyone is
  booted clean, and try a different socket value.

  All players of the game must have the same version number.  In other words,
   If you have 4 players, three of whom have v1.1, and one who has v1.3, ROTT
      will not work.  All players must have the same revision of the game.


One of the strengths of Rise of the Triad is its multi-player options.  There
is a virtual plethora of different options and ways to play multi player ROTT.
This section will explain them to you.  This section assumes that you already
have multi-player up and running.  If you are unsure as to how to set this up,
please consult the MODEM and NETWORK sections of this file for information on
how to set up Multi-Player ROTT.

When playing Comm-Bat, one player is the "Master".  The Master is the person
who determines what level will be played, how long you are going to play, etc.
In modem play, the Master is the person who is making the call.  In network
play, the first person to be found by the server (or the client on top of
server player) will be the person who is "Master".  In serial play, it's less
defined, since the Master is determined by whomever gets the "Player 1" signal
out the line faster.  This is usually the slower computer, but to be quite
honest, the "Master" in serial mode is not an exact science.  All other
players in network play, or Player 2 in Modem/Serial mode are called clients.

NOTE: There is no way to get game enemies in Comm-Bat ROTT.  All Comm-Bat games
      are you against/with your friends, but there is no way to play in what is
      commonly called "Cooperative" mode.

To Start a Comm-Bat game as a Client:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
1) Connect via modem, serial cable, or network using the setup program.
2) Select the code name you wish to use.  If you don't wish to type the
   same name each time, you can enter a default name in the setup program.
3) Select the character and uniform colour you wish to play with.  If you will
   be playing a team game, remember that everyone on the same team must have
   the same colour.
4) You will then need to wait for the Master to select the various options for
   your game.  Once they have selected everything, you will see a screen
   showing the parameters the Master has chosen as the game loads.
5) If you wish to quit a game in progress, press escape.  You will be prompted
   if you want to quit.  Press "Y" to go back to DOS.  The rest of the players
   will continue to play.

To Start a Comm-Bat game as the Master:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 1) Connect via modem, serial cable, or network using the setup program.
 2) From the ROTT Main Menu, select "Comm-Bat Game".
 3) Pick the mode you wish to play (Normal, Hunter, Capture the Triad, etc..)
 4) If you so desire, you can alter the Comm-Bat Options.  This would include
    such things as the score to play to, how long you wish to play, etc.
 5) Select either "Play Game", or "Play Team Game" depending on which you wish
    to play as.  Please note that if you play in Team Mode, all players on the
    same team must select the same uniform colour. The uniform colour is ROTT's
    way of determining who is on what team.
 6) Select the level you wish to play by scrolling down the list of level
    names and pressing enter on the one you want to use.
 7) Enter the code name you wish to use.  If you don't wish to type the same
    name each time, you can enter a default name in the setup program.
 8) Select the character and uniform colour you wish to play with.  Your
    selections will be remembered for the next time you play.
 9) After everyone has selected their options, you will see a screen listing
    all the game parameters for the game you are about to play.  Once you've
    had enough of reading that screen, press any key.
10) If you wish to quit a game in progress, press escape.  You will be prompted
    if you want to quit. Press "Y" to end the game.  Since you are the master,
    everyone's game will end when you quit.

        Special Note: How to play Mixed Versions of Comm-Bat ROTT

If you are playing Rise of the Triad's Comm-Bat mode, we strongly recommend
that all players either have the same type of game (shareware, registered,
CD, or Site License).  It is possible to play one version against another one,
but the process to start will be different.  If you need to play mixed versions
like this, it is recommended that the master computer be the version of the
game that is the lowest.  In other words, if one of the versions is shareware,
then that person should be the master.  This is the easiest way to do it.
If the lowest version is master, then you need to do nothing different.

If you are playing mixed versions, and the Master is not the lowest version,
then the Master must always select the Comm-Bat level set that is on the
lowest computer playing the game.  This is done by selecting the "Use Alternate
Comm-Bat Levels" option in the setup program.  In other words, if you have
three people playing, two of whom have ROTTCD versions, and one who has just
the registered version, the Master MUST select DARKWAR.RTC or an error will
occur.

There are four different Comm-Bat Level Files.  Here is a list of all of them
in order from lowest to highest.

1) HUNTBGIN.RTC -> Comm-Bat Levels for Shareware
2) DARKWAR.RTC  -> Comm-Bat Levels for Registered
3) ROTTCD.RTC   -> Comm-Bat Levels for CD Version of ROTT
4) ROTTSITE.RTC -> Comm-Bat Levels for CD Site License Version of ROTT

Please remember that the easiest way to play Comm-Bat is to make sure
that all players have the same version of ROTT. It will make everyone's life
easier. :)

Comm-Bat Modes
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
There are nine different Modes (or games) you can play in Comm-Bat mode.  Only
three of them are available in shareware.  The other 6 are registered only.
They can all be played in Team mode, except "Tag".  When you play in team mode,
everyone with the same color will be on the same team.  Capture the Triad has
a limit of two teams.  Every other game can have as many teams as you want,
with the exception of TAG, which cannot be played in Team Mode at all.

¯ NORMAL - This is just you and your buddies blasting each other into
           oblivion.  There are no special parameters for this game, and
           everyone is your enemy.  Shoot at will!

¯ SCORE MORE - This is very similar to NORMAL, with one notable exception.
               You get more points for more difficult kills.  The different
               point values you can get are:

               1 point  - Killing an enemy with a missile weapon on the ground.
               2 points - Killing an enemy with a bullet weapon on the ground.
               2 points - Killing an enemy with a missile in the air.
               3 points - Killing an enemy with a bullet in the air.
               4 points - Crushing someone (ie: standing on their head).

¯ COLLECTOR - In this game, the object of the game is to collect more
              "Triads" than your opponent(s). There are small coloured Triads
              scattered throughout the levels, and you need to collect more
              than your friends to win.  There are no weapons in this game.
              This game is very well suited for young children.

¯ SCAVENGER - This is very similar to Collector, except that there are
              weapons in this game.  You can shoot at your opponents as they
              try to get the Triads.

¯ HUNTER - In this game, one player is the "Prey".  This player will be
           unarmed.  It is everyone's job to find that player and kill
           them.  A player is prey for a defined amount of time (this time
           is declared by the Master).  At the end of that time, the
           prey becomes a hunter, and another player is then chosen to be
           the prey.  During play, the Prey will have no weapon on their
           screen.  That picture and screen name of the Prey will be in the
           upper left side of the screen, so that everyone will know who
           the Prey is.  The person with the most amount of points wins the
           game.  If you are playing hunter in team mode, then your entire
           team is "Prey" at the same time.

¯ TAG - In this game, one person at a time is defined as "it".  This player
        is denoted in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  If you are
        "it", it is your job to run up to another player and tag them.
        You tag someone by going up to them and pressing the 'use' key (by
        default, this is the space bar).  Once you tag that person, they
        become "it."  One point gets added to their score, and it becomes
        their responsibility to seek out other players and tag them.  The
        person with the lowest number of points at the end of the game will
        win.  This game cannot be played in team mode.

¯ ELUDER - In this game, you chase roving "Eluders" (they look like small
           coloured Triads - similar to the objects in Collector).  Your object
           is to tag them by running up to them and pressing the 'use' key.
           Each one you tag earns you a point.  The person with the most points
           at the end of the game wins.

¯ DELUDER - Very similar to ELUDER, except that you need to destroy the roving
            "Eluders" instead of tagging them.

¯ CAPTURE THE TRIAD - In this game, you play teams (if there are only two
                      playing, it is two teams of one).  Each team gets a Triad
                      to protect.  It is the object of the other team to steal
                      your Triad from your home base and take it back to their
                      home base.  This is the only mode of ROTT that has to be
                      played in team play.

Comm-Bat Options
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
There are many different options you can select to alter ROTT's Comm-Bat
play.  Here is a description of them.

¯ GRAVITY - You can select Low, Normal, or High.  Normal is pretty Normal.
            Low gravity can make it seem like you're flying, and it will
            take a long time for anything to fall to the ground.  Low gravity
            makes it easier to get objects in the air (including the other
            players in the game).  High gravity makes things fall like a
            rock, and it is very difficult to get objects in the air that are
            in hard to reach places in this mode.

¯ SPEED - You can select either Normal or Fast.  In Fast mode, the players run
          very fast, and it is a bit more difficult to control this way.

¯ AMMO PER WEAPON - You can select One, Normal, or Gunfinity.  In Normal, you
                    have the regular number of shots per weapon.  In One, you
                    only get one shot per weapon, and then the weapon goes
                    away.  In Gunfinity, there are an unlimited number of
                    shots per weapon.  Be warned that Gunfinity makes it very
                    easy for a player to sit in a corner and defend their
                    position, creating a very unfair advantage.

¯ HIT POINTS - You can alter the number of "hit points" per character.   You
               can select one of the options listed, anywhere from 1 to 4,000.
               At one, you take one hit from any weapon, including the pistol,
               and you die.  On the other end of the spectrum, having 4,000
               hit points makes it very difficult to kill someone unless you
               have Gunfinity or God Mode.  You can also select "By Character"
               which means each character has their normal number of hit
               points as defined by their abilities.

¯ RADICAL OPTIONS - These options radically change the game play of Comm-Bat.
                    You can control whether things respawn, and how powerful
                    they are.  Here is a listing of what they are.

   Spawn Dangers - This controls whether you will get items such as firejets,
                   boulders, spinblades, etc.
   Spawn Health  - If you're daring, you can play the level without health.
   Spawn Weapons - This controls whether you want weapons in the level.  If
                   you choose this, there will not be any rocket weapons.
   Spawn Mines   - If you turn this option on, it will turn all the health
                   in a level to mines, which are very painful to run over!
                   (Mines are not in the shareware version of Triad.)
   Respawn Items - This controls whether you want items such as the vests
                   to reappear after they've been picked up/used.
   Weapon Persistence - Normally, when you pick up a weapon, there is none
                        left behind.  If this is switched on, the weapon will
                        still be there after you pick it up.  Furthermore, you
                        cannot drop your weapon (this is done by hitting your
                        'delete' key by default) with this switched on.
   Random Weapons - Normally, a specific weapon will appear in the same place
                    every time.  If you turn this on, there will be different
                    types of weapons appearing each time you play.
   Friendly Fire  - If this is turned on, you will lose points if you kill
                    yourself playing solo, or your team will lose points if
                    anyone on your team kills themselves or another teammate.
                    If this is turned off, then you can kill your own teammates
                    or yourself and you don't lose any points.

¯ LIGHT LEVELS - There are 6 levels of lighting you can choose from.  They are
                 Dark (everything is dark), Normal (as defined by the level
                 designer), Bright (everything is really bright), Fog
                 (everything has a foggy look to it), Periodic (this means the
                 light level pulsates during play), and Lightning.

¯ POINT GOAL - You can choose from a variety of point goals.  You can choose
               1, 5, 11, 21, 50, 100, Random (the computer makes one up),
               Random Blind (the computer makes one up but doesn't tell you),
               and Infinite (play till the cows come home).  If you reach a
               defined point goal before the time you chose expires, your
               game will end.  Also, if you are playing with Random Blind, you
               cannot press TAB to see everyone's Killcounts.

¯ DANGER DAMAGE - You can control how much damage the various hazards in the
                  level cause when you hit them.  You can choose Normal, Low
                  (not much damage at all), or Kill (you instantly die when
                  you hit something).

¯ TIME LIMIT - You can choose how long your game will last in minutes.  You
               can select from 1, 2, 5, 10, 21, 30, 99, and NONE (play till
               the cows come home).  If you reach the selected time limit
               before you reach the point goal you selected, your game will
               end.

During Comm-Bat play, there are some extra features that are not available
when you are playing the game by yourself.  They are:

¯ RemoteRidicule - You can press F1 through F10, and a sound will play on the
                   computers of your opponents (assuming they have sound
                   cards).  Imagine the fun of walking up behind someone who
                   doesn't know you're there, and making his computer say
                   "Behind Ya!", and then whack him in the head with a
                   baseball bat!

¯ Live RemoteRidicule - If you have a Sound Blaster or 100% compatible, you
                        will be able to speak live to all other players in
                        the game by plugging a microphone into your Sound
                        Blaster and pressing F12.  What you say will be
                        transmitted to all the others in the game.  Only one
                        player at a time can use this function.  Please note
                        that this option is only available in network play.

                        Please note that while Live RemoteRidicule can be
                        heard by everyone, you need a Sound Blaster, Sound
                        Blaster Compatible, or Pro Audio Spectrum in order to
                        record (transmit) sounds that everyone else can hear.
                        If you have a sound card that's supported by ROTT, but
                        is not specifically listed here, you will not be able
                        to transmit messages using Live RemoteRidicule.

¯ Messages - You can send text messages to other players, too.  If you want to
             send a message to everyone, depress the "T" key, and then type
             away.  When you're done, press ENTER, and your message will be
             transmitted to everyone.  If you want to send a message to a
             specific person, you need to depress the "Z" key.  After you type
             in your message and press ENTER, you will be shown a list of
             people playing.  You can then select whom you want the message to
             go to.

¯ Macros - If you want to send messages, but you don't want to type the same
           messages over and over again, you can make use of the Macro system.
           Macros are set up in the setup program (see the section on using
           the setup program for more info).  When you're playing, you need
           to press "T" or "Z" like a normal message, but after that, you can
           press ALT-x where x is a number key between 1 and 0 on your keyboard
           for your macros.

¯ Viewing - If you are playing in team mode, you can press the "9" key to look
            through the eyes of your teammates.  Continue pressing "9" to
            scroll through the views of all of your teammates until you return
            to your own.

When you are playing ROTT by yourself, the F5 key will change the detail level,
and the F7 key will turn messages on and off.  These can still be accessed when
playing Comm-Bat rott, but you need to use the Shift key as well.

You can get a lot of crazy bonuses in Rise of the Triad.  It's fun to
discover them on your own, but here are how you get them if you must know.

BONUS                  WHAT IT MEANS
Supercharge Bonus      Got all powerups on level
Adrenaline Bonus       100% Kills
Bleeder Bonus          used all health items on level
Skin of Teeth          ended level with 1 dot of health
Republican Bonus 1     Got all missile weapons on level
Republican Bonus 2     Destroyed all plants on level
Democrat Bonus 1       Never used a handgun on level
Democrat Bonus 2       All shrooms & healing basins used on level

Bonus Bonus            Got all bonuses

It is REALLY hard to get the Bonus Bonus.

There are more bonuses at the end of the whole game in Dark War.  They are
pretty tough to get, too.

Genocide Bonus         Kill every one of the same type of actor in the game.
                       This can be gotten multiple times depending on how many
                       different types of actors you can wipe out.
DIP Bonus              Collect all three developer balls (Hmmmmm....)

þ Apogee strongly recommends that you consult your hardware and software
  manuals for your system before you make any suggested changes to your
  current system setup.  Your manuals will tell you if you are about to
  make changes that may irreparably alter your computer or its
  configuration.  Modifying your system or software can be dangerous if not
  done properly.  Apogee will not be able to assist you with any problems
  resulting from such modifications.

þ If you get the error "Get Static for Index", it means your game data has
  become corrupt.  Run SCANDISK (if you have MS-DOS v6.20 or higher) or
  CHKDSK /F (if you have any other DOS version - see your DOS manual for
  instructions), then delete the game and reinstall.  If the problem persists,
  it's possible your disks have some bad data; obtain another copy.

þ If you get the error message when starting the game that says "WARNING:
  You are running ROTT with very little memory", it means that you do not
  have enough memory available at run time to play the game.  Please see
  the next paragraph for more information on how to alleviate this.

þ If you get an error message that says, "Uh Oh. Memory Problems.", it
  means that you do not have enough free total memory to run Rise of the
  Triad.  This is almost always caused by having such things as memory
  managers (QEMM/EMM386), disk caches (SMARTDRV, Norton Cache), and other
  programs loaded into memory.  These programs are usually loaded when your
  system is first powered up (otherwise known as when you "boot" your
  system).

  The best way around this is to "boot clean."  This means to boot your
  system without loading any unnecessary memory resident programs.  The
  easiest way to do this is to create a bootable floppy disk according to
  the instructions in your DOS manual (see the FORMAT /S command) and
  create a file called CONFIG.SYS and a file called AUTOEXEC.BAT on that
  disk.  Please refer to your DOS manual for instructions on creating these
  files.

  These files should contain the following lines:

   CONFIG.SYS
   ==========
   FILES=30
   BUFFERS=30
   STACKS=9,256
   <if your sound card requires a line in config.sys, put it here>
   <if you use disk compression, make sure to load that driver>
   <if you require a driver to access your hard drive, make sure to use it>

   AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ============
   @echo off
   <your path line>
   <your prompt line>
   MOUSE <if you play with a mouse>
   SET BLASTER=<see section on SET BLASTER for more help on this line>

  The <your path line> and <your prompt line> items in the sample
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file refer to the lines that start with the words PATH and
  PROMPT in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that is on your C:  drive.  These lines
  are optional, but including them will make navigating your hard drive a
  little easier.

  If you have DOS 5, you will need to create a boot disk and make
  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, using the above examples.  If you have
  DOS 6 or higher, you have two ways of booting clean without the need for
  a boot disk.

  For DOS 6 and higher, the fastest way is to reboot your computer and
  watch for a message that says "Starting MS-DOS" (IBM versions will say
  either "Starting PC DOS" or "Starting IBM DOS").  When you see this
  message, press your F8 function key.  You will then be prompted to
  confirm each line of your current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
  This will allow you to temporarily turn off the programs that you do not
  need or that may be causing problems.  ONLY ANSWER "YES" TO THE LINES
  SHOWN ABOVE AND THE "OK to process AUTOEXEC.BAT?"  QUESTION.  When
  finished, you will be left at a plain C:\> prompt.

  NOTE:  Pressing the Left Shift or F5 function key at the "Starting
         MS-DOS" prompt will not work properly.  ROTT requires at least
         30 available "file handles" to operate properly.  This is defined
         by the FILES=30 statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  If you bypass
         your CONFIG.SYS file completely by pressing Left Shift or F5, you
         are stuck with the DOS default of 8 file handles.  You will
         experience errors if you attempt to run the game this way.

  If you are more familiar with DOS, we strongly recommend that you set up
  a multi-boot option.  These newer versions of DOS allow you to set up
  multiple boot configuration sections in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  files, mostly eliminating the need for boot disks.  Again, please consult
  your DOS manual for instructions on how to create a boot disk, or a
  multi-boot configuration using the parameters stated above.

  ROTT is a protected mode program, and it does not require the services of
  such memory managers as QEMM, EMM386, etc.  Please read the section on
  protected mode programs for more information.

þ If your copy of ROTT locks up randomly and you have a sound card, you might
  be experiencing a DMA conflict.  These are caused by having more than one
  hardware device sharing a DMA (Direct Memory Access) channel with your sound
  card.  DMA channels are used by ROTT to send sounds to your sound card.  When
  you have more than one piece of hardware on a single DMA channel, the chip on
  your motherboard that controls DMA transfers may become confused and send the
  sound to the wrong place.  When this happens, your system will lock up.

  Devices that usually cause DMA conflicts include CD-ROM drives, older
  dedicated FAX boards, tape backup drives connected to an accelerator card
  (not including tape drives plugged into your floppy drive controller cable),
  and in newer systems, the ECP/EPP parallel port on your I/O card or on the
  motherboard itself.  If any of these devices are present on your system, they
  may be the source of your lockups.

  DMA conflicts cannot usually be spotted by diagnostic software (e.g., PC
  Tools SI.EXE, Norton Utilities NDIAGS, etc.).  Apogee does not recommend the
  use of such software to determine if you have a DMA conflict.  Instead, if
  you suspect a DMA conflict, try the following test:

       1.  Run the SNDSETUP program and select NONE for your Sound FX card.
       2.  Play ROTT and watch for lockups.

  If the game no longer locks up, then you were definitely experiencing a DMA
  conflict between your sound card and some other device.

  The ONLY way to resolve a DMA conflict is to physically move the conflicting
  device to another DMA channel.  In all but the rarest cases involving devices
  that "download" their configuration at boot-up time, you cannot do this
  through software.  You also cannot solve the problem by simply unloading the
  driver for the conflicting device.  Since this is a true hardware conflict,
  the problem can persist even if the device driver is not loaded when you boot
  your machine. In laymen's terms, booting clean won't solve the problem.  You
  will most likely have to move a "jumper" (see your manuals for a description)
  to physically reconfigure the conflicting device.  If you need assistance
  with reconfiguring your device(s), please consult your system's manuals or
  contact the manufacturer of the device(s) in question.  Apogee Software
  cannot provide assistance for reconfiguring your hardware.

  For best performance, do not move your sound card to a different channel:
  leave it where it is (usually channel 1 for 8-bit cards, or channels 1 and 5
  for 16-bit cards).  Instead, move the conflicting device.  After you have
  resolved the DMA conflict, you may re-run the SNDSETUP program and re-select
  your sound card under the Sound FX setup.

  If your copy of ROTT still locks up, you may wish to check some settings in
  your CMOS configuration as a last resort.  If any of these are on, then
  switch them off:   Hidden Refresh, Hardware Video Shadowing, Turbo Switching.
  Also, if you have either of these, turn them on: HD1 Block Mode; IDE HDD
  Block Mode.

þ If you have a Diamond SpeedStar video card, disable Zero Wait State.

þ If you hear static when you are playing with a Sound Blaster or
  compatible card, make sure to turn the MIC and LINE volumes to zero.
  Your card may be seeing input from these, resulting in static.  For a
  Sound Blaster Pro, the program that adjusts these is called SBP-SET:  see
  your card's manual for precise instructions on how to do this.  If you
  still continue to hear static after doing this, try disconnecting any
  parallel port devices.  IRQ5 and IRQ7, which are used by sound cards, are
  often frequently used by printers as well.  If you have both plugged in,
  the result may be static and poor sound performance.

þ If you are running a Compaq computer with a VGA card and the game tells
  you that you do not have a VGA card, or if you experience lockups on a
  Compaq computer with a VGA card, you will need to contact Compaq for a
  special video driver.  The reason for this is that Compaq has some video
  cards that do not conform to all proper detection methods.  There is a
  device driver available from Compaq that will fix this problem.  The
  driver's name is FINDVGA.SYS.  This file used to be available on their BBS
  with the filename of SP0117.ZIP, but as of the writing of this document,
  it is not available.  Please contact Compaq if you cannot locate the file

þ If you are playing with a joystick, and your performance seems erratic, make
  sure to calibrate the joystick inside the ROTT program.  Also, check and
  make sure that the joystick port you are using for ROTT is speed adjustable.
  If it is, then try tinkering with the speed.  If it is not, then there may
  not be anything you can do to alleviate the problem, short of buying a game
  card that provides speed adjustable game ports.  Check your port's manual for
  more info.  Also, make sure you do not have more than one active joystick
  port on your machine at any time.  If you have a game card that provides two
  game ports, make sure that no other game ports (such as those on a sound card
  or I/O card) are active.

þ If you are having problems with serial or modem play, please see the section
  on modem play in addition to this section.

þ If you are having problems with network play, please see the section on
  network play in addition to this section.

þ Help!  My Space Player is not recognized by ROTT!
  The reason for this is that you must tell ROTT that you have this controller,
  and you're using it.  This is done with the SPACEBALL command line parameter.
  Please see the section on Command Line Parameters for more info.

þ Help! My Cyberman is not recognized by ROTT!
  The reason for this is that you must tell ROTT that you have this controller,
  and you're using it.  This is done with the CYBERMAN parameter.  Please see
  the section on Command Line Parameters for more info.

þ Help! My Wingman Assassin is not recognized by ROTT!
  Yup.  You guessed it.  You need to tell ROTT that you have this type of
  controller, and that you're using it.  This is done with the ASSASSIN command
  line parameter.

þ If you are playing a network game, and you get the message "Invalid packet
  during setup" when launching the server, it means that not everyone has
  quit the game from the previous session.  Make sure everyone is at DOS
  before running the server.

þ If you are playing a network game, and you get the error message "IPX not
  detected", it means that you haven't loaded your IPX protocol.  This will
  need to be loaded before any ROTT programs are run.  Please ensure that the
  IPX protocols are loaded before running the setup program.

þ If you get an error that starts with either "FX SETUP ERROR", "MUSIC
  ERROR", or some other error that has "sound" in the error, it means that
  something is awry with your sound setup.  Delete the SOUND.ROT file in
  your game directory and re-run the SNDSETUP.EXE program that comes with
  ROTT.  Make absolutely sure that you select the proper sound card, since
  an incorrect selection can cause errors.  If this doesn't work, try
  reinstalling the game.

þ If you have a GUS and you are not getting sound effects, or if your GUS
  sound effects are scratchy or distorted, make sure your GF1 IRQ is set to
  7 or lower.  This is controlled by the SET ULTRASND= command in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  A sample of this command line would be:

                        SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,7,5

  The next to last digit on this line (the 7, in this example) is your GF1
  IRQ.  This number must be 7 or less for ROTT to operate properly.  If it
  is higher than 7, you will need to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT and change it
  to 7 or lower.  Save the change, exit your editor, and reboot so that the
  change will take effect.

þ If you get an error that starts with "Z_Malloc", or get "Max Precache
  Reached", it means that you are having memory problems, usually due to a
  lack of memory available for ROTT.  Make sure you are booting without a
  memory manager, or things like disk caches that take up valuable memory
  that ROTT needs to run properly.

þ If you get an error that says "Different number of Pushwalls/Doors/etc when
  trying to load a savegame", it means that either your map data or your save
  game has become corrupt.  Go to the load save game menu, and delete the save
  game in question.  If this doesn't solve the problem, reinstall ROTT.

þ If you are playing a net/serial/modem game, and you get an error that has
  "Player x is unsynced at ...." it means that you had bad packets or otherwise
  had a bad connection.  Quit the game in progress and try again.

þ If you get an error that says "Illegal Load Game Value", it means your save
  game is corrupted.  Either save over it, or delete it.

þ If you have an AWE32 Sound Card, and get the error "MPU-401 Initialization
  Error", you will need to turn your computer totally OFF, wait about 5-10
  seconds, and then turn it back on again.  Delete SOUND.ROT, and try
  reselecting your music/sfx again.  This error is caused by picking incorrect
  settings; if you pick the wrong settings for an AWE32, you need to power
  down and retry, not just reboot.

þ If you have an AWE32 Sound Card, and get the error that the AWE32 card is
  not being detected when you try and select music, do the following steps
  to set up AWE32 music:

  1) Do a full reset of your computer; this means totally powering down, and
     then restarting your computer (just in case the AWE32 is in a bad state).
  2) Set up sound fx by running SNDSETUP.EXE. Do not setup music at this time.
  3) From the DOS prompt, type "EDIT SOUND.ROT". (Or use your favorite text
     editor; SOUND.ROT is an ASCII file)
  4) On line 19, you should see the following: "MusicMode          0".
     Change this to read "MusicMode          5".
  5) On line 76 you will see settings for the Sound Blaster.  They will look
     something like this:

;
; Sound Blaster Settings
SBType             6
SBPort             $220
SBIrq              5
SBDma8             1
SBDma16            5
SBMidi             $330
SBEmu              $0

     On the line that say "SBEmu", change the number that follows from "$0"
     to be the same as the number following the "SBPort" parameter (in this
     case, "$220").  For this example, you would have:

;
; Sound Blaster Settings
SBType             6
SBPort             $220
SBIrq              5
SBDma8             1
SBDma16            5
SBMidi             $330
SBEmu              $220

  6) Save the file and exit to DOS.  ROTT should now be able to detect your
     AWE32 properly.  If you still have trouble, then you may have incorrect
     values for the ports on your sound card.

þ If you notice the game running slowly on your system, here are a few
  suggestions on improving game performance.

  ¯ Disable your disk cache.  Since ROTT does its own internal caching,
    external caches get in the way.  This can result in anything from slow
    performance to complete lockups.  Disk caches also take away memory that
    the game could use to operate more efficiently.

  ¯ Disable your upper memory manager (QEMM, 386Max, EMM386, etc).  Since
    ROTT is a protected mode game, the services of these programs are not
    needed.

  ¯ Turn the option for "Auto Detail Adjust" on.  This will adjust the graphics
    level of the game on the fly, and will attempt to keep the game moving at
    a fast speed all the time.  When you hit a snag, or a possible slowdown,
    ROTT will bump the graphics level down a bit until things speed up again,
    and then will adjust the graphics back up.

  ¯ Try reducing the screen size.  When playing the game, you can press either
    '-' to reduce your screen size, or '+' to increase it.

  ¯ Turn off the ceilings and floors.  This will usually speed things up
    considerably, since the game will not have to draw or keep track of any
    ceiling or floor graphics.

  ¯ Try reducing the amount of digital channels that you have set for sound
    effects.  Some system configurations have problems with having ROTT set
    for higher than 4 digital channels.

  ¯ Try reducing the mixing selection on your sound card from 16 bit to 8
    bit.  This is done from the SNDSETUP.EXE program, under the "SETUP
    SOUND FX" menu item.  8 Bit Mono is the fastest music/sound combination
    there is in ROTT, so if you have slowdown problems, try selecting 8
    Bit Mono.

þ There are a few command line parameters (also known as "switches") you
  can try to use to alter game performance.  Some of these will help speed up
  the game on slow computers, and others help to aid game play.  A command line
  parameter is something that you type on the command line after the name of
  the program you're running.  The 'NOSOUND' switch will be used as an example.
  To use that one, you would need to start the game like this... ROTT NOSOUND

  The command line parameters for ROTT are stackable, which means that you
  can use more than one at a time, if you need to.  An example of a stacked
  set of command line parameters would look like this...

  ROTT NOSOUND CYBERMAN

  Please note that while these are intended for use with the ROTT game, you
  can use them on the setup program.  The setup program will pass any command
  line parameters to the ROTT game that were given to it.

  Here is a list of the command line parameters you can use with ROTT.

  ?                     ¯ Gives you a list of all the common command line
                          parameters used by Rise of the Triad.

  NOSOUND               ¯ This option turns off all sounds (both music and
                          sound effects) for the game, and makes it silent.

  QUIET                 ¯ Disables all displays of text (except error msgs)
                          that would normally occur before the title screen.

  NOJOYS                ¯ This turns off joystick detection.  Useful if you
                          are getting false joystick detection.  Use this if
                          the menus just start scrolling on their own, with
                          no input from you.
  NOMOUSE               ¯ This turns off mouse detection.  If your menus start
                          scrolling on their own, and the NOJOYS parameter
                          didn't fix it, try this instead.  If you still get
                          self-scrolling menus, try using both NOJOYS and
                          NOMOUSE together.

  NOECHO                ¯ Disables reverb/echo sound.

  DEMOEXIT              ¯ Forces the game to exit to DOS if the demo loop is
                          interrupted (by a keypress).

  TEDLEVEL              ¯ Used with Apogee's Internal ROTT Level Editor.  Has
                          no useful function other than for Apogee's use.

  SPACEBALL             ¯ This turns on detection for the Spaceball controller.

  CYBERMAN              ¯ Turns on detection for the Cyberman controller.

  ASSASSIN              ¯ Turns on detection for the Logitech Wingman Assassin.

  ENABLEVR              ¯ Enables driver for virtual reality hardware.  Contact
                          your VR hardware vendor for support.

  TIMELIMIT             ¯ Allows you to play for a certain amount of time
                          with unlimited lives.  Killing enemies and picking
                          up life items adds time to the clock.  (This is for
                          standalone play only.)  If you use this, you MUST
                          also use MAXTIMELIMIT.

  MAXTIMELIMIT          ¯ Sets the maximum time limit you can play, so you can
                          only earn up to this many seconds of time.

  WARP                  ¯ Warps to a specific level number from 1 to whatever.

  DOPEFISH              ¯ When you play ROTT, during the loading screen, the
                          level name is displayed.  If you use this parameter,
                          the level name will be replaced with a silly saying.
                          Other silly things happen during the game, too, but
                          no actual Dopefish appears in the game (Eric Baker).

  FILE                  ¯ This is the name of a user added wad file for ROTT.
                          For example, if you wanted to use a custom wad file
                          named FNORD.WAD, you'd need to type in this...
                          ROTT FILE FNORD.WAD   You can add three such files
                          using this method.

  SOUNDSETUP            ¯ Makes ROTT go through setting up your sound card.

  VER                   ¯ Shows the version of ROTT you are playing.

  SLOWDEATH             ¯ When you die in ROTT, this will let you see your
                          death in slow motion, as opposed to the normal speed
                          it's shown at.

  NOWAIT                ¯ This will bypass all opening cinematics and screens,
                          and will place you at the Main Menu.

  NOW                   ¯ This will bypass all menus and screens, automatically
                          placing you into the game in Level 1 as the default
                          default character and using the default difficulty.

  PAUSE                 ¯ This will bring up a "Press any key to continue"
                          prompt when you first run the game.  This is useful
                          if you need to contact Apogee for help, and they need
                          to ask you a few questions about ROTT and your
                          system.

  NET                   ¯ Tells ROTT that you're playing a multi-player game.
                          This is listed here for completeness' sake, but
                          should never be used.  It's really used by the setup
                          program to pass data to the communication vectors.
                          In other words, the real explanation isn't worth all
                          the time it would take to explain it.  :)

  MAPSTATS              ¯ This will output the map statistics (ie: Number of
                          different walls, doors, etc.) of the current level
                          to the file MAPINFO.TXT.

  TILESTATS             ¯ This will output the tile statistics (ie: Number of
                          different actors, plants, objects, etc) of the
                          current level to the file MAPINFO.TXT.

  LEVELSIZE             ¯ Computes the amount of memory needed to run a
                          particular level.

  IS8250                ¯ This parameter is passed by ROTTSER.EXE.  It will
                          tell ROTT you are playing with an 8250, and in which
                          case, it will turn off the music for modem games.

The final three command line parameters were only used during development, so
we could make sure that the levels we were designing didn't blow up the game!

There are also some command line parameters that are used by the ROTTIPX.EXE
and ROTTSER.EXE programs to control various aspects of modem/serial and network
game play.  They are being provided here for completeness sake.  The incorrect
usage of these can cause problems.  Apogee recommends that you not use these
directly, and start all multi-player games from the setup.exe program provided.
Both sections require the use of the NET command line parameter for them to be
of any use at all.

These parameters relate to ROTTSER.EXE (Serial and Modem play)...

   VECTOR       interrupt vector with which to communicate with ROTT
   ANSWER       answer mode
   DIAL         dial mode
   PAUSE        pause before launching
   STATS        print out run time stats after ROTT returns
   PLAYER       0 - makes you the master
                1 - makes you not the master
                must be used on both systems with different values, to work
                properly

These parameters relate to ROTTIPX.EXE (IPX Network play)...

   VECTOR       interrupt vector with which to communicate with ROTT
   PAUSE        pause before launching
   NODES        number of players in game
   SOCKET       network socket to use
   SERVER       specify this computer to be a server
   STANDALONE   specify this server to be standalone
                else client on top of server
   REMOTERIDICULE turn on RemoteRidicule support
   MASTER       This will force a specific client in Comm-Bat ROTT to be Player
                1 (or the Master).  Only the first use of this in a game will
                be honored.  Any uses beyond the first will be ignored.  If
                this is not used, the first person to launch into a NetROTT
                game will be the Master. (This parameter can cause instability
                in Comm-Bat ROTT.  We recommend against it's use.)

            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

ROTT (and any other Apogee game that uses the Sound Blaster) uses the SET
BLASTER command to figure out where to send its sound output. A Sound Blaster
card can have many different sound outputs, and since there are zillions of
computers out there, a way needs to be used in order to tell the game where
your sound card is located.  The SET BLASTER line is how we do it.  Check to
make sure that you have the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This
code is an example, and isn't exactly what you need to put in your system, make
sure to read the entire explanation of this command.

NOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of
      cards.  For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE32.  The
      minimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters.  The other
      three may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.
      Please read this entire section to see if you need any of them.  If you
      are using a clone card, or some card that's not a "true" Sound Blaster,
      then you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3 P330 H6 E620
|   |       |    |  |  |  |    |  |
|   |       |    |  |  |  |    |  |_______ AWE32 Only Parameter
|   |       |    |  |  |  |    |__________ "High" DMA Channel
|   |       |    |  |  |  |_______________ MIDI Port
|   |       |    |  |  |__________________ Type of Card
|   |       |    |  |_____________________ DMA Channel
|   |       |    |________________________ Interrupt
|   |       |_____________________________ Port Address
|   |_____________________________________ Environment Variable
|_________________________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).
If you have a space in there, your system will read the parameter incorrectly,
and it will not be recognized by our games.

Now, these may not (most likely not) be the same for your board, because the
Port Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by adjusting "jumpers" on
your sound board.  Some newer cards have this information controlled by
software; please consult your card's manual for more information on how to set
these things.  You should also check your manual if you are unclear as to how
to tell what settings your card is set at.  The information *IS* important, so
it's recommended that you know precisely what the settings are.  If you are
using a card that "emulates" the Sound Blaster (such as the Gravis UltraSound
through software, or the PAS16), you should check your card's manual on how to
set the card for Sound Blaster emulation (if your card is not natively
supported by this game).

For PORT ADDRESS, it's almost always 220.  That seems to be the default for
most sound cards out there, and unless you know you've switched it away from
220, it's a safe bet it's still there.

The INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system.  Apogee does
not recommend using IRQ2.  Most of the people we run into who use IRQ2 have
difficulty getting their programs to run properly, unless they switch to a
different IRQ channel.  If you are using a Gravis UltraSound, you must have
an IRQ of 7 or less.  The Apogee Sound System used in this game does not
support the GUS default of 11.

The DMA CHANNEL is one that causes some people problems.  By default, this is
almost always set at 1.  Unless you have a specific need to change this, it's
probably still at 1.  If you're running into lockups using digitized sounds
with Apogee games, this is probably where your problem lies.  Please see the
"ROTT Detailed Help and Troubleshooting" section of this document for further
information if you have problems.

The TYPE OF CARD is something that is fairly easy to check out.  If you're
running a non-Creative Labs sound card, then you want this to either be 1 or 3,
depending on which card it is.  In the majority of cases, it will be a 1 if
you are not using a "true" Sound Blaster.  If you do have a "true" Sound
Blaster, then the variable is one of these...

   1 or 3 for a plain Sound Blaster.
   2 or 4 for a Sound Blaster Pro, or
   6 for a Sound Blaster 16 or an AWE32.

The factor in choosing between the two numbers here is the age of the card.  If
it's an older card, than choose the smaller number (1 or 2).  Clone cards, or
cards that emulate the Sound Blaster usually have a T value of 1. Experiment to
see what works best for you.

The MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has
MIDI capabilities.  If so, this is where you define what MIDI port you are
using.  330 seems to be the default for most cards, so if you have a MIDI card,
and you haven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably where
it still is.

The HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Sound Blaster 16
cards.  This is not the same as the standard DMA channel, this is a different
one.  This is only used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing
16 bit Sound Blaster sounds.  By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know
that it's something else, it's probably still 5.

The E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative
Labs AWE32 sound card.  If you have one of these, this parameter will have been
set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the card.
Check your AWE32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what this
paramter is used for.

I get a lot of questions from people wanting to know why they have to use this
if they don't have a Sound Blaster.  Well, it's simple.  This command has
NOTHING to do with what type of sound card you have.  Apogee games that use
digitized sounds expect these cards to be at specific settings.  If they are
not, then the game needs to be told this.  The way to do this is with the
environment variable BLASTER.  That's why this is needed.  Some of our newer
programs (ROTT, Hocus Pocus) have specific setup programs which let you set
up this information manually, but they still require the SET BLASTER line to
operate at 100% efficiency.
Please remember to add this to AUTOEXEC.BAT, save the file back to disk,
reboot your computer, and make sure to delete the game's sound config file
(SOUND.ROT) before running again.  If you have any further questions, please
drop Apogee a line.

IMPORTANT: Music and Sound FX do not work under OS/2 with this release of Rise
of the Triad.  If you have a sound card, do not run the SNDSETUP.EXE program
that comes with the game under an OS/2 DOS session.  Also, do not select
"Configure Sounds" from the SETUP.EXE menu under an OS/2 DOS session.  Music
and Sound FX are turned off by default: attempting to enable them (or disable
them: see below) under OS/2 will most likely cause the DOS session to crash.

If you play the game under true DOS through a Dual Boot or Boot Manager
environment and you enable the Music and Sound FX while under DOS, you will
need to disable both through the SNDSETUP.EXE program while still in native
DOS if you intend to reboot under OS/2 and run the game from a program
reference object.  Once the Music and Sound FX have been enabled, any attempt
to disable them from an OS/2 DOS session will result in the same type of
crash mentioned above.

**** Setting up the Settings ****

Create a program reference object for the ROTT.EXE program.  If you plan on
playing the modem, network, or serial games, set up an object for the SETUP.EXE
program as well.  The single player game can be run from an object for either
program, but the modem, network, and serial games can only be started from an
object for SETUP.EXE.

For each object you create, open the settings notebook to the Session page and
click on the "DOS Full Screen" button.  On that same page, click on the "DOS
Settings" bar and make sure that the following settings are present:

NOTES:  The above settings have been tested under OS/2 2.1 GA with the OS/2
2.11 Service Pack, as well as OS/2 Warp v3 "Fullpack" (with WIN-OS/2 code
built-in).  The game has not been tested under OS/2 for Windows or OS/2 Warp v3
for Windows (i.e., without built-in WIN-OS/2 code), but it should function the
same under either of these.

We were not able to test modem or network play under OS/2.  However, we did
test serial play via a direct link under the settings shown above. If you have
problems with either serial or modem play, you may wish to obtain a copy of
Ray Gwinn's SIO/VSIO communication drivers.  These are available from most BBS
systems and in the OS2SHARE forum on CompuServe.  As of this writing, the most
current release is usually found as SIO150.ZIP.

If you have any suggestions for network play settings, please send them to us
by mail, fax, or e-mail.  We would appreciate any input you could offer.

These settings are not officially supported by Apogee.  Your mileage may vary.

Apogee has included a cheat mode in Rise of the Triad.  In order to activate
it, you need to be playing the game. Type in the word "DIPSTICK".  After that,
you can type other words to activate various cheats.  A few are:

CHOJIN     - 'Woundless with Weapons' (You can't be killed, and when you fire
              a missile weapon, your number of shots left stays the same.)

RIDE       - 'Missile Cam' (When you fire a missile, or any other projectile,
              your point of view will be at the front of the projectile until
              it hits a target, and then your point of view is back to normal.)

CARTIER    - 'Map' (Shows the entire level map)

GOTO       - 'Warp Menu' (Shows a menu of all available levels and allows
              you to select one to go to)

NOTE: If you have the registered version, and warp to the level "This Causes
      An Error", don't panic! This does not mean your game is bad, or you have
      a virus or something.  This was just something that amused the ROTT
      developers, and was left in as a gag.

There are tons of other cheat codes that work with ROTT.  See if you can
figure them out!

                            ³WHAT IS PROTECTED MODE?³
                            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

As promised earlier in this document, here is an explanation of Protected mode.
This information is not necessary to get the game running, but it's included as
background information for the curious.

Historically, DOS programs have always required that you run them in the first
640k of ram.  This was a limitation imposed on DOS back when v1.0 was the only
thing around.  For compatibility's sake, this is the way things have remained.
Any memory above 640k could only be used for data storage, not for program
execution.  That's why you always saw those dreaded "Out of Memory" messages.

As time went on, certain programs, (and later DOS itself) gained the ability to
load part of themselves "high", leaving more conventional (the first 640k) of
memory available.  You still had the limitation of the 640k barrier, but some
more breathing room was made by these memory advances.

More recently, advances were made in memory management so that programs could
run in protected mode.  Protected mode is a special way of programming so that
your program doesn't have the 640k barrier.  Depending on how the program is
written, the entire thing is in protected mode, or it requires the use of a DOS
"Extender" to run that way.  ROTT is such a program.  ROTT uses a DOS extender
to access much more memory than it would have been able to if it were written
the old way.  A game of this complexity would have never been able to have been
written if the old 640k barrier method of programming was used.

Well, you might be asking, what about my older programs?  Can't I just use a
DOS extender, and have that run something like "Wolfenstein 3D", and never get
those out of memory errors?  Well, it's not as simple as that.  If a program is
using a DOS extender, it has to be written a special way.  A DOS extender isn't
just a magic wand that you can use to wipe away your memory problems for
non-protected mode programs.  The program has to be written a special way to
make use of the DOS extender.

To summarize, Protected mode (sometimes referred to as "flat memory") is a way
for a DOS program (either by itself, or through the use of a DOS extender) to
access more than just the first 640k of memory for program execution.  Because
of this, more complex programs (such as ROTT) are able to be written.  If
using the old 640k barrier method (sometimes referred to as "segmented
memory"), this type of program would not have been possible.

If you're still confused, don't worry about it.  As I said above, this
information is not necessary for the proper play of ROTT.  It's in here for
background information only.  If you're still inclined, check out some DOS
programming books available at your library or a book store.  They have far
more verbose explanations of this than would be possible in this document.

and have it ready for assistance.  If you can't be at your computer, please
have printouts of the following things available, so that we may assist you
better.  It may be possible to provide technical support without these things,
but it will be much more difficult.

Please have printouts of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files when you call.
Also, have a printout of what you get when you execute the "MEM /C" command (or
just the MEM command if you get an error using MEM /C).  We will also need as
much information on the devices installed in your system as you can gather.
This includes lists of the devices, brand names and models, hardware interrupts
they use, DMA channels they use, and the base addresses at which they are
installed.  Finally, we will need to know what version of DOS you are running.
If you are not sure, type VER at any DOS prompt and write down or print out
what you get.

                       THE DEVELOPERS OF INCREDIBLE POWER
We got our name from a memo of Tom's about work hours.  At the end, it read:
[some text about working together well, and if we do...] We will be...
The Developers of Incredible Power!  It kind of stuck after that.  We don't
mean it to be bragging--we mean it to have a sense of humor about ourselves.
So many companies take themselves so bloody seriously all the time.
Anyway, here we are....

Joe Selinske       He did a bunch of battle levels and some game levels, also
                   spent too much time eating sushi and watching Japanimation.
                   Later went on to wear very silly hats with horns on them.
Joe Siegler        He did some game levels, including several that really make
                   people mad like "The Vomitorium".  Drinks Diet Coke like
                   most people inhale air.  Also wrote this file you're reading
                   right now!

               These folks have left the Developers of Incredible
                     Power, but left their mark on the game

Tim Neveu          He drew many cinematic screens, the weapons, and the menu
                   pictures.  Dreams of working for the Moon Pie people.
Nolan Martin       He programmed most of the menus and the setup program,
                   and loved donuts.
