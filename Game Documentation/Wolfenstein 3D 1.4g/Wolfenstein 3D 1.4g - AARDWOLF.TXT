At a point during the game Wolfenstein-3D, you may see a sign in a room
that says, "Call Apogee - Say 'AARDWOLF'".  Please do not call.  The
"AARDWOLF" sign and the maze it is located in were to be part of a contest
that Apogee was forced to cancel before it could be announced, so you will
save yourself some long-distance phone charges if you do not call. 

Also, you might find yourself locked inside a room in the maze once you
have found this sign (located in Episode 2, Level 8).  The only way out in
this situation is to restore a saved game at a point prior to where you
were locked in.  Also, it is not possible to get 100% of the secrets on
this level.  For these reasons, Apogee Software does not recommend that
you try to complete the maze, unless you want the challenge of mapping it
yourself.  Apogee does not provide support on completing the maze, so be
sure to save your game often if you try!

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause, and we hope that
you enjoy your game!
