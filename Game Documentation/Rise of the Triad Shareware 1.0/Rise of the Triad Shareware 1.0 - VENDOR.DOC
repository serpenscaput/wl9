FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS TO ROTT VERSION 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note:  The following problems should be fixed in the next released version
of ROTT, which should be available on-line by February 1995.

[1] This version of ROTT does not properly support COM cards equipped with
    the 8250 UART chip (it works, but not to our satisfaction yet).

[2] You'll be able to play network ROTT games with needing a separate,
    dedicated computer acting as the server.

[3] The entire game will be better tweaked and fine-tuned.  We released
    this version ASAP to get it out before Christmas (due to intense
    pressure by the public), and we feel like we were not able to fully
    and properly play-test the game, and make minute finishing touches.
