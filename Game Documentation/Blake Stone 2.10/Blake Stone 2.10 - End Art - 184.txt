Bloody good work, Blake! You've severely crippled Goldfire's legion of mutants and 
destroyed the first of his dreaded guardian aliens. You've removed the threat of 
Goldfire's forceful grip on Selon ensuring its peaceful existance.

With the fall of the STAR Institute, Goldfire has accelerated his plans to unleash 
the legions of killer mutants and is fortifying his defenses against any further 
attacks.
