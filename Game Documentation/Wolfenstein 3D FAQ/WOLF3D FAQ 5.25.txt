0.2 FOREWORD.

Well... i felt that this faq slowly grinded to a halt, with almost no new
relevant information regarding Wolfenstein 3D. Still personally i think there
are a lot of new info on Wolfenstein 3D, that's why i have gone to the extreme
& written a lot of new information. Some of it will be implemented later as i
will get it rewritten some of the info is still too rough text to get in now,
i will get it in as soon as possible right now i am going out with this
release to show that this FAQ is not completely dead but will keep moving on.

I have put back the add-ons sections expect a real heavy update soon. I
thought Wolf3D was dead, boy was i wrong people all over the internet is still
supporting this tough surviving game, especially now that the source-code is
being used.
The "Wolf3D clones" section has been reduced a lot, only to contain Wolf3D
alike games & not all the new "hitech" games.
Please take a look at the new section 8.0 Wolfenstein the internet section it
will contain news about Wolfenstein homepages.
A special thanks to the former FAQ maintainers. Adam Williamson & the original
Author Stanley Stansiak without them this FAQ would
never have gotten this far.
Hope you like the new FAQ ansi artwork i stole it from the catalog file that
is in the wolf3d shareware zipfile. The A, Y, R, 3, D, & the Q are my own
creations.

I would like to thank all of the contributors to this FAQ.

0.3 Id, APOGEE VS THE FAQ.

Now hear this!
Apogee and id Software have nothing to do with this FAQ.
They do not give me support with it (not counting some e-mail thanks from
J. Wilbur at id Software).
This is NOT an official publication of either id Software or Apogee.
The information contained within this article is provided 'as is' as I
collect it from various Usenet sources.
I do make an effort to check whether the information is correct at the time of
the post, but as usual no guarantees are provided.

0.4 HOW CAN THE WOLFENSTEIN FAQ AUTHOR BE CONTACTED?

I can be contacted via Internet e-mail at the following address:
Bernt (at) fyn13.dk

0.5 HOW CAN I OBTAIN THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE WOLFENSTEIN FAQ?

1) Drop me an e-mail (--> See Section 0.4).
OR
Try Games Domain: www.gamesdomain.com. No guarantees though.

0.6 THE NEW INFO CODING SYSTEM WINTHIN THE FAQ.

*   These are the new sections with newly added information.
**  These are the sections that will be continiously updated.
*+  These are the sections that are written.
*++ These are the sections that are in writing and WILL BE implemented.
    (They should be finished in maximum 6 months).

0.7 WOLFENSTEIN & SOD RELATED FILES AVAILABILITY VIA FTP.

Throughout this FAQ I'll be referring to some Wolfenstein related files.
These can be obtained through Internet FTP archives.
ftp.3dgames.org
directory:
/pub/3daction/wolfenstein3d/

is the official wolf3d site.

****** <<<<<< (will be referred to as '3D Gamers' from now on) >>>>>> ******

I will not include any information on wolf3d related files unless they make
their way to one of these sites. (Nope, wuarchive.wustl.edu won't do Sorry!)
If you don't know how to get them there or don't want to do it yourself
or don't have ftp access then send them to me. I'll be happy to upload them
for you.

0.8 THE FAQ UPDATE RATIO.

Due to some hardware conflicts with my pc, i'm now updating the faq on a
floppy drive. So sections 5.4 - 5.9 are for obvious reasons not being updated
until further notice. The rest of the faq will be updated but only as "small"
updates. However i will only update them with new filenames. (Hooray for the
library :-) ).
It's not only bad news out there a friend of mine have offered me
a free designed homepage, it should open in july from here the faq will be
avaliable to download as a textfile or can be read online.

1.0 THE WOLFENSTEIN NOVICE QUESTIONS.
==============================================================================

1.1 WHAT ARE WOLFENSTEIN AND SPEAR OF DESTINY ?

Wolfenstein-3D is a 3-dimensional action game from id Software.
(distributed as shareware by Apogee). Spear of Destiny is the commercial
sequel of the same game that includes some enhanced graphics.

OBJECTIVE: Survival/Exploration

TYPE: Action

VIEW: First person 3-dimensional perspective.

FEATURES: Smooth scrolling gameplay and character animation.
	  Full 360 degrees view sweep at any angle.
	  VGA graphics (320x200x256), SB/SB-Pro/Adlib/Sound Source support
	  Mouse/Joystick/Gravis pad/Keyboard interface.

DIFFICULTY LEVELS: 4

VIOLENCE RATING: PC-13 (profound carnage - analogous to the movies' PG-13)

COMMENTS: Impacts visually. Highly addictive. Slighty violent.

STORY LINE: In Wolf3D: Basically you're a WWII allied spy imprisoned in
	    Germany and you're trying to escape (full story included with the
	    game). In SoD: Capture the Spear of Destiny from a Nazi
	    stronghold.

AVAILABILITY: First part of Wolf3D is shareware. Extra parts can be ordered
	  from the distributor (more later). For Spear there is a 2-level
	  demo version and the full version can be obtained at your local
	  software store. There are now SoD: Missions 2+3 available as well.

STAGES: Wolf3D: 6 episodes (parts) each containing 10 levels.
		The shareware version only contains episode 1.
		The registered version (pay $$) contains either 3 or 6
		episodes.
		Altogether there are 10, 30 & 60 levels in the shareware and
		two registered versions.
	SoD:    1 set with 21 levels of pulse-pounding action.
		The demo version only contains the first 2 levels.
		The registered version (pay $$) contains the full 21 levels.
		Also available, two extra SoD episodes, created by FormGen
		(NOT id or Apogee). These are very difficult to get hold of,
		Apogee do distribute them, neither do id. I don't think
		FormGen do any more either. (FormGen were the commercial
		distributors for SoD.)
	Wolf3D Super Upgrades Pack: An expansion pack for Wolf3D, compiled
		by Apogee. It contains about 500 extra levels, mostly taken
		from Compuserve or the Internet, of varying quality, the
		latest (1.4) version of Wolfenstein, the level editor
		MapEd and a random level generator (which isn't that bad).

WARNING: Some people have reported being sick after playing or watching
	 others play (a kind of motion sickness if you like). --> See 3.7

1.2 WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO RUN WOLFENSTEIN?

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
	 Processor: 80286 or better (Nope won't run on XT).
	 Graphics:  256Kb VGA or better.
	 Memory:    580Kb Conventional. Also supports EMS, XMS.
	 If EMS/XMS are available the game will use them to preload
	 some of the graphics data.
	 Hard Disk: Wolf3D: Approx. 1.38Mb (Shareware version)
	 Approx. 2.40Mb (Full 6 episodes version)
	 SoD   : Approx. 1.24Mb (Demo version)
		 Approx. 3.06Mb (Full 21 levels version)
		 (Support SB, SBPro, Adlib)

OPERATING SYSTEM & COMPRESSION UTILITY COMPATIBILITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOS        : 5.0, 6.0 (should be downward compatible to 3.3 but wasn't tested)
Other OS's : OS/2, This is one of the most finicky games, and may require
	     some experimentation to make it run well. According to net
	     reports, this game uses a special split-screen mode of the video
	     card, and thus its behavior tends to rely on a person's hardware
	     peculiarities more than OS/2 itself. I find that I can run this
	     game fine, but if I switch away from the game and then switch
	     back to it the bottom portion of the screen will no longer
	     display the statistics for my character.
	     Sometimes the special effects sounds for this game (shots, doors
	     opening, people talking, etc.) will get lost after a brief period
	     of time. If this happens, create a batch file (wolf3d.bat) and
	     have your program object point to the batch file. In the batch
	     file put the following two lines:
	     SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1
	     WOLF3D.EXE
	     The first line tells the wolf3d.exe program which address you are
	     using, which IRQ you are using (in this case it's IRQ5), and
	     which DMA you are using (in this case DMA1). That should solve
	     the loss of special effects sounds. SB-Pro owners should add T2
	     or T3 to the end of the first line (check your docs for details).
	   : Windows3X : (Note if you've got a SB device driver
	     installed under Windows or a Windows TSR
	     like an hour chime running it may interfere
	     with some of Wolfenstein's digitized sounds)
	     Running WOLF3d/SoD under Windows isn't really recommended.
	
	   : Windows NT You can run it in a dos box but, with no sound.
	
	   : Windows 95/98 Usually OK, but certainly not guaranteed. If
	     it doesn't work, either do Start/Shut Down/
	     Restart in MS-DOS mode, or press F8 when
	     booting and the screen says "Starting Windows
	     95" (or "Starting Windows 98") and select
	     Command Prompt Only or Previous Version of
	     MS-DOS.

	   : Linux Redhat 6.1 Yes you can run it with Dosemu it looks strange,
	     (you'll know if ya dare to try) no sound is emulated.
	     Someone have converted the sourcecode so it can run under Linux.
	     Hopefully more info on that later.
	
	   : Dr-Dos (Formerly known as OpenDos). Yes it runs fine.

	   : Acorn/Arcimedes somebody have rewritten the source code to these
	     machines. Hopefully i will get more info on this later.

Compatible with: Stacker: Yes (2.0 & 3.0)
		 Superstor: Yes
		 DOS 6.0's Double Space: Yes

1.3 WHERE CAN I GET WOLFENSTEIN FROM?

You can ftp Wolf3D game from 3D Gamers.
ftp://ftp.3dgames.org/pub/3daction/wolfenstein3d/releases/1wolf14.zip.
If you get it as a file with a .zip extension, you'll need either PKUnzip
(widely available) or WinZip (http://www.winzip.com) to decompress it.
The archive size is approximately 750Kb.
There is an unpacking installation with this latest version (v1.4) of
Wolfenstein so there should be no problem with getting started.

Apogee is no more distributing neither Wolfenstein 3D or Spear of Destiny.
Now Activision have taken over, Wolf3D & SOD + the 2 SOD mission add-ons made
by FormGen is now being sold as 1 package. www.activision.com
Info on ordering is included in the shareware version.
Update: Wolf is available on id's website www.idsoftware.com for $15.
You can buy online and download (securely) or send an order.

The Wolfenstein source code has now been made public. It's available at:
ftp://ftp.3dgames.org/pub/3daction/wolfenstein3d/unsupported/
wolfsrc.zip.
It's not of general interest, though, only to fairly advanced programmers.

1.4 HOW DO I UNPACK SHAREWARE WOLFENSTEIN?

You'll need PkWare's PkUnzip software (version 2.04g) to 'unzip' the file.
Create a spare directory, then copy the file you've obtained into it.
Next use pkunzip to unarchive the file. Like so:

	pkunzip wolf3d14.zip
	pkunzip soddemo2.zip

(Assuming your pkunzip.exe is on DOS's command path.)

1.5 HOW DO I INSTALL IT TO HD?

Through unarching the program in 1.4 above, an INSTALLATION copy of the game
was placed in the current directory. Just run INSTALL program supplied to
install a runable copy on your HD.
You can delete the INSTALLATION copy once a runable copy has been made
(to save disk space of course).
NOTE: Initially you'll need ~4Mb of HD space to unpack and install the game.
For the SoD demo, unarching the program in 1.4 above will place a runable copy
on your HD and you don't need to take any further installation steps.

1.6 CAN I PLAY IT FROM FLOPPY DISK OR CDROM ?

You can play the shareware version of Wolf3D and the demo of SoD from floppy
disk since it's only about 1.38/1.24Mb (we're talking 3.5" High Density disk
here). You'll have to install it to a hard disk first and then copy it across
to a floppy disk.
The full registered versions of Wolfenstein and Spear are much too big for a
1.44Mb floppy (unless you have something like a 20Mb floptical disk drive :)
on which it would easily fit).
The performance of the game running from a floppy is much the same except when
you first load it up it takes it about a minute to load up all the graphics/
map info, so just wait patiently. It's a bit slower between the levels as
well.
In the game itself there is usually no speed differential except in certain
parts where it brings in a page of graphics for some wall panels. You can then
notice a split second pause.
Now a days you could play Wolf3D & SoD on a 120mb floppydisk or a cdrom,
although you can't save your game on a cdrom. :)

1.7 WHAT'S WITH THE VERSION NUMBERS?

The most current version of Wolfenstein 3D is 1.4. The newest version fixes
all known bugs (as did 1.2 at the time, etc.) Apart from that there is not
much of a difference unless it comes to map/graphics editors. --> See 1.8, 1.9
& 4.X
A breakdown of the versions and what the differences are is below.
(If you never played Wolfenstein this will sound meaningless, but then again
if you NEVER played Wolfenstein then where were you this past two years? ;)
NOTE: There may have been some other bugs fixed between the versions which I
don't know about, so if you think you know e-mail me.

v1.0S - First release (05/05/92)
v1.1S - Fixed a lot of digitized effects, still it had a bad habit of loosing
	all sound (just exit to options & press back to game) It's the first
	version to have the secret sprite. Call Apogee say Snappity :)
	(05/20/92)
v1.2S - Fixed most of the secret doors map bug (on level 7 & 8 in episode 1),
	and also some video problems. Fixed the problem with enemies that
	could kill you through walls & other dead points. Also fixed the game
	end sequence (where B.J. yells YEAHH). (01/10/92)
v1.2R - Fixed the last secret door map bug (on level 8 in episode 1 there
	were a secret door left out) first registered release. (06/10/92)
v1.3S - Secret level elevator bug was fixed (introduced in 1.2 :( ) (06/22/92)
v1.4S   pre - Well, There was a pre-release version which was leaked out early
	by Scott Miller of Apogee (11/92). The problem here is that there are
	actually TWO versions of Wolf 1.4 out there. They differ only in the
	address for Apogee (according to Jay Wilbur of ID) but also differ in
	the name of the main program file. The file is named W3D-E1.EXE for
	the pre-release and WOLF3D.EXE for the "official" release.
v1.4S - Fixed the save option if you had saved a game, & reloaded it you would
	have a wrong end time when you ended a level. It also changed slightly
	the graphic backdrop on the opening screen and other menus, changed
	the interior elevator graphic and added a calibration routine in the
	joystick setup menu. still no sound blaster fix for the dogs yelp when
	dying. (12/03/92)
v1.4R - (01/01/93)

The dates next to versions are the file stamp dates of the game .exe file.
They are not the actual market release game dates.

There were other 'internal' changes between versions but they are only
relevant to mapping programs. --> See 4.X

The version numbering of Spear seems to have gone through the same routine,
but currently I only have info on the initial release:
v1.0 - First release (09/28/92)
v1.1 - No information available (yet? call on info)
v1.2 - "	"  "	" "	"
v1.3 - "	"  "	" "	"
v1.4 - Final release, changes from previous versions unknown
	   (01/05/93)

1.8 ARE THERE MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS AVAILABLE, AND WHERE?
	WHAT ARE THEY? AND WHICH FILES DO THEY CHANGE?

Map/Graphics editors can be obtained from the same ftp site as the game.

No, they are not written by id or Apogee nor supported by them.
(Also --> See Section 4.2)

READ THIS! IMPORTANT!  READ! THIS! IMPORTANT!  READ! THIS! IMPORTANT!
******************************************************************************
Apogee ask that you ONLY edit registered wolf3d. The latest level editors
will ONLY work on registered versions. Will FTP sites PLEASE withdraw levels
and graphics capable of running on shareware wolf3d. Anything that will work
on registered wolf3d/SoD, and ONLY registered, is OK.
******************************************************************************
Ok, continuing on...

NOTE:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are strictly not allowed to distribute the executable files from the
registered full version of the game, i.e. any .exe files.
Nor anything from the game for $ unless selling the game to third party
(Legitimate registration transfer).

The editors have been obtained by reverse engineering the map/graphics files
and producing programs that changed those files in a manner consistent with
the game requirements of them.

The editor archives are:
fe1_inst.exe    map viewer/editor
maped41.zip        map viewer/editor
maped42.zip        "   "      "
maped6.zip         "   "      "
maped84.zip        "   "      "
wolfed21.zip       graphics viewer/editor
wolfm160.zip       map viewer/editor version convertor
wlfaud11.zip       sound editor/player

MapEd 8.4 will let you convert between different versions of Wolfenstein
the map encryption for 1.0 is compatible with 1.1 but not with 1.2 and
upwards. (and you may feel left out if you designed maps before with 1.0 and
now have 1.1 or 1.4, etc. Not so!
BTW: 1.2 through to 1.4 are map/graphics compatible as known to date.)

Also maped41[42][6][84]/wolfm160 will automatically detect what version of
Wolfenstein you have installed so you need not worry if you don't want to
convert maps (upgrade/downgrade (!) them).

All of these files include ample docs with them, if you already have them and
want some tips or help on their differences and shortcomings, then --> See 4.X

MapEd 8.4 is fully compatible with Wolf3d, SoD, and Blake Stone 3D. It also
has limited support for other Wolf3D engine games (Corridor 7, for e.g.)

The aforementioned editors change the following files:

Map editors:
MAPHEAD.XXX
MAPTEMP.XXX
GAMEMAPS.XXX
where XXX is either .WL1 for the shareware version or .WL3 and .WL6 for the
registered 3/6 episode versions respectively.
Note that GAMEMAPS.XXX replaced MAPTEMP.XXX in versions of Wolfenstein 1.1 and
higher, i.e. MAPTEMP.XXX is only present in v1.0S & 1.1S. It doesn't really
make any difference since the map editors will recognize that.
For Spear, XXX is either .SDM for the demo version or .SOD for the full
version. To have some of the map editors work with them, you'll need to rename
them to .WL6 files and then back to play the game.
Please consult Section 4.1 to see if the map editor you're using will
recognize SoD .SDM & .SOD file extensions.

Graphics editors:
VSWAP.XXX
where XXX is as before.

1.9 THE WOLFENSTEIN GAME FILES INFORMATION.

AUDIOHED.WL1/WL6 - header info for AUDIOT.WL1/WL6
AUDIOT.WL1/WL6 - data for audio cards (eg soundblaster)
MAPHEAD.WL1/WL6 - byte offsets into the GAMEMAPS.WL1/WL6, for the individual
map levels.
MAPTEMP/GAMEMAPS.WL1/WL6 - header info, followed by MAP LAYER & OBJECT LAYER
pairs.
VGADICT.WL1/WL6 - header info for font desciption in VGAGRAPH.WL1/WL6
VGAGRAPH.WL1/WL6 - opening promo graphics and graphic font description.
VGAHEAD.WL1/WL6 - assumed header into VGAGRAPH.WL1/WL6
VSWAP.WL1/WL6 - graphics texture maps, walls, objects etc.

1.10 ARE THERE DIFFERENT SETS OF READY MADE MAPS/GRAPHICS FILES, AND WHERE?

If you are looking for an alternative set of map or graphic files for your
Wolfenstein game then the sites mentioned in Section 0.7 carry them as well
in the same or sibling directories.
3D Gamers has the add-on maps/graphics/editors, etc. in a sub-directory,
ftp://ftp.gamers.org/pub/3daction/wolfenstein3d/add-ons
Make sure you look through an index file (normally 00index* or README to see
what is what or --> See 5.1 & 5.2 for a short tour)

1.11 HOW CAN I CHEAT IN WOLFENSTEIN?

There is a document on ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca in /pub/wolf3d called wolfdbug.txt
that describes the various cheat options in Wolfenstein and how to access
them.
I have reproduced it here with some updates.

THE WOLFENSTEIN 3-D DEBUG MODE FILE

(v1.0 means Wolf3D version 1.0 and v1.2 means Wolf3D version 1.2S.
Cheating with other versions is equivalent to v1.2S except as noted.)

To enter the mode, do the following:

1. For v1.0, & 1.1 instead of typing "wolf3d" to start the game, type
   "wolf3d next".
   For v1.2, instead of "wolf3d", type "wolf3d goobers".
2. Begin or restore a game. While in the game, hold down the TAB,
   CONTROL, and ENTER keys simultaneously for v1.0, or the LEFT SHIFT,
   ALT, and BACKSPACE keys for v1.2S. You should get a message stating
   that debugging keys are now available.

That's it!

To use debugging mode commands, hold down the TAB key and one of the
letter keys listed below simultaneously:

TAB, B  Change border color  0-15
	
	0 - Black           8 - Dark Gray
	1 - Blue            9 - Light Blue
	2 - Green          10 - Yellow-Green
	3 - Aqua           11 - Lighter Blue
	4 - Red            12 - Light Red
	5 - Violet         13 - Light Violet
	6 - Orange         14 - Yellow
	7 - Light Gray     15 - White

TAB, C  Displays the number of static's, doors, and actors in the level.
     Static's are things like food, ammo, pools of blood, etc., and actors
     are the bad guys. Doors should be self-explanatory.

TAB, E  Moves you ahead two levels. In Wolf3D 1.0S, 1.1S, 1.2S, 1.2R & 1.3S.
     Unlike the W command (see below), this also takes you to the "level
     completed" screen and gives you percentages, bonuses, etc. In Wolf3D
     v1.4S, 1.4R & SoD, it moves ahead just one level. If you have also used
     the "tedlevel" parameter (see below), this command exits the game.

TAB, F  Displays your current position on the level (X,Y) and orientation (A).
     To convert the X and Y values to coordinates that can be used in
     Mapedit, divide them by 65,536 and round down. A is in degrees
     ranging counterclockwise from right. ("Right" refers to the top
     view as seen in Mapedit.)

TAB, G  Turns what id calls "GOD mode" on and off. Basically it just means
     that you're invincible. The screen still turns red when you would
     normally be hurt, though. This can get very annoying if you want to
     do something fun like kill the episode's boss with your knife.

TAB, H  Hurts you (Can i play daddy ? -4% health). (I am death incarnate -16%
     health). Not much use to us, but I guess id had to debug their damage
     code just like everything else.

TAB, I  "Free items." Gives you 56 ammo rounds, and 1000 points it gives
     you the next most powerful weapon. (Machine gun if you didn't have it,
     Gatling gun if you did.)

TAB, M  Displays memory usage. Loads of fun.

TAB, N  Turns "No clipping" on or off. This lets you walk through walls.
     Wall-walking does STRANGE things to the graphics (try approaching a
     door from the side and opening it). It also does strange things
     to the bad guys. If you walk into a room through the wall, often
     they won't notice you at all, even if you walk right in front of
     them or fire your machine gun (in some direction besides at them,
     of course). This command is not available in the registered version
     of Wolf3D nor in shareware versions other than v1.0 & v1.1S, 1.2S but
     it is in SoD.
     (I guess we should be glad that ANY of the commands are available.)

TAB, O  Changes the main viewscreen to a map of the current level, which
     you can scroll through using the movement keys or the mouse. It's
     neat, but I wish that it weren't so ugly. Those numbers are from
     the internal level format. ESC will get you out. Unfortunately
     this command doesn't work in v1.1 nor in SoD.

TAB, P  Pauses the game, without putting up the little "Paused" window.
     I guess this makes it nice for taking a screen shot, although it
     changes the screen border to an ugly bright white.
     Hit ENTER the screen border will stay there for short while & dump you
     back to your OS.

TAB, Q  Bombs the machine in v1.0 & v1.1. Exits the game in v1.2. Both of
     these functions are only useful if your boss comes in :).

TAB, S  Turns slow motion on or off. If you have a slow computer you don't
     need this.

TAB, T  Pops up a window which displays graphics and sounds from the game.
     Use the left and right arrow keys to page through the entries.
     If you come to a blank entry, keep going. You'll know when you've
     reached the end (500-something) because you won't be able to go
     any higher. ESC exits. v1.1S has some interesting graphics that
     v1.0 lacks, including one sprite which is particularly intriguing.
     Don't bother calling Apogee and making yourself look like a fool
     only to be told that you didn't win anything; I already did.
     (You'll understand what I mean when you've seen the sprite.)
     Displays walls, sprites, and sound waveforms.
     Once in this mode you can press:

     ENTER -- displays item if not currently displayed.
     LEFT  -- previous item.
     RIGHT -- next item.
     W     -- goto first wall.
     S     -- goto first sprite.
     D     -- goto first sound.
     I     -- goto sound info.
     L     -- goto last hit. ?
     ESC   -- exit.

TAB, V  Asks you how many extra VBLs you want. High values seem to make
     the game sluggish and not much else.

TAB, W  Warps to any level. Although it prompts for a value from 1 to 10,
     you can actually enter any number up to 20 in the registered
     version. Eleven through twenty correspond to levels one through
     ten in the episode following the one you're currently playing.
     In SoD, it prompts for a value from 1 to 21.

TAB, X  "Extra stuff." Doesn't appear to do anything. If you can amend
     this, let me know.

DEMO RECORDING MODE - This "debugging" feature is not accessed in the
same way as the other commands, and it is available in all versions.

/-------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| YOU NEED TO PUT THE COMMAND LINE WOLF3D.EXE GOOBERS ON TO MAKE IT WORK. |
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/----------------------------------------------------------------\
| IN SPEAR OF DESTINY IT IS SPEAR.EXE DEBUGMODE TO MAKE IT WORK. |
\----------------------------------------------------------------/

To record a demo, follow step one from the beginning of this file.
Hold down TAB at the title screen (the one with B.J. hiding from
a guard). A messagebox will appear with the following text.
"Demo which level(1-10):", the text is the same in both the shareware & the
registered versions. You can go up to level 60 anyway in the registered
version, don't try to demo level 0 this will only result in crashing the game.
Going over level 10 in the shareware game will result in a black screen only
with the music running, i had to reset my computer.
Going over level 60 you will see a large nearly empty level you can't move or
shoot. Recording time is limited to approximately 30 seconds after that
wolf3d will exit with the following message, "demo buffer overflowed".
There are 2 ways to make an succesfull demo.

1 : Die underways recording.

2 : Exit an level alive.

After that an black screen will appear, hit enter exit the game & a file
named by default demo0.wl* have appeared. ren demo0.wl* to e.g. demo1.wl* if
you decide to record another demo.
Unfortunately, there isn't no way to display these demos after
they've been recorded, but if you've ever had a secret desire to play
Wolfenstein 3-D with a big "DEMO" sign at the top of the screen, this is
how to do it. There is unfortunately no way to play it.

SPEAR OF DESTINY - SoD's debugging mode is quite similar to Wolf3D's.
Just use the command-line parameter "debugmode" and the same key combo
as v1.2S. Oh, and be sure to check out what happens to B.J. when you turn
on God mode...

. and then there's always the LIM cheat.

What you do is press L, I and M all together and you get full health & ammo as
well as the chain gun and both keys ;) However, it will reset your score to 0!
(This also renders the tab-I cheat useless). (Hold down the keys as you would
hold control, alt and delete to reset the system).

The equivalent of this cheat for the Mac (I think...the sender did not name
system) is typing in BURGER.

IMPORTANT: It seems that in later registered versions of v1.4 of Wolf3d the
cheat mode has been disabled (apparently Apogee requested it).
At the moment I have no additional info to differentiate these two versions
of v1.4. If you have any such details (like file dates etc.) drop me a line.
The version 1.4 included in the Super Upgrades Pack _does_ allow cheating.
I don't know about the version Apogee sell online.

Apogee has also stated that starting with release of their game 'Biomenace'
all their subsequent shareware game releases will be devoid of any in-built
cheat codes. This is apparently to encourage registering the game (where
the registered versions would have some kind of cheat mode (???) etc.)
Update: this seems to have gone out of the window quite fast :). Witness
all the cheats available in Duke Nukem 3D, for example...

1.12 WOLFENSTEIN 3D COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS.

NOWAIT - Automatically skips several screens at game start.
BABY - Starts game at skill level 1 (Can I play daddy).
EASY - Starts game at skill level 2 (Don't hurt me).
NORMAL - Starts game at skill level 3 (Bring 'Em on).
HARD - Starts game at skill level 4 (I am Death Incarnate).
TEDLEVEL nn - Starts game at any episode and level. "nn" is episode & level
	      numbers minus 1.
You can use the "tedlevel" command-line parameter to quickly
start Wolf3D and warp to any level. The parameter is followed by a
two-digit number. The tens digit is the episode number minus one, and
the ones digit is the level number minus one. For example, to go to
level 10 of episode three, type:
wolf3d tedlevel 29 and to go to the first episode, level 2, type:
wolf3d tedlevel 1
By default, you will play the level on the "Don't hurt me" difficulty
setting. To change this, use one of the command-line parameters "baby"
"easy" "normal" "hard". They stand for the obvious difficulties.
Using the "tedlevel" parameter also gives you an infinite number of
lives. Combine it with "goobers" (or "next") for even more fun.

To go to level 13 of Sod, enter: tedlevel 12.
Note: there is only one episode in SoD so double-digit numbers are used only
for the level number. If you enter "-tedlevel 20" to get to the 21st level
(Angel of Death), the floor number shown in the game will be number 18 as the
level is really an extension of level 18.
By default, unless you specify a level (see above), you will start the game at
episode 1 level 1.

By default, unless you specify a skill level (see above), you will start the
game at skill level 2.

1.13 HOW CAN I CONTACT id Software or Apogee?

Both have websites. id Software are at: http://www.idsoftware.com. Apogee
are at www.apogee1.com. These sites have information on tech support -
email addresses, phone numbers.

1.14 I THINK I FOUND AN ERROR IN THE FAQ.

If you find some information contained within this article incorrect
I'll appreciate you informing me of it ASAP. Email me at this address.

1.15 IS WOLFENSTEIN AVAILABLE ON ANY OTHER PLATFORM THAN AN IBM COMPATIBLE?

There is a SNES version out in 1993 written by Imagineer software under
license from id software & published by Nintendo. (blood changed to sweat,
dogs changed to rats). Due to the Nintendo policy, if we compare the graphics
to the pc version then let me put it this way. Have you ever tried to run Doom
in low resolution, it looks a something like that. Ok when you gets closer to
walls or guards the graphics gets better, the weapons looks really good
compared to the pc version. Are there any other differences ? Yes in the Snes
version you use the map, it's looking a lot like the one in Rise of The Triad.
Different ammo types, up to 299 bullets. More & new weapons A flame-thrower, a
bazooka, cutscenes when you have defeated a boss with debriefing on your next
assignment. Also strafing is a bit different in the Snes version you have a
left & right strafing keys.

A Jaguar (uncensored, slightly altered graphics) version. Was released in
august 1994 by Atari, it is the one with the best graphics which don't tend
to get blocky when getting close to walls & other things. And uses the Jaguar
graphics.

Mac version was released by Macplay a division of Interplay in october 1994,
as shareware.
The Archimedes version has just come out. Apparently it uses the same graphics
as the pc version.

1.16 WHERE CAN I FIND VERSION X.Y OF WOLFENSTEIN?

Could be difficult. Only way to get old versions is to have registered v1.0
and use the patches available at 3D Gamers (in the /releases subdirectory).
This will give you v1.1 and v1.2. The site doesn't have any old shareware
releases, only v1.4.

1.17 WHERE DID id GET THE INSPIRATION FOR WOLFENSTEIN?

The The idea for Wolfenstein came from an old Apple ][ game called Castle
Wolfenstein that the id guys liked. It was created by MUSE Software & was
written by Silas Warner. It was made in the early "80's" & had digitized
and had digitized voices. The story was that you were in a prison
and an injured prisoner gives you a gun he's taken from a guard
and tells you that he can't make it but maybe you can. The castle
holds the plans for Operation Rheingold. You can search guards
and shoot chests. I played it and I couldn't find out what to do.
It isn't a 3D game or virtual reality but you do have a birds eye
view of the room you are in.
They had come up with the idea of the 3D,
texture-mapped, smoothly scrolling engine, and needed a game to use it
with. Castle Wolfenstein seemed ideal. They couldn't think of a better name,
so their legal guys went out and got the copyright on the name, and
Wolfenstein 3D was born!

Here is the story directly from id, here is an extract you can find the full
interview in gamebytes nr 4.

GB: "Were you the guys who wrote the Apple II version of Castle Wolfenstein?"

ID: "No. Silas Warner from Muse systems. Muse wrote the original Castle
Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein."

GB: "Did you have to get permission to use the name?"

ID: "Actually, the copyright for the title Castle Wolfenstein lay
dormant for so long no one cared about it. It ended up belonging to an
old lady in Michigan who didn't care. The legal dudes got in there and
did the legal dude thing and got it for us."

1.18 WHERE DID id GET THE INSPIRATION FOR SPEAR OF DESTINY?

SOD got started by a DC Comic's special comic book called
Justice Society. It probably gave id software the idea for the
game Spear of Destiny. They used the storyline and created a
game.

1.19 WOLFENSTEIN 3D "CAMEO APPEARANCE".

In which movie does Wolfenstein 3D appear ? (here is line from the movie)
(she says) "and Wolfenstein for the kids". The Net starring Sandra Bullock.

1.20 A SPEAR OF DESTINY "SECRET".

To access the hidden picture of the ID crew then go to change view and change
the view once. After you press ENTER then quickly hold down the "I" and the
"D" keys. You will see a picture with weird music playing. Read the message
for some laughs. Some music from the game is playing too.

1.21 MORE SPEAR OF DESTINY "SECRETS".

1.22 WOLFENSTEIN 3D & SPEAR OF DESTINY POPQUIZ.

Now im proud to present the popquiz, it will contain 2 - 3 questions.
The answers will appear in the next revision of this faq, some of the answers
to the questions you will already be here somewhere in this faq. Some others
will be here as new additions in future revisions.

1. Q. In which movie does Wolfenstein 3D appear ? (here is line from the
      movie) (she says) "and Wolfenstein for the kids".
   A. The Net starring Sandra Bullock.

2. Q. The secret sprite saying (call Apogee say Aardwolf) most of us know, but
      there was a secret sprite before the Aardwolf sprite. What did it say ?
   A. Call Apogee say Snappity.

1.27 WOLFENSTEIN 3D CONVERSIONS MADE FOR OTHER 3D GAMES.

1.28 WHO IS B. J. BLAZKOWICZ ?

B.J. was born on August 15, 1911 to Polish immigrants. He
became a top spy for the Allies and the most durable soldier. He
received the Congressional Medal of Honor. B.J was married after
World War II, at the age of forty, to Julia Marie Peterson. They
had a son named Arthur.

1.29 WHAT'S B. J. BlLAZKOWICZ'S RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMANDER KEEN ?

Besides the fact that id Software created both the Commander Keen and
Wolfenstein games, there is a further relationship between the two main
characters. The following is an extract from the Official Hint Manual for
Wolfenstein 3D which explains the relation:

Their son, Arthur Kenneth Blazkowicz, became a television talk show
personality in Milwaukee. For show biz purposes, Arthur changed
his last name to Blaze. Arthur later married Susan Elizabeth
McMichaels. They had one son (which they named after Arthur's
father), William Joseph Blazkowicz II, or as he signs his grade
school homework, B. Blaze....

2.2 HOW MANY SHOTS DO ALL THOSE ENEMIES TAKE TO KILL?

Here is detailed roughly how many shots each normal enemy takes to kill.

1. Dog
1 shot, 1 knife hit.

2. Brown Guard
1 shot if close up and on target, or hit in back, and 2 if at a distance.
If your aim is out it can be 3. About 2/3 knife hits.

3. SS Man
About 8 shots or 12 knife hits.

4. Officer
About 4 shots or 6 knife hits.

5. Mutant
About 8 shots or twelve knife hits.

6. Hitler's Ghost
About 6 shots or 10 knife hits.

2.3 WHAT WEAPONS DO ALL THOSE ENEMIES CARRY?

1. Dog
Bite

2. Brown Guard
Pistol

3. SS Man
Machine gun (you get it if you kill him)

4. Officer
Pistol (does more damage and fires more rapidly than the guard's)

5. Mutant
Pistol (Faster than officer's). Also has cleavers at close range.

6. Hitler's Ghost
Fireballs

7. Hans Grosse
Two chainguns

8. Dr Schabbs
Syringes

9. Hitler
Four chainguns in armour, two out of it

10. Otto Giftmacher
Rocket launcher

11. Gretel Grosse
Two chainguns (more damaging than Hans', I think).

12. General Fettgesicht
Two chainguns and rocket launcher

2.4 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFICULTY LEVELS OF THE GAME?

There are four main differences:
1) There are more guards on harder difficulty levels.
2) They are harder to kill (can take more shots and you have to aim better)
   on harder difficulty levels.
   NOTE: on the lowest level 'Can I play Daddy?' you can generally pick off a
   guard even at long distance with one shot in the general direction
   (well, not every time but often). On the hardest level this usually
   will not happen.
3) On harder levels you take more damage when shot.
4) NB: There are a certain number of guards on difficulty 1 (can I play
 daddy), the same on difficulty 2 (don't hurt me), they just do more harm,
 more on difficulty level 3 (bring 'em on) and a hell of a lot on difficulty
 level 4 (I am death incarnate! meaning: I am death personified, made into
 a person).

There is another minor difference. On the lowest level the 'first-aid kit'
sometimes bumps up your health more than on other harder levels.
--> See 2.8 & 2.15 for more.

2.4 WHAT ARE THE SECRET ROOMS/DOORS IN THE GAME? HOW CAN I FIND ONE?

The secret rooms are like any other room in Wolfenstein except they are
accessed by a 'secret passage' (not really a door). There are certain wall
panels which can be pushed (acted on) like a normal door. The wall will then
slide back revealing a passage to another room. Secret rooms are usually used
to store treasure, food, first aid and ammo packs and more powerful guns, i.e.
the items of interest when survival is at stake (the treasure helps get more
points which accumulate to extra lives, etc.). Sometimes they are used to
store keys to locked doors, but not often (not in the Wolf3D shareware episode
anyway).

NOTE: There is nowhere in the game that anything vital to completion is
hidden behind a secret wall. Keys are just to shortcut routes. id thought
necessary secret rooms would be too hard to find. This is strictly untrue,
but the areas it is used (Episode 1, level 8 for example) are in tiny rooms
where it is dead easy to find the pushwall.

Although there are no strict guidelines to where a secret room might be, you
can get some slight hints on where one might be positioned. Since the maps in
Wolfenstein are true (i.e. they're not warped space) then if you see a block
of wall which is pretty thick and houses no standard rooms (operated by normal
sliding doors) it could potentially house a secret room. Try first the obvious
places on the walls e.g. Hitler's painting, nazi banner & other obvious wall
decorations. Some secret panels are in the corners of a room, others in the
middle of a wall (midpoint of a wall in a standard room). There are also a few
between two objects, like between two plants or two barrels positioned against
the walls. --> See 3.10 for more.

2.5 WHAT ARE SECRET LEVELS IN WOLFENSTEIN? HOW CAN I FIND ONE?

The secret levels are just another level which has been made a bit harder to
find than others. To get to a secret level you must take a special elevator
(well, they don't look special though, in fact in appearance they look like a
normal elevator) from one of the normal (non-secret levels). Elevators like
that are hidden. There's one secret level per episode (so there's one in the
shareware version too :).
When you arrive at a secret level it will be marked 'level 10' on your status
bar. In Spear there are two secret levels in total, marked 19 and 20.
After you finish the secret level the exit elevator will take you back to the
level that you should have gone were it not for the secret level. Say you got
to secret level from level 1, then after secret level (10) you'll end up on
level 2.
For a bit of a spoiler --> See 3.11

2.6 WHAT IS THAT FUNNY OBJECT/SPRITE IN THE GAME?

That funny object only occurs in the registered 3 or 6 episode version of the
game. It is a sign saying to call Apogee. See, it was going to be a part of a
competition with the game, like you find it and then call the distributor
(Apogee it was then) and you could win something (???).
The competition idea was dropped fairly quickly though, after all the mappers
and editors were unleashed only weeks after the game's release. OK, for all
those who haven't found it, the object is a wall saying "Phone Apogee Say
Aardwolf." It isn't very exciting, trust me.

2.7 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CODES LISTED AT THE END OF GAME STATS?

Same thing as in 2.5 the code is the checksum for your score in game. It was
going to be a proof that you actually went through the game and obtain such
and such score.
NOTE: To my knowledge the codes occur in all Wolfenstein versions 1.0 - 1.4.

2.8 ARE THERE GHOSTS IN WOLFENSTEIN? IF SO WHERE? CAN I KILL THEM?

There are two kinds of ghosts in Wolfenstein. The Hitler's ghosts which haunt
you in episode 3 level 9 (the boss level where you kill Hitler). You can
certainly kill those.
There are also some funny Pacman Ghosts in episode 3 level 10 (secret level).
You can't kill those but they can hurt you if you touch them. Just stay clear
and you'll be ok. (Or cheat with GOD MODE --> See 1.10)
In Spear there are ghosts in the final floor (21). These white ghosts can be
shot, but after a short while they reappear. They can also hurt you if you
touch them.

2.9 WHAT DO OTHER OBJECTS APART FROM AMMO, FOOD ETC. DO?

Umm, well ... nothing really. They're there 'cause they look nice.

Here's a short list of all the usable objects:
Ammo clip: gives you ammo (duh)
Ammo box (SoD only): gives you loads of ammo :)
Machine guns (Schmeisser (some people call it PM-40) & Gatling gun): increase
your firepower. NOTE: They do not actually take more powerful bullets, but
the machine gun has rapid-fire and the chain-gun has 2 bullets at a time
rapid-fire. Two bullets from a pistol will kill a guard, so will two from
a pistol - it is just easier to fire from a chain-gun.
Chicken meal, Dog food, Blood pool, Bloody skeleton & First aid kit:
extra health
Cross, Chalice, Treasure chest, Crown: points
Sphere with your face on it: extra life + health + ammo

Doors: open and close these.
Keys: access locked doors.
Elevator: use it to progress to next level.

2.10 I'VE HEARD YOU CAN DRINK BLOOD IN WOLFENSTEIN? IS THAT TRUE? HOW?

You can slurp up the blood pools and consume the bloody skeletons if your
health falls below 11%.

2.11 WHAT IS 'DEATH CAM'? HOW IS IT ACTIVATED?

Death Cam is a animation replay of the final few seconds of the killing
sequence of some the games bosses (you know, the huge guards). The only bosses
subject to Death Cam are:
	Dr. Schabbs (episode 2)
	Hitler (episode 3)
	Otto Giftmacher (episode 4)
	General Fettgesicht (episode 6)
The Death Cam is activated after you kill one of these bosses. After the
replay the current episode concludes regardless of whether you killed all
other guards, etc.
There is no Death Cam in Spear. It has a nice set of end screens though.

NOTE: Deathcam does not replay your killing, from your viewpoint - it just
shows all the guy's dying frames from close up, so it is always the same.

2.12 WHAT IS THE JUKEBOX FEATURE OF WOLFENSTEIN? HOW IS IT ACCESSED?

The JukeBox feature of Wolfenstein is just a menu of different music
scores that normally play through the different levels of Wolfenstein.
To access it press and hold 'm' while Wolfenstein starts (after you started
it from DOS).
Now you can listen to that favourite tune from the game.
The Jukebox is present in all versions as I understand (shareware/registered
1.0 through to 1.4). The menu of music scores may be different between
the versions but it nevertheless is there.

2.13 WHAT ARE THOSE MUSIC TUNES IN WOLFENSTEIN?

What is the theme music for Wolfenstein 3-D?

The tune that opens Wolf 3-D is known as the "Horst Wessel Lied" (Horst
Wessel's Song), which was the official Nazi party anthem. Here are the
first couple of bars to the lyrics, though further research will follow:

(translated from the original German)

Raise high the flags! Stand rank-on-rank together.... SA will march with
steady, quiet tread....

Historical background: Horst Wessel was an average SA (Sturmabteilung --
literally, Storm Detachment; which was the Nazi goon squad) trooper and
local party leader in Berlin. He was killed in a street brawl with
Communists in 1930, but not before leaving the words and music to the tune
that became the Nazi anthem. It was played along with the official German
national anthem, whose tune is still used today, although with different
lyrics than what was played in Nazi Germany.

Other musical trivia: a few bars of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Marine Corps anthems are played throughout the game. In one of the music
pieces, a Morse-code message is played in the background...

The music on episode 1, mission 9 is vaguely reminiscent of the British
National Anthem, God Save The Queen/King (depending on who is the monarch
at the time).

2.14 WHAT IS THAT MORSE CODE MESSAGE IN WOLFENSTEIN?

In Episodes 3 & 6 of the registered version the music seems to
include a Morse code beeping in the background.

I have scooped the following from UseNet's comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action
(I don't know the originator, you know who you are)

Here it is:

TO BIG BAD WOLF DE ["de" means "from" in amateur radio Morse code jargon]
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
ELIMINATE HITLER
IMPERATIVE COMPLETE MISSION WITHIN 24 HOURS
OUT

2.15 ARE THERE ANY MORE CHEATS/HINTS AVAILABLE?

There is a hint book for Wolfenstein 3D, and another for SoD. They're both
actually well worth having. They map out every level (for Wolf, all 60, for
SoD, all 21 of the first episode - I don't think FormGen made hint books
for the two extra episodes), with help for getting through the level based
on important points through the level. they show all secret areas and all
secret levels, and also have a mine of trivia about the game's development
and some of the characters.

2.16 THE STATISTICS & RECORDS SECTION (NUMBERS ABOUT THE GAME).

Ok, at the risk of repeating myself here goes:

The boss and secret levels have no par level time.

The following table shows the par level times for all SoD levels:
Level   1       2       3       4       6       7       8
	1:30    3:30    2:45    3:30    4:30    3:15    2:45

	4:45    6:30    4:30    2:45    4:30    6:00    6:00
Once again, the boss and secret levels have no par level time.

Extra life: every 40000 points or if you find the icon.
NOTE: extra life icon counts as treasure! If you forget one --> no 100%
      treasure statistic!

NOTE: Par times cannot be edited with any edit programs I know - anyone
seen one?

Average number of rounds (on 'Death Incarnate' difficulty) required to kill:
Dog: 1
White ghost (SoD): 1
Brown guard: 2
SS trooper: 5
White officer: 3
Undead: 3

Minimum number of rounds required to kill:
Ghost of Hitler: 25
Hans: 40
Hitler: 70 to blast him out of his harness &
another 70 to finish him off.
Other Bosses: 80

3.0 THE FLAMING SECTION. (YOU'RE ANNOYED WITH WOLFENSTEIN BECAUSE...)
==============================================================================

3.1 IT CRASHES.

Usually the reasons for Wolfenstein bombing out are these:

1) You have a hardware conflict with your soundcard.
2) You have a software configuration problem.
3) You have more than one version of Wolfenstein and some game files from the
   versions are mixed.

1 & 2 are discussed later --> See 6.1 & 6.2

If you mixed Wolfenstein versions or put different home-brew add-on maps in
the same directory then Wolfenstein might hang since map and graphics file
formats are different from version 1.1 onwards.

3.2 THE SOUNDS ARE ALL SCREWED.

Either your card is not fully Soundblaster compatible or you have IRQ or DMA
conflict. --> See 6.1

3.3 YOU ARE LEFT WITH A GUN AND 8 BULLETS AFTER YOU DIE.

Solution
a) Cheat (--> See 1.10)
b) Learn about secret rooms and how to find them (--> See 3.10), there is
   plenty of ammo/food inside them.
c) Save often.
d) The blue SS troopers carry machine guns. Toast one with your gun and you
   can pick up his machine gun. If you have the machine gun already, he just
   drops an ammo pouch.

3.4 IT'S TOO HARD.

--> See 3.3 & 3.10
Also start on an easy difficulty level. Don't despair, you'll get better. One
of the advantages of veteran players is that they know the layout of the maze.
They know where to find ammo, food, etc.
As you get familiar with the game you'll also be able to judge how many shots
to fire and where to aim. Thus you can conserve your ammo.
To preserve health learn how to use the strafe function (useful when ducking
around corners).
Also don't just plunge into rooms. Hang back and see if any guards come
running out. Then ... Pang!
Some difficulty can also be attributed to disorientation of new players.
Several corridors or rooms may look alike. Try look for dead bodies (i.e. the
trail that you've left behind) or other characteristic objects.
If you're having trouble with movement then --> See 3.6 & 3.7
One nice hint I've received is about slowing the game a little. If you have
turned on debugging keys then holding TAB slows the game down a bit (not as
slow as slow motion from the debugging options). This means that you can let
off a couple of accurate shots before the targets (guards etc.) have time
to react. Great for some tight rooms and conserves ammo as well.

3.5 IT'S TOO EASY.

Like a challenge eh? Check out some home-brew maps. --> See 5.1
You might also try to reduce your health with the cheat mode (--> See 1.10)
or decide to play without machine guns. Take that for a challenge.

3.6 YOU KEEP RUNNING INTO THE WALLS AND MISSING THE DOORS.

Sounds like a major new user disorientation syndrome to me, but could also be
attributed to a slow computer. See, slower machines sacrifice the frame rate
to keep the gameplay speed constant. Thus you might miss a few frames here and
there and that will fool you into overshooting your targets (doors, guards
when you're aiming your pistol at them, etc.) Strafe function helps here
sometimes.
You can also try experimenting with various input devices. Mouse is more
accurate on position but slower when it comes to movement. Joystick is rather
inaccurate but easy to handle and still slow. Especially your rotation speed.
If you have a Thrustmaster or other joystick + configurable buttons you can
program these for strafe & run functions. That should make it a little easier.

3.7 YOU ARE FEELING DIZZY WHILE YOU PLAY IT.

There have been a lot of discussion about this phenomenon. In short some
people experience dizziness attributed to the game movement. There were many
theories, most along the line of motion sickness.
Some also said that the animation is too smooth so it fools your brain into
believing it to be real. Others said its too jerky and it makes you vomit like
being sea sick. Another popular theory is that lack of proper acceleration
(like on-off high speed) attribute to the nausea.
I will not go into discussion of why. Rather I'll post some steps people
suggested. Remedies are not guaranteed to work. There are many, all are
experimental and some will have opposite effects on different people. This, it
seems, is a very individual problem.

a) Try different display sizes. Either different size monitors or use the F5
   function to vary the display window.
b) Try sitting closer/further from the display (but don't stick your nose in
   it, I don't want you to get radiation sick). Combine with focusing/
   defocusing on the display or surroundings (your room, etc.) This is to see
   if you're being aware that you're looking at the monitor (by seeing other
   objects around it) and hopefully it may convince your brain that what you
   play is not really real.
c) Try different machine speeds. If you have a turbo switch try playing with
   it on/off. See what the difference is.
d) Try different input devices (--> See 3.6) With a mouse you can control
   acceleration more accurately than with a joystick or the keyboard.
e) Play on your friend's/collegue's computer. See if it's better/worse.
f) Have breaks while you play. Play in turns. Watch others play & then play
   yourself.
g) If you have Soundblaster try playing with/without the sound. If your
   soundcard is stereo try playing with headphones on. Reverse the headphones
   so that left becomes right. Does it confuse you more. (It has no difference
   on me if you want to know ;) This one is not meant as a torture (Hehe) only
   to see if you're generally well adaptive.

After I switched machines from 386SX-25Mhz to 486DX-33Mhz I had problem
adjusting too. Everything seemed "too smooth". Now when I see it on the 386 it
makes me want to vomit. Sometimes you'll have to give it time to adjust.

3.8 IT NEVER GIVES YOU 100% STATS AT THE END OF LEVEL/GAME.

Hmm, must have missed some treasure/secret room/enemies.

Solution:
1) Improving secret room ratio --> See 3.10
2) Improving treasure ratio = Improving secret ratio since most remaining
   treasure you missed is probably hidden.
3) Improving kill ratio.
   A few dogs running wild may be the cause.
   There's also a few places in the maze where the guards can follow you in
   circles. Back up your tracks, you might smash into one around the corner.

3.9 YOU ALWAYS RUN OUT OF AMMO/HEALTH.

There's plenty of ammo/food/first aid around to last to twice the fun. Problem
is knowing where to find it. Be careful to not leave behind ammo clips dropped
by guards after you kill them. Its only 4 rounds but it adds up. Sometimes
ammo/food/first aid is concentrated in a couple of rooms on a level. If you
find that cache you'll have no problems. Some levels have relatively little
food/first aid but lots of ammo. It may be wise to plan ahead and stay healthy
for that level. You can also plainly waste ammo and overshoot ensuring you'll
be hit as little as possible. Other levels may have little ammo and lots of
food/first aid. Adopt ammo saving strategy there.
Remember that extra-life sphere boosts both your health and ammo.
Also --> See 3.10

3.10 YOU CAN NEVER FIND ANY SECRET ROOMS.

Secret rooms usually house most of the treasure, ammo and health bonuses as
well as machine guns and extra lives.

Some "obvious" places where a secret room may be located are shown below:

NOTE: W  = wall, o = static object like: barrel, drum, plant, etc.
	  #  = different wall panel like: Hitler's painting, Nazi banner, etc.
	  [  = Sliding door.
	  Possible secret doors are pointed to by < ^ and > or shown as ?

a) Different wall panels

WWWWWWWW#WWWWWWW#WWWWWWWW
W       ^       ^       W
W                       W
# <                     [
W                       W
W                       W
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

b) Room corners.

W?WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?W
?                       W
W                       W

W                       W
?                       W
W?WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?W

c) Between objects and at midpoints of a wall.

WWWWWWWWWWWW?WWWWWWWWWWWW
Wo                      W

e) On wall panel in straight line extending from an object
   (classic object in this example is an overhead lamp!)

WWWWWWW?WWWWWWWWWWW
W
W
[      o               <-- A corridor
W
W
WWWWWWW?WWWWW

NOTE: Some secret rooms have secret rooms within them. Sometimes secret
	  movable panels can be moved to block each other. Be careful not to
	  block yourself in. This is also why sometimes you cannot get 100%
	  secret ratio for some levels.

3.11 YOU CAN NEVER FIND A SECRET LEVEL.

Well, if you read Section 2.4 you'd know that you need to find a secret level
elevator to get to a secret level. These elevators are hidden inside secret
rooms (that is, behind pushwall passages). They can be pretty darn hard to
find without a map. To get you going here's one from episode one.

Here we go. The secret level elevator for episode 1 is on level 1! It is
accessible by a series of secret doors (pushwalls) in the last room of that
level (the room with the normal elevator). I've drawn the room out below.

3.12 YOU ALWAYS GET NUKED BY THAT BIG BAD BOSS (GUARD) AT THE END.
	 (THE STRATEGIES FOR DEFEATING THE BOSSES).

Note: This section is *far* from complete. Why not send in your hints
      for wiping those tough guys at the end.

---
Well, here's a general guide submitted by Douglas Bottoms
(BOTTOMS_DOGLAS_J (at) Lilly.com)

"Usually, I try to get as close to the boss as possible, then back STRAIGHT
away from the boss while firing. Then strafing left or right to hide behind
a wall (or get out of the way)."

NOTE: Generally not a good strategy above "Don't Hurt Me" level.

---

Note: You will find that most boss scenarios conveniently include blocks
of wall behind which you can hide while the boss fires its 'salvo'.

Here is a specific one pertaining the Mad Doc at end of Episode 2.

---
Episode 2: This is the Mad Doctor who is creating all the Zombies. If you go
at him straight on he'll just zap you with his syringes and you'll go all
red-eyed and die. If you go to the corridor to the left of the room where
he's hiding and wait for him to come out you can zap him with the old chain
gun from the side. There's also a first-aid kit in there which helps. Once
he's retired back to the room rush out to the beginning of the level where
there is a secret room (which you will already have opened up) full of ammo
clips and restock on ammo. Now you can go back in for a frontal assault and
 finish him off. This guy doesn't fire much - I hit him a bit, get out of
 the way, hit him a bit, get out of the way...
---

..and here is one specific one for Hitler at the end of Episode 3.
---
Episode 3: Hitler is to the left of the entrance to the final room in the
final level. Hit him with the chain gun until his armor drops away. Then
rush down to the end and turn right, knock off the 2 white guards in there
and you'll find lots of extra ammo and some first aid. If you lurk here
Hitler may come after you - in which case blast him, or if you wait long
enough he'll seem to go away. If this happens go right back to the beginning
of the level where there is a secret room full of ammo and stock up because
you'll find he's trailed you. So turn round fast and give him everything
you've got.

SPECIFIC SOD BOSS STRATEGIES

Trans Grosse- Trans Grosse guards the way to the Dungeons. He
uses two chainguns.

Get the chaingun in the secret passageway in the left passage way
when you start the level.

W= wall
P= secret passageway
C= chaingun
O= you
E= elevator wall

When you enter the room inside the three doors be careful or the
SS will shoot you in the back. Kill all the guards and SS and
then enter the boss room where Trans Grosse lives. The boss will
see you so go right until you come to a room with four SS. The
room is NOT behind a door. Keep looking to see if the boss is
coming towards you. Search the room until a secret passageway is
revealed. Lure Trans Grosse in the passageway because there is
health there. Blast him out of his socks as you move over the
health. Keep doing this until he is dead. If you decide to
explore the floor before you exit, then don't fall for deadly
pink-brick wall death trap unless you have a chaingun, plenty of
ammo to wipe out seven SS, or God Mode. Happy killing!

Barnacle Wilhelm- Barnacle Wilhelm guards the way to the Main
Castle. He uses a chaingun and a missile launcher.

In order to defeat Barnacle Wilhelm, you first have to get the
silver keys to enter his lair. After you have found the key and
have gone into the Barnacle room, kill all of the guards, SS, and
officers in the slots in the wall. Then you can finish Wilhelm
off while hiding behind the wall blocks.

Ubermutant- Ubermutant guards the way to the Ramparts. He has
only one chaingun but is VERY fast.

To defeat Ubermutant, you must find the key to get inside the
Uber-chamber is. When you open the locked door push the secret
passageway and then open the door on the left. Wipe out all of
the guards and get some health and ammo before opening the door
to the steel chamber. After you get the health and ammo only then
you may open the door. Make sure that Ubermutant sees you and
run, not walk, outside into the hallway where you started the
level on and dodge between the walls and fire upon him. If he
finds his way out of the chamber of you lead him out then you
should try to get back into the chamber or take your chances and
finish him off.

Death Knight- Death Knight guards the way to the Spear and the
Death Dimension. He uses two chainguns and two missile launchers.

To defeat Death Knight then get the chaingun and ammo boxes when
you are brave enough to get out of the elevator. Enter the Death
Knight's lair and head to the left seeking the door (there's one
less mutant on this side). Go out the door and toast the officers
and the SS and go left for ammo and right for health. Now get rid
of his helpers and chip away at him through an open door (the
missiles will probably hit the side of the door). After you kill
the Death Knight then open the locked door, touch the Spear and
now you have just beaten the game!!!!! NOT!

The Angel of Death- The Angel of Death is the guardsman of the
Spear. He uses green spheres of holy fire.

To defeat the Angel of Death you must first find the chaingun.
Then if your duel with Death Knight lowered your health a little
then GET SOME! As soon as the Angel sees you then wait until he
shoots three spheres. As he rests blast him in the face. When you
kill him then try to kill some ghosts before the five seconds you
have left before the game is over run out. There this time you
DID beat the game.

Barnacle Wilhelm- This boss shoots a missile launcher and a
chaingun. The combination of short and long range attack make
Barnacle difficult to defeat.
AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHOTS TO KILL- Eighty.

Ubermutant- Ubermutant is Dr. Schabbs most prized creation. With
four butcher knives in each of his four arms, nimble legs, and a
chaingun in his chest make this the ultimate zombie.
AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHOTS TO KILL- Eighty.

Death Knight- Death Knight wields two chainguns and two missile
launchers making him the toughest boss you have ever faced. His
body armor covers all of his body except his face. This guy
proves to you that a spoon full of sugar DOESN'T make the
medicine go down!
AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHOTS TO KILL- Eighty

Angel of Death- To protect the Spear, Hitler made a blood pact
with the Angel of Death telling the Angel that he could have the
souls of his Nazi soldiers. In return the Angel guards the Spear
for as long as Hitler is alive.
AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHOTS-???

4.0 MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS SECTION
==============================================================================

4.1 DISCUSSION OF AVAILABLE MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS.

There are 6 map/graphics editors available as far as I know.

a) MAPEDIT v4.1 - Map editor.

a) MAPEDIT v4.2 - Map editor.

a) MAPEDIT v6.0 - Map editor.

a) MAPEDIT v8.4 - Map editor.

b) WOLFMAP v1.6 - Map editor/version convertor.

a) SODEDIT v1.1 - Map editor.

a) WOLFMAN2 v2.0 - Mapeditor.

d) FLOEDEDIT v0.99b - Mapeditor/graphics editor/extractor.

c) WOLFEDIT v2.1 - Graphics editor/extractor.

a) WOLFENMAP v5.0 - Mapeditor.

Mapedit v4.1
	- Written by Bill Kirby (who incidentally retired from working on his
	  creation).
	  This software will let you edit Wolfenstein's maps for any version
	  released to date (1.0 through to 1.4). It will recognize if your
	  copy is shareware, or registered (3 episode or 6 episode).
	  Turbo Pascal source is included so you can make your own
	  adjustments.
	  NOTE: Not compatible with SoD.

	This is the 'vanilla' version of this editor. Many have changed this
	version to produce their custom 'enhanced' editors with more features
	etc. (Thus this version is where the version tree splits).
	The following two are the most popular.

Mapedit v4.2
	- Written by Ralf Seider (rauh (at) wrcd1.uni-wcppertal.de)
	  Some new functions were added to v4.1
	  - Item selection memory while editing.
	  - Can select items from map (pick up using mouse)
	  - Fill & rectangle functions for easier level construction.
	  NOTE: Not compatible with SoD.

Mapedit v6.0
	- Written by Dave Huntoon & Brian Baker
	  Some bugs of v4.1 fixed.
	  Some new functionality added
	  - Copy, Paste
	  - Exchange (maps)
	  - Help (ah, user friendly)
	  - Write / Read individual levels to / from disk
	  - Statistics display (# of actors on level etc.)
	  - Compatibility with SoD.

Mapedit v8.4 [*** Faq editor's choice ***]
	- Written by Warren Buss, David Huntoon and Bryan Baker
	  - Blake Stone compatibility
	  - Zap function
	  - Loads of other useful stuff!

Wolfmap v1.6
	- Written by Jan Peter Dijkstra (Sysma Automatisering).
	  This one was based on an old version of Mapedit but then evolved
	  into an editor of its own.
	  It's really more of a Wolfenstein map processor with functions such
	  as: version conversion, level map export into intermediate file
	  (allows moving and copying of levels), level ASCII dump for printing
	  purposes, etc. The editor is really based on Mapedit visually with
	  slightly more functionality. C++ source included.
	  NOTE: Not compatible with SoD.

Wolfman2 v2.0
	 - Written by Digital Aasvogel Group.
	   This editor is only compatible with wolf v1.0 & 1.1, supports
	   editing, placing, & grabbing.
	   Note: Not compatible with SoD.

Sodedit v1.1
	- I really can't tell you much about it until i get a hold of a
	  copy of it.

Wolfenmap v5.0
	  - I hope that you're not one of those who have paid 35$ for this
	    shareware editor.

Floedit v1.0
	- Written by Florian Sthr. The text is taken from floedit.hlp.
	  Welcome to FloEdit, world's best editing tool for the popular
	  ID-Software games "Wolfenstein-3D" and "Spear Of Destiny". This is
	  the only tool available that gives you the following functionality:
	  Edit, print and import/export maps: Things made easier by FloEdit,
	  giving you unlimited undo/redo support, multi-clipboarded cut &
	  paste and auto-insertion of floor commands!
	  images, walls and sprites (no size limits in your sprites!)
	  import/export and ADD digitized sound.
	  Please note that if you'd like to change the size of anything or if
	  you want to add new sprites, images or sounds, you'll always have to
	  recompile the game! (This is not necessary for adding new walls).
	
	  Please note : Floedit is written for Windows 9X, It works fine under
	  Windows NT 4.0 too. You will have to install DirectX, can't remember
	  what version is needed. With version 6.0 it runs fine.
	  You can download here : http://www.wolfnode.de this is the Official
	  Floedit Homepage. This just shows that banning games will not stop
	  people from getting them anyway :=}
	  It fills 5.5 mb and when installed floedit.exe fills 2.1 mb. If you
	  want to save some space use UPX to crunch down floedit.exe, i did
	  it works fine with floedit.exe minimized to 210 kb. Have a look in
	  section 11.0 for the UPX homepage.

Wolfedit - Written by Bill Kirby (again!). This is a must if you want to
	   change Wolfenstein's graphics. Not only does it let you edit the
	   wall panels as well as images of guards and various objects. You
	   can also export/import images as GIF files. This makes editing with
	   your favorite paintbrush tool easy. The picture size is limited to
	   64x64 pixels but for importing images you can position a square on
	   a larger image and snap it into the editor.
	   Wolfedit will not read SoD graphics file as such (VSWAP.SOD file).
	   If you're trying to edit SoD graphics then just rename your
	   VSWAP.SOD file to VSWAP.WL6 before editing. Rename it back after
	   you finished.

4.2 RULES TO FOLLOW WHEN EDITING.

IMPORTANT! READ THIS! IMPORTANT! READ THIS! IMPORTANT! READ THIS! IMPORTANT!
******************************************************************************
First of all I would like to stress that id Software and Apogee are not
responsible for the home-brew add-ons floating around. They will offer
you no support whatsoever if you encounter problems with them so
DO NOT CALL Apogee about them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even when Wolfenstein bombs out with an error message giving you the
1-800 number of Apogee DO NOT CALL if you were playing the non-original
maps/graphics. Apogee especially DOES NOT appreciate it.
If you want to get help about it read the rest of this section. If you find
no clues post to comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action for help.
******************************************************************************

Ok, Here's a few guidelines if you're just starting to play around with the
editors. I thought I'd put something down that might save you from screaming
ARGHHH!! after a few hours of editing. Most of these are just a few pointers.

- First of all save your work often. This one needs no explanation.
- Also test it often. Some editing quirks will produce game bugs that are just
  plain hard to get rid off. That might mean you'll have to start editing that
  level from scratch.

Mapping hints:
	- When placing elevators, put them like this:
	
   ********************
   *                  *E
   [                  D E
   *                  *E
   ********************

   [ = Normal door
   D = Elevator door
   E = Elevator segment.

	  Landscape objects are similar in that they are displayed as
	  landscape when aligned east/west and as starry skies when aligned
	  north/south.
	  If you REALLY want to have elevators north/south then the elevator
	  lever would have to be one of the side panel (as you enter the
	  elevator).
	- Secret elevator needs floor number 6B (hex) inside it to work
	  properly.
	- Mobile guards and dogs can have arrows (turning points) to direct
	  them. Place these on the path you want them to move. When they
	  notice you they'll obviously break from that pattern, otherwise
	  they'll follow it. If no turning points are set, they will keep on
	  walking in the direction you set them off in, walking through walls
	  and everything. In other words, SET TURNING POINTS!
	- Note that when placing guards and dogs on the same arrowed path
	  you might screw up the pattern since dogs are faster than the guards
	  and will finally 'bunch up' behind them.
	  See map of episode 1 level 2 for an example of this.
	- Number of objects on one level is limited to 399.
	  Secret doors and guard guiding arrows are NOT objects.
	  Actors are not objects either.
	- Number of actors (guards/dogs, etc.) on one level is limited to 149.
	  Note that dead guards are considered actors too.
	- Number of doors (sliding doors, NOT secret doors) on one level is
	  limited to 64. This includes unlocked, locked and elevator doors.
	- Don't forget you need an entrance to a level.
	- You also should have an exit or game end trigger (see level 9 of the
	  shareware version to see how it's done.)
	- The exit must be the elevator icon unless you changed the graphic.
	- Exit from level 9 leads to level 10. Thus you can have 10 straight
	  levels with no secret level.
	- Secret doors can "collapse" onto one another. Thus if you have many
	  secret doors in a row with only the first secret door positioned
	  over a wall you can repeatedly push the same wall panel.
	- Too many guards in one room or area will result in the disappearing
	  bodies phenomenon. --> See 6.3
	- Only guards over the same floor as you will hear you shoot your gun.
	  Since this concept is quite important to game strategy here's a
	  little explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you fire your weapon (this does include the knife but only if you actually
poke someone) in a room then all the non-deaf guys in the same room who
stand/walk over the same floor values will hear you. That is they will become
active and try hunt you down.
Also guys in other rooms which are not connected to your present room at the
moment (What I mean is the doors between that room and your current room where
you are are closed) will also hear you if they stand/move over the same floor
value.
This allows for a variety of dynamic effects, e.g. see below:

   1               2                 3
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
   G1  G2 W        G4           W     G5
	  W                     W
	  [        G3           [
   Y      W                     W
	  W                     W
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^            ^^^^^^^^^^^
room             room                room
with             with                with
floor            floor               floor
 A                B                   A

Here's a quick sketch of 3 rooms (walls=W) connected by sliding doors [.
You (Y) are in room 1. Rooms 1 & 3 have the same type of floor. Room 2 has
a different type of floor. G1-G5 are guards.
If you shoot your weapon in room 1 then guards G1, G2 as well as G5 will
become aware of your presence (G1 & G2 probably are already aware of you if
they saw you). G5 will run from room 3 to room 2 (tracking your position in
straight line). Eventually he would get to room 1. If you fire your weapon
while either of the doors are open then G3 & G4 will will become aware of you
too.
NOTE: You didn't open either doors (I'm assuming G5 or G3 or G4 does that)
unless you ran for it ;)

The first floor value in the Mapedit/Wolfmap editor index is the DEAF floor
(hex value=6A; this should be annotated in map editors).
The guards standing on deaf floors will react only if you pass within their
sight (that seems to span slightly less than 180 degrees (~90 either side of
their face)).

Note that if you mix floors in one room (other than the DEAF floor) then only
the floor which connects to the door through which you entered will become
active. Guards standing on other floors will be oblivious to you unless you
shoot at them (not sure if you can run through them).

In a way when you enter through the sliding doors a change of active floor
takes place (after the door shuts --> while it's open both floor values are
active).

A classic example is when you enter a room through a secret door. If the
floor in that room is different then no guard in that room will respond to
you shooting.

If you're still unclear about this here's an explanation by id's
J. Romero (straight from the horse's mouth so to speak):

"Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed
rooms. When you open a door, the guards get a chance to
see you and opening the door connects your sound area to
the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will be heard
in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this
kind of action".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Putting an object inside a wall allows you and other actors to walk
	  through that wall. Now you know how that guard jumped you from the
	  wall.
	- Directing moving actors (guards, dogs, etc.) into a wall of unity
	  thickness makes that square wall panel permeable. That is you can
	  walk through it in the same way as if you used the wall walking
	  cheat. (--> See 1.10)
	- You must have a minimum of at least the following on any level you
	  create:
	  1 enemy (guard, dog, etc...)
	  1 piece of treasure (cross, jewels, etc...)
	  1 secret door
	  They are needed because Wolfenstein tries to calculate the % of each
	  of that you have killed, opened, picked up, etc..., and if there are
	  0 items of any one of the above, Wolfenstein will crash trying to
	  divide by zero. That problem have been fixed in Wolf3d version 1.4.
	- Secret doors can pass over/through any object that you can (kitchen
	  utensils, food, etc.) EXCEPT Dead Guards.
	- Be careful not to set up secret doors that might go beyond the edge
	  of either the bottom or left-hand sides. The top and right hand
	  edges of the "world" are solid, but the left and bottom sides are
	  permeable (no range checking), and weird things can happen.
	- Be careful not to set up secret doors such that a small passage
	  behind them is blocked when the 'pushwall moves too far' phenomenon
	  occurs. Either insure that the pushwall can move only 2 grid
	  locations or enlarge the passage. --> See 6.3
	- Doors should be parallel to the walls you are inserting them in, as
	  you will get phantom blocks of grey stone otherwise.
	  Try placing a door all by itself without any walls and you will see
	  that it is accompanied by two phantom walls on either side. This has
	  presumably something to do with the opening act of a door (???). You
	  can go through these blocks, and even open the doors within them.
	  To clarify that here's a sketch of a door just by itself with no
	  walls around:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		P[P

		 ^
	  [ - Door
	  P - Phantom wall block
	  ^ - Direction you face when opening the door.

	  Now, if you place the door perpendicular to the wall its embedded in
	  here's what you'll end up with:

		  P
	  WWWWWWWW[WWWWWW
		  P

	  Obviously you can't see the door until you pass through the P wall.
	  BTW: The phantom walls P look like the regular stone wall (or the
		   first wall in the graphics file for that matter).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Deaf Guard floors directly in front or behind a sliding door result
	  in the door being invisible. The floor seems to be replaced with a
	  "force field" (it becomes an invisible wall).
	  Of course, if what you want is an invisible barrier, then this is
	  how to do it.
	  Note that if you put a Deaf Guard in an elevator, you will not be
	  able to get in! (I think this only occurs in v1.0 of Wolfenstein,
	  later versions allow you to have deaf elevator floors)
	- If you make regular sliding doors into secret doors, they behave
	  rather strangely, when you "open" them. They move away and transform
	  into a random wall panel.
	- Placing two or more doors side-by-side will produce a bizarre
	  "picket fence" wall of crazed wall panels, and will not allow you to
	  pass through them (except the last door on the right side) but will
	  let the bad guys through.

Editing the graphics, hints:
	--> See later part of 4.5

4.3 COMMON EDITING ERRORS (WHAT NOT TO DO AND WHAT THEY'LL PRODUCE).

	- You forgot to put an entry position into a level.
	  When you start that level you'll find that you can't move around and
	  you see walls in all directions.
	- You put too many guards in one level.
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
	  that level:
	  'GetNewActor: No free spots in objlist!'
	- You put too many objects in one level.
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
	  that level:
	  'Too many static objects'
	- You put too many doors in one level.
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
	  that level:
	  '64+ doors on level'
	- You included in your shareware episode map some objects used in
	  non-shareware episodes only.
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when that
	  object/wall comes into your view:
	  'Tried to load sparse page'
	  If you patch the map and try to continue from the last saved
	  position within the same level, you'll still get this error as
	  Wolfenstein stores the map as loaded on level entry in the save-game
	  file. You must restart from a saved position in the previous level.
	  Hint: always save before taking up the exit elevator of a level.
	- You have mixed versions of Wolfenstein maps or have corrupted
	  map files.
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when you start
	  the play:
	  'Map not 64x64'
	  Usually this is due to the fact that you might have only one
	  MAPHEAD.??? file in the editor's directory and many
	  MAPTEMP.???/GAMEMAPS.??? files. In short you're confusing the
	  program.
	  Determine which map files are the ones you want to play and clean up
	  the directory.
	- One more error which I cannot attribute to anything I know can
	  occur.
	  It happens when you die for the first time on a level. Wolfenstein
	  kicks out with this message:
	  'MM_GetPtr: Out of Memory!'
	  This can occur in spite of the fact that the level has few actors or
	  objects and there's plenty of RAM around.
	  If you know how to fix it or what the cause is let me know.
	  That problem have been fixed in Wolf3d version 1.4.

4.4 MAP/GRAPHICS FILES VERSION CONVERSION.

Map files version conversion:
	Wolfmap 1.6 can convert between any version of Wolfenstein map files.
	Maps for versions 1.1 and higher are considered equivalent.
	Note though that not all wall panels map directly to the same panels
	through this conversion. In particular the false door of v1.0 has been
	removed and after conversion to v1.1 will appear as a mud-wall which
	will cause you problems if the maps were only the 1-episode shareware
	which doesn't have the graphic for that wall.
	In short: don't trust the conversion. Look through the maps carefully
	to see if something has gone wrong. I suspect some objects are
	converted to 'unknown' objects as described by the editors.
	Also by using Mapedit 6.0 you can convert between versions of
	Wolfenstein 'by hand' using the individual map import / export
	facility. Just load up maps of one version, export all the levels
	to disk (one at a time). Quit the editor, restart with map files
	of a different version and import those individual levels in.
	Note: This does mean you have to have the destination version map
	file available (as a place holder for the imported maps).

Graphic files version conversion:
	No known convertors exist. If you know one let me know.
	Yes, that does mean you'll have to import all the walls etc. as GIFs
	into the version of the file you want.

4.5 EDITORS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE GAME AND EACH OTHER.

Mapedit, Wolfmap and Wolfedit are compatible with all versions of Wolfenstein
from 1.0 to 1.4 shareware and both of the registered releases.
Mapedit 6.0 and 8.0 will also read/write SoD files. For Wolfmap you'll need
new definition files. --> See 5.9

Wolfmap is compatible with Mapedit, but Mapedit is NOT compatible with
Wolfmap. That is, files processed by Wolfmap are not readable by Mapedit.

Sometimes the objects edited do not always appear as they should. An example
is missing sliding doors when they were placed in the map. The door vacancy is
present instead but you cannot move through it. Someone suggested that this
can by fixed by changing floor values next to the object/door in question.
You can also move the door to another place on the wall.
I know it may stuffup your design but it should help.
NOTE: Placing a deaf-floor by the door will always make it invisible. For some
reason v1.0 of Wolfenstein experiences more of these problems (?).
Also --> See 4.2

Wolfedit has no major problems with wall panel graphics. There are some
problems when it comes to objects such as lamps, dog food, guards, etc. It
seems each object has a 'size' parameter. Editing the object may overrun that
limit. Wolfedit won't let you save the file if any objects are at fault.
Curiously even editing the colour (shade) of an object may adversely affect
it. Most importantly though objects need to have a blank background. This is
denoted by the bright pink background colour in the Wolfedit editor. (Have a
look at some standard objects that came with Wolfenstein.)

4.6 HOW TO MAKE A HARDCOPY (PRINTOUT) OF THE MAPS.

I recall there are four ways.
1) Use printscreen key + graphics.com program under DOS to capture the screen
   of one of the map editors.
2) Use Wolfmap's ASCII map dump feature. Then print it as any file. There are
   also other utilities for that. --> See 5.9
3) Capture map screen under Windows and print it later (costly on ribbon or
   toner since in bitmap mode).
4) Use a TSR screen shot utility such as PCX-Dump to dump a screen from one
   of the editors. Then print it as you would a graphics file.
NOTE: If you only want maps to original Wolfenstein then there are some
      already made. --> See 5.9

5.0 WOLFENSTEIN ADD-ON SECTION.
==============================================================================

All of the programs listed in this section can be found on the two ftp sites
mentioned in Section 0.7
I will not include anything herein until it finds its way to either of these
two sites.

Version number in square brackets indicates which version of Wolfenstein you
will need with the specific programs listed. Also archive file extensions were
omitted (.zip .arj etc.) unless they differentiate two different add-ons
with otherwise same archive name.
For example: [1.2 S] means version 'The shareware version 1.2'.

I have also included my own rating (number of *'s). This is merely my opinion
of the maps/graphics originality/artwork & bloodbath factor.
* = tame/yawn, ***** = suicidal!/wicked!

Note: The shareware version of Wolf3D has been ranked '*' for bloodbath
factor at Death incarnate level to compare with ratings given to other maps
at the same level. This is in no way to hint at its playability and is just
for comparison purposes.
Remember versions 1.2 to 1.4 are equivalent!

To install any of the maps/graphics sets, just ensure you have the correct
version of Wolf3D and copy the files that came with the archive into your
Wolf3D directory (unless specifically stated otherwise. See below or
documentation that came with the add-on if any.)

Lastly if anyone knows of anymore maps etc. let me know eh?

5.1 OLD LEVELS.

- map1 [1.0 S] * - Only level 1 was appreciably changed from
		  original maps.

- newwmap [1.0 S] ** - Maps are the same as original. Only more
		  guards were added.

- wlfnwmap [1.0 S] ** - All levels were changed. Levels 4,6,7 & 8
		  are very short & differ only in wall color.

- wlfset11 [1.0 S] *** - Extension Set One v1.1. All levels apart
		  from 1, 4 & 10 were designed from scratch.
		  Docs included.

- wolfmap [1.0 S] *** - All levels are different from original.
		  Quite challenging.

- nitemare [1.0 S] *** - Enigma's Nitemare I. Level 1 was greatly
		  changed. Others redesigned from scratch.
		  This one for really trigger happy!

- enite-ii [1.2 S] **** - Enigma's Nitemare II. This archive contains
		  maps + graphics replacements. All maps
		  different from original. Graphics cool.
		  Self-(de)installation (but you can bypass it
		  if you're paranoid about viruses etc.).
		  Intro + docs.

- enite3fx [1.2 S] ***** - This is the third installment of Enigma's
		  Nitemare. In this package you'll find all 3
		  nitemare parts (many bugs corrected) plus the
		  graphics file as well.
		  This archive has a full intro/installation
		  with it so you need not mess with renaming
		  the files. Read the doc before you start.
		  For Wolf3D experts that one...

- enm3-v30 [1.2 S] ***** - This is the same as enite3fx but has some
		  more bugfixes. You should really get this
		  instead of any other Enigma maps.

- wolf316 [1.2 R] ** - First 30 maps were redesigned. This one quite
		  'mazey'. This archive also includes new
		  graphics file replacement. Guards have been
		  replaced with men in shirts + ties. All nazi
		  symbolism was replaced by 3:16 symbolism
		  (3:16 is a drug of some sort - the game now
		  has a drug cult worship of some kind).
		  Food etc. replaced with the drug itself.
		  Digitised sounds were also changed.
		  Weapons changed to lasers now.

- darkmap1 [1.0 S] *** 1/2 - DarkStar's Castle Wolfenstein-3D levels.
		  All levels redesigned from scratch.
		  Quite a toughie this one.

- w3d_cc1 [1.2 R] **** - A total of 58 new maps (2 secret levels were
		  left unchanged). Not as hard as the Nitemare
		  series but nevertheless very enjoyable.

- sodblst2 [SoD R] **** - Blast Brothers' Spear of Destiny levels.
		  Level 1 greatly extended and all others
		  redesigned from scratch.

- sod_cc1 [SoD R] **** - All 21 levels either partially or completely
		  redesigned. Does a great job in keeping up
		  the 'spirit' of the original levels.

- insanity [1.2 R] ***** - Temporary Insanity. By Nathaniel Rudiak-Gould.
		  What can I say, these levels are truly insane.
		  Enter 30 levels of mystery where pushing the
		  wrong wall or firing a shot can spell ...
		  Doom (no pun intended :).
		  These maps use various undocumented features
		  of Wolfenstein's engine to come up with a
		  variety of effects such as:
		  walk through walls/objects, self-moving wall
		  blocks, invisible enemies, areas where you
		  move uncontrollably, 'insanity areas' which
		  make you lose your m/gun, red hot walls,
		  unopenable doors, force fields, areas only
		  accessible on certain difficulty levels etc.
		  et al.
		  So if you love solving riddles this one is
		  definitely for you. It has a large (120K)
		  hint file with it if you get frustrated.
		  WARNING: This is definitely not for all
		  you "wham! bam! thank you 'mam" type action
		  hero folks who like getting 100% stats every
		  time. This one will require some brain power.

- xmasswlf [1.2 S] ****1/2 - The maps themselves will remind you of the
		  originals. The characters, however, have
		  been replaced with crazy Santas and Snowball
		  throwing snowman. Sounds have changed too.
		  Great Stuff.

- wolfen60 [1.2 R] ***** - This is basically a collection of various
		  levels floating around all rolled into
		  one 6 episode package. You'll recognise
		  a few of the levels from other add-ons.

- wolflev1 [1.1 R] (can't really rate it - I did it!) - This is my set
		   of levels - still in progress. So far, 17 levels done.

- warwolf [1.1 R] (I did it, and still early stages) - This is the
		  all-new Warhammer Wolfenstein. All graphics will be changed
		  (at the moment, a few wall panels and some of the guns are
		  done) and it will be a full 60 levels. Looking BRILLIANT!

5.2 OLD GRAPHICS.

- wolfnpac [1.0 S] ** - Replacement for the graphics file. The only
		  change is that it replaces the brown guard
		  with a 3D pacman sphere. Nice animation
		  sequence though.

- wlfnewgr [1.0 S] ** - Replacement for the graphics file. Replaces
		  ordinary wall panels with ... x-rated images.
		  This one not for the kiddies ... although not
		  greatly explicit.
		  [WARNING! this add-on may be offensive!]

- wolfus [1.2 S] *1/2 - Wolf3D U.S. All nazi symbolism replaced with
		  US symbolism.

- w3dcool [1.2 S] *** - This is basically a package that has been
		  thrown together by someone. Don't get me
		  wrong, its nice but most of the graphics come
		  from SoD or registered Wolfenstein or other
		  games like X-Wing (a few tie bombers around)
		  and some real-life people etc. Try it for
		  really weird playing environment.

- wolfbonk [1.0 S] ** - Bonkenstien3D. Some graphics changed to
		  appear more 'appealing'. Treasure replaced
		  with computer supplies. Elevators replaced
		  with moongates. Guns replaced with ...
		  joysticks (?!!)

- wolfclwn [1.2 S] **1/2 - Wolfenstein meets the Demon Clowns of Death.
		  The boring old brown SA guard replaced with
		  a colorful clown.

- wolfstf [1.0 S] **1/2 - Wolfenstein-3d Street Fighter 2.
		  All characters have been replaced with Ryu,
		  Ken, and E. Honda. For SF2 die hard fans only.

- wlfkosh1 [1.2 S] ** - Wolfenstein 3-D kosher. By: Peter Ringering
		  Make your Wolfenstein 3-D a kosher game.
		  Instead of shooting at people, you shoot at
		  objects which will shoot at you. All the gory
		  stuff was removed as well. PG-rated if you
		  like.

- 3dbusse [1.2 S] *1/2 - Some minor touches to the graphics. SS guard's
		  m/guns now eject shells. Swastikas were
		  removed. Soldiers now wear camouflage helmets
		  & boots. Guns have targeting laser dots.

- barney10 [1.0 S] *** - This the the famous Barney patch.
		  Barney is the end of episode boss. The guards
		  are replaced by Beavis & Butthead. The sounds
		  are replaced also.

- barney14 [1.2 S] *** - This the the same Barney patch for v1.1/1.4
		  of Wolf3d.

For more graphics see enm3-v30, and wolf316 in Section 5.1.

5.3 THE NEW REVIEW RATINGS.

First of all the shareware, registered, SOD levels & Total conversions
projects will be reviewed separately.
There will be 4 rating categories.
As usual have all levels been played on the hardest difficulty setting &
is reviewed out from that.

1. Level Design.

2. Difficulty.

3. Overall.

4. Graphics Design. The Graphics design character will not have any influence
   on the Overall judgement but will be rated separately.

The ratings will be from 1 to 5 stars (no more any « stars).

* = What a slimeball level.
** = OK levels no need to overheat that modem.
*** = Good solid levels but no more than average.
**** = Fine levels just missing the magic touch, definitely worth a download.
***** = OH a new MONA LISA.

5.4 NEW SHAREWARE LEVELS.

- 10levels 1.2
1. Level design. These 10 levels are not so well designed some of them are
   large in design, they do have a feeling of the original s/w levels which
   definitely not is a bad thing. The secrets are some nasty traps though.
   **
2. Difficulty. These levels are good defended by a large horde, let the
   chaingun loose. Not as hard as the Enigma levels but nearly. ***
3. Overall. If you like a tough game of wolf this is a must. **
4. Graphics design. Only new walls from SoD. **

- Invasion 1.2

- Nazirds3 1.2
1. Level design. These 10 levels lacks identity, they mainly contains long
   corridors with small & large rooms on the sides. Also horizontal stripes
   occurred on level 3. **
2. Difficulty. Definately easier than original wolf. **
3. Overall. I find these levels boring, maybe newbies can find something here.
   **
4. Graphics design. Just 2 or 3 walls an some new small obstacles. **

- Neowlf1 1.2

- Mrwolf01 - 08 1.2

- Cmapset1 1.2

- Wolfnpth 1.2
1. Level design. At least some of the levels are taken from the Enigma set,
   the levels are quite large & generally well designed. ****
2. Difficulty. These 10 levels are named "no place to hide", it fits allright
   save often & be prepared to very many enemies plus a lot of stiff
   resistance. *****
3. Overall. Even hardened Wolf veterans will get a worthy challenge here, not
   for suited for newbies. ****
4. Graphics design. It includes a new guard, a new dog, & a new boss. Lots
   of new walls doors, e.t.c. It fits in good. ***

- Wolfra 1.2
1. Level design. Wolf Red Alert these 6 levels are set in in the cold war
   50'ties in Russia. These levels are good designed, if you know the s/w
   wolf levels you should be able to recognize parts of some of the levels.
   Apart from some "deaf" guards on level 1 that didn't react even when shot
   on, everything but that slightly nuisance i will say i enjoyed it to the
   end. ****
2. Difficulty. Don't spare the trigger on your gun, these levels are quite
   hard to complete. Good varied use of the enemies, i had to bite the dust
   several times. ****
3. Overall. Don't miss this one it seems that a lot of effort went into these
   levels, it can be seen this is a quality package. ****
4. Graphics design. Be prepared for a lot of red colors, some new russian
   samples have been added too. Don't ask me what they say, my Russian
   sucks :) just shoot the bastards. ****

- Darkstar 1.2
  This is the Darkstar levels upgraded to the wolf 1.2 level format. See
  Darkmap1 in the old levels section for more info.

- Cst-v12 1.2
1. Level design.
2. Difficulty.
3. Overall.

- Scr2000 1.2
1. Level design. 5 new levels who range from small to medium sized, ok
   designed but nothing special. ***
2. Difficulty. Not that hard. ***
3. Overall. Ok for a quick game. ***
4. Graphics design. I guess you'll have to be a fan of the scream movies to
   like this set, a new vgagraph file is included too. **

- Doomsday 1.2

- levels1 1.0
1. Level design. Level 1. Hm a lot of deaf guards, not much of fighting. Just
some small secrets even easier than the shareware levels, fairly short too.
Level 2. Bigger rooms & halls, introduction to the gatling gun & a small
secret room filled up with health. Again not much resistance, a walk in the
park. Level 3. Now were cooking get the big gun ready, lot's of SS guards,
dogs & brown guards. Hey Hans is there too, i won't reveal too much only this
use that save button. ***
2. Difficulty. As tame & boring the first 2 levels are they could really be a
lot better if they were spiced up with some more enemies.
Now it's level 3, that saves the day it's really filled with action + a nice
ending. **
3. Overall. It could be better but the 3 levels are enjoyable, so for a quick
game this is an allright package to download. ***

- Newolf11 1.2
1. Level design. Im happy that there are only 4 levels to play, it's in the
   same style as the graven levels. Wide levels with hordes of enemies
   crammed together in 2 or 3 places. **
2. Difficulty. Talk about overkill, get godmode on fast or you'll be dead 5
   times in 10 seconds. *****
3. Overall. There is nothing positive to say about this package, oh 1 thing
   it's a pleasure to delete it. **

- W3dxlv11 1.2
1. Level design. Only 1 new level, it's loosely based on the first map but
   is quite extended with lots of new surprises. ****
2. Difficulty. Quite a tough level to complete, with sneaky placements of
   the different enemies. ****
3. Overall. What a nice surprise, if you have 10 minutes left dl this goodie.
   ****

- Wolfmm14 1.2
1. Level design. These are 10 clever designed levels with lots of secrets,
   a big maze is there you may not find the solutions to get through to the
   exit on all the levels. I find a good challenge. ***
   Fixes & changes.
   On the first level i added a gold key, as there was no way to get out &
   explore the level. The other problem was the secret where the block moved
   too far & blocked the entrance, i solved this partially by placing a purple
   block with bloodstain next on the right to it. Fixed another secret so it
   wouldn't be stopped by a wall & block the entrance. Put in the chaingun &
   some ammo on the first floor plus some more health on level 1. Now you at
   least stand a chance against the 2 bosses. Changed the gold key on level 1
   to an bloodpool.
2. Difficulty. If you liked the Enigma levels you will get a worthy competitor
   here. On a level there are 4 bosses, expect to see Hans a lot of times.
   *****
3. Overall. Enjoy these very tough levels, which require both some thinking &
   quick reactions to avoid the bullets. Don't forget the save button. ***

- Wolfv1 1.2

1. Level design.
2. Difficulty.
3. Overall.

- Wolfnuke
1. level design. The 10 levels are based on schools, in theory this could work
   but in in practice a bad idea. Long corridors lot's of small rooms, sorry
   these levels needs much more variation. On the 1st level i saw a whole line
   of non reacting guards & dogs. **
2. Difficulty. About the same as normal s/w wolf. ***
3. Overall. If you choose to dl this 1 do it for the graphics not for the
   levels. **
4. Graphics design. The graphics are following a theme involving nuclear
   weapons, new doors, walls, items & lot's more. ****

- Wolfplum
1. Level design. Here comes 10 classic or rather 8 designed levels. More on
   that later. Classic in that retrospect they follow the sw levels such as,
   heavely defended keys, boss only appears on boss level. Sometimes the maker
   of these levels cram about 30 guard in 1 room, luckily not too much. The
   levels themself are just too boring level 8 is just 1 short corridor with
   a few turns, level 10 is 2 rooms & an elevator. More different walls than
   the old dull gray wall would have lightened it up but no, yawn. **
2. Difficulty. Tougher than normal wolf, lot's of ammo & health is thrown in.
   ****
3. Overall. Maybe i should have been nice in judgement, i won't a lousy boss
   level & level 8 & 10, plus clumsy placements of furnitures lack of
   variation doesn't help. **

- Wolfgottspear 1.2
1. Level design. These 6 levels are generally very big in design, exspect some
   small labyrinths good varied levels. ****
2. Difficulty. These levels are for the wolf hardasses, neatly placing of the
   enemies. ****
3. Overall. Good tough big levels what's more to say, just get it. ****
4. Graphics design. More in the gore category, some nice walls. **

- Trial 1.0
1. Level design. The designer of of these levels definetely wanted to be sure
   that you would get to the boss level, which is level 10. There are at least
   3 entries on differents levels to it, this is by far the worst level with
   1 large hall crammed with enemies which are resulting in the "disappering
   bodies" phenomenon. Luckily this ain't repeating on other levels, on some
   levels you will ocassionally meet big groups of enemies. The levels are big
   a bit too much of that boring gray wall, otherwise than that no complaints.
   ***
2. Difficulty. Nice tough levels with a sufficient supply of food & ammo. ****
3. Overall. On level 4 i had to remove 1 door to get a playable level & fix 2
   floor codes. Good solid level design except for the boss level. ***

- Cr1 1.0
1. Level design. It's the same designer who made the Trial level who is the
   mind behind these 10 levels. Ok the bad parts first, there are no enemies
   on level 6, level is caotic with rooms crammed up with enemies just
   standing until you fire the first shot &, disappearing bodies everywhere.
   The other levels contains large rooms & big corridors with lot of space.
   **
2. Difficulty. More easy to complete than the Trial levels. ***
3. Overall. If it hadn't been for the 2 levels & the boring gray walls again
   they would have gotten 3 stars, but no. **
4. Graphics design. Just a few boring walls. *

- Cr2 1.0
1. Level design. As usual the tenth level is the boss level, they are in the
   same style as the sw levels. They change from small to big in size, yeah
   new wall colours apart from 1 place the overcrowding problem with enemies
   is over. ***
2. Difficulty. The same as Cr1. Exspect some nasty surprises on level 10. ***
3. Overall. It's the best levels out of the 3 sets the designer has made maybe
   a bit too easy access to the elevator on 1 or 2 floors. I had to remove
   some mudwalls on level 2 after upgrading it. ***
4. Graphics design. Just a few boring walls. *

- Wolf1 1.2
1. Level design. The 9 levels are big levels, with lot's of big rooms & hall-
   ways. Level 4 was a nice surprise, an outdoor level. There is no new secret
   level. ***
2. Difficulty. Some tough battle with enough ammo & health. ****
3. Overall. Only on level 1 did i find some totally deaf guards, some more
   decorations in the rooms could have been nice. ***
4. Graphics design. Only minor changes on Hans Grosse, a new vgagraph file
   containing a intro picture. Don't enter the read this! menu or the game
   will crash. **

- Grosse 1.2
1. Level design. With the exception of the secret level are all the others an
   extended version of the sw set. The changes are nicely done, but tends to
   get a bit boring as you will recognize the levels. The secret level shows
   that the designer can make a good level from scratch. It is quite big &
   very well done, a penetrable door made by accident on the way to the
   silver key was the only very small nuisance. ***
2. Difficulty. A lot harder than the sw wolf set. ****
3. Overall. The secret level saves this set. ***

- School 1.2
1. Level design. Schoolstein. The 1st level is an outdoor level with a few
   annoying invisible rooms &, lot's of free space. Level 1 - 4 are fairly
   short, the other levels are medium sized. Level 10 which is the boss level
   seems to be a lot inspired of e5l4, in design nothing new on the secret
   level which is level 9, apart from extra soldiers and a elevator. ***
2. Difficulty. As normal wolf.
3. Overall. Apart from a lot of def guards which i easely surprised, otherwise
   no complaints. ***
4. Graphics design. 2 new weapons, a lot of wall & images designed to look
   like a school & a new boss. ****

5.5 NEW REGISTERED LEVELS.

- Gldeye 1.2
1. Level design. Enter 4 very well designed levels, with good hidden secrets.
   ****
2. Difficulty. With the absence of the chaingun (well i couldn't find it).
   There are plenty of enemies on level 4 i learned a new way to kill.
   Literally killing through columns. The are hard to complete & offers a
   good variety of enemies. ****
3. Overall. I can't wait to see more levels from this guy, it was without any
   expectations i downloaded the file. boy what a nice pleasance it turned out
   to be. ****

- Wolfndie 1.2
1. Level design. Meet 10 good levels, they are quite big & some of them are
   a bit mazey. On level 4 the horizontal stripe bug appeared, a bit
   irritating otherwise than that expect good varying levels. ***
2. Difficulty. Some harder than the original wolf3d levels, with a hard
   showdown on level 10. ****
3. Overall. Good, big, varying levels with a good challenge. Well worth down-
   loading. ****

- Wlf_3d 1.2
1. Level design. I have mixed feelings about these 7 levels, the levels ain't
   nothing special but the placement of secrets, same keys placed 2 different
   places on several the levels seems stupid. Level 6 could not be played the
   error message "too many static items" came out every time. **
2. Difficulty. No harder than original wolf. ***
3. Overall. Maybe something for wolf newbies, there are plenty of ammo &
   health the keys will be easy to find. **

- Wolf3d2 1.2
1. Level design. Yuck these levels or i should rather say attempts. The guy
   who have tried to design seems to have played a bit around with an editor
   for fun but never finished the job. Just forget about playing them, only 1
   level i found containing a huge maze was made acceptable. Various bugs as
   the Heisen-bug horizontal stripes were it was so bad that the game
   crashed. *
2. Difficulty. A bit harder than original wolf, with lost of disappearing
   bodies & objects. ****
3. Overall. I can't recommend these levels to anyone, just forget about them.
   *

- Fuhrerhideout 1.2
  Arrgh some people won't learn it, get maphead.wl6 in your packed file or
  the game won't run. Both Wolfmap & Mapedit couldn't read the gamemaps.wl6
  David Lummis Wolfmap refused to print out a map, so i consider it to be
  corrupt. I am contacting the author about these problems & hope to could
  review it soon.

- Bunker11 1.2
1. Level design. This 10 levels set have out since 94. Level 1 is very unlike
   any other level i have seen, it's made with outdoor scenery & seems to be
   an introduction to the castle you're about to enter. Another highlight is
   the secret level, which is a thinking man's level with plenty of action.
   All the levels are unique from another, great job. ****
2. Difficulty. Good hard action all the way. ***
3. Overall. Good levels, lot's of traps & a mystery level. ****
4. Graphics design. Just some SoD walls, & some new walls. **

- Barwolf 1.2

- Bjw60 1.2

- Bjw60ii 1.2

- Overkill 1.2
1. Level design. Wow 10 really good levels, if you liked the original wolf
   levels this is a pleasure to play. *****
2. Difficulty. Hard battle all the way, use that save button on level 9 for
   a rockhard battle. ****
3. Overall. I wish there were a lot more levels like these. *****

- Beltran 1.2

- Clonewar 1.2

- Coolwolf 1.2

- Nuclear 1.2

- Nurnberg 1.2

- Rotzi 1.2

- Mortalk 1.2

- Graven 1.2
1. Level design. These levels reminds me of the ones in the wolf3d2.zip.
   Wide levels filled with enemies packed in big crowds 2 or 3 places, just
   waiting for the first shot to be fired. Lot's of disappearing bodies
   didn't make things any better. **
2. Difficulty. No harder than original wolf. ***
3. Overall. Only the bit of level design saves this from the slimeball
   marking. I would rather play Minesweeper for 5 hours than playing these
   levels again. **

- Kw 1.2
1. Level design. Operation KnightWolf. These 5 levels are quite big, the
   author have made a great job of making them both different & interesting.
   Some long corridors, maybe a little mazey but not too much. ****
2. Difficulty. No harder than original wolf at it's hardest, a good challenge
   ***
3. Overall. What can i say just dl this baby. ****
4. Graphics design. A new slightly altered gun, new sounds, new walls yuck
   i dislike the green wall used in the secret level. There's new ghosts too.
   ***

- Wolf_run 1.2
1. Level design. As stated in the file_id.diz, it's "run n' gun" in the castle
   it descripts the levels fairly good. Easy & not too complicated to find out
   of. A lot of squased images & walls, it looks downright ugly. There's a
   loop in one of the episodes when going to the secret level, also one of the
   endings let's you hang in a wall so no end stats. **
2. Difficulty. Definetly harder than normal wolf. ****
3. Overall. Maybe something for the newbies but not for me. **

- Goren2 1.2

- Final 1.2

- Wolfms11 1.2

- Adam 1.2
1. Level design. There isn't much difference in these 6 levels, consisting
   mostly of long corridors with small rooms. ***
2. Difficulty. Not as hard as original wolf. **
3. Overall. For a first attempt from 9 year old kid these levels are not bad.
   On level 2 the heisen-bug occurred not serious, ok levels if you have 20
   minutes free time. ***
4. Graphics design. Not much new here appart from a bloodstained knife & a
   new machinepistol. ***

- Tank 1.2
1. Level design. Let's take the bad parts first. On E1L2 when you open a
   locked door the heisen-bug will shortly occur, on E1L9 the exit needs to be
   longer as B.J. walks right through the wall, without being able to finish
   the game & let you get the endgame stats. Also dogs around in the elevators
   allowing you to walk through doors & switches. Some of the levels are big
   yet quite confusing, most of them are quite small also labyrinths will
   appear. With all these minor bugs i can only give the 6 episodes this
   rating. ***
2. Difficulty. If it hadn't been for the bosses where i choose to use hit'n
   run tactics, whack 1 boss get the key & head for the nearest locked door
   with up to 5 bosses i don't intend to commit suicide. ****
3. Overall. Some better levels some smoothing on the toughness in the gameplay
   still some solid design. ***
4. Graphics design. Oh yes much better a new SSguard, new bosses as tanks,
   a lot of new exiciting walls, items, from which a good part is taken from
   other sets such as the dog, the weapons, also a new vgagraph file. ****

- Wolfmas 1.2
  In order to review this compilation of sw/reg levels i have placed them
  under the registered levels, so all the different sets are placed here.

5.6 SPEAR OF DESTINY LEVELS.

- Bismark 1.2

- Dmnt1 1.2

- 1st 1.2

- Sod 1.2
1. Level design. First off when about a 3rd of the levels of the set is ripped
   off from the original Wolf3D, it's ok to build on them but just putting
   more guards in there that's too cheap. **
2. Difficulty. No harder than normal SoD. ***
3. Overall. **
4. Graphics Design. Just some walls & bosses ripped from the Wolf3D Vswap file
   Try something new. *

- Bnsodnew 1.2
1. Level design. Enter 5 very tough levels, that follows the spirit from SoD,
  the 5 levels are good designed. ****
2. Difficulty. On 1 level be prepared to meet 8 bosses. *****
3. Overall. If pain is your name, you'll get IT. ***

- Sodmet12 1.2

5.7 TOTAL CONVERSIONS.

- Arm 1.2

- Totenp 1.2
1. Level design. Wow these 21 levels are definitely a masterpiece, i come to
   think about SoD. They build up a mood, i actually like them more than the
   original wolf levels. *****
2. Difficulty. Well you asked for a very hard battle and you'll get it. *****
3. Overall. This is brilliant work, i got the chills more than 1 time,
   sweating with with my heart pounding wild. DON'T miss this 1.
4. Graphics design. New guards, bosses walls, doors, new guns, & much more.
   *****
5. Sc changes. New cheat codes, max health increased to 150% health.
   47 brand new levels (27 in Phase 1, 20 in Phase 2).
   New art and sound effects from various sources and my
   own design.
   One massive episode with seamless level flow.
   Changed ceiling colors.
   Changed music order (and addition of several Spear of
   Destiny selections).
   Two new keys (the bronze key and the elevator keycard).
   with icons on the status bar.
   Chainguns that occasionally jam, requiring you to find
   a new one.
   Non game-terminating bosses.
   Lot's more.

- Hr 1.2

- Tsdt 1.2

- 2nd 1.2

- Panzer16b 1.2

- Hitler12 1.2

- 2 1.2

- S2000 1.2

- Bomb 1.2
1. Level design. The 10 levels are loosely based on the original s/w levels
   although the secret level, is a rip-off from episode 2's boss level. Also
   level 6 is a ripoff from episode 5, level 2. A bit more originality could
   be wished for. ***
2. Difficulty. No harder than original wolf. ***
3. Overall. The levels are fairly short, but quite good, definitely worth a
   try. ***
4. Graphics design. A new weapon & some doors & walls are taken from Operation
   Panzershciff. A new mini boss is in there too. ***
5. Sc changes. Removal of deathcam, up to 115% health, up to 150, new opening
   scene. It is irritating that you can pick up all the health & ammo you want
   even when filled up, the game have a bad habit of loosing sound at least 1
   time on each level i lost the sound.

- Sr 1.2
1. Level design. If you liked the original set, you should enjoy these 55
  levels. On e2l1 the game crashed several times in the room with the gold
  key, with the following message. SD_playSound() - Zero length sound. ****
2. Difficulty. No harder than normal wolf. ***
3. Overall. Various small bugs in the game screen, such when having more than
   100% in health a small square with changing numbers would pop up at B.J.'s
   face. So only. ***
4. Graphics design. New soldier, new walls, items, bosses, great stuff. Except
   for the new double machinegun. ****
5. Sc changes. ability to get 199% health.
   Ability to get 999 bullets.
   Ability to pick up 2 machine guns and use them.
   More health power-ups.
   Officer and mutant drop 8 bullets.
   Ss always drop machine gun.
   Dr. Schabbs is tougher.
   Some cheats.
   Powerful new shotgun.

- Srswolf

- Srswolf2

- Srwolf

- Chokage
1. Level design. Good varied levels they are made in style as the wolf s/w
   levels. ****
2. Difficulty. No harder than normal wolf. ***
3. Overall. If you like your game with lot's of humour this is a definitely
   must see. *****
4. Graphics Design. Be prepared to meet Homer Simpson, the "electrifying dog"
   & lots of other surprises. Excellent use of new crazy sounds. *****

- B2wolfse 1.2

- Rtw 1.2

- Westwall 1.2

5.8 NEW GRAPHICS.

- Alienwlf 1.2
1. Level design. As stated in the .txt file, it is sample levels indeed 1 of
   the maps will crash the game. The map design is average & no more. ***
2. Difficulty. No harder than Wolf3D. ***
3. Overall. ***
4. Graphics design. This is some of the best i have seen, making the game
   harder a must see. *****

- Pacnclwn 1.2
1. Level design. Good medium sized levels, with a few surprises which i won't
   reveal. If you like the big sw levels then these levels are ok. ***
2. Difficulty. No harder than Wolf3D. ***
3. Overall. Ok levels to dl, but i would get for the graphics. ***
4. Graphics design. Some new sounds added otherwise the 2 files wolfclwn &
   wolfnpac have been upgraded to version 1.4 then merged. Yikes that boss is
   ugly. ****

- Hlloween 1.2

- Tsdt 1.2

- Lost-ep
1. Level design. This is a set i have been loking forward to review. The
   levels are very slick done, they generally big with lot's of traps, &
   a good feel. *****
2. Difficulty. No harder than sw wolf, plenty of ammo & health. ***
3. Overall. I don't want to spoil anything for you just grab it. *****
4. Graphics design. Everything is designed here i like it a lot. ****

- Obcwolf 1.2
1. Graphics design. Actually there are 10 levels but it's omly the sw levels
   & they keeps crashing. The graphics are from the game Operation Bodycount,
   plus some sounds too. Nicely done. ***

- Fon 1.2
1. Level design. This set only contains 1 level. It contains some consecutive
   rooms with some close combat near the end of the level, there are 2 large
   halls 1 of them reminded me of SoD level 10 with Wilhem Barnacle. ****
2. Difficulty. Maybe a tad harder than wolf. ****
3. Overall. I'm looking forward to the next levels if they are as good as
   this. ****
4. Graphics design.

- Spacestn 1.2
1. Level design. This a project in work there are only 2 regular levels, the
   secret level & level 3 will end the game. The 2 levels are very big, some
   of the dogs are running on the same spot. There are many good surprises,
   just try to hide the secrets better once the pattern is found then it's
   too easy. ***
2. Difficulty. Stop polishing that chaingun NOW!! SHOOT. ****
3. Overall. Hopefully more levels will be added a nice surprice. ***
4. Graphics design. Some of the graphics are taken from Alienwolf, some good
   walls. I think there's more to come. ***

- Megawolf 1.2

5.9 OTHER ADD-ONS & UTILITIES.

		     game to upgrade from version 1.0 to 1.1.

- w6patch [1.2 R] - This is the map upgrade for the full version
		    (6 episode) to version 1.2. Note though that
		    this is not an official patch that will fix
		    your version to say 1.2. Only the corrected
		    map files (since this is an only difference
		    between v1.1 & 1.2 anyway).

- wcheat [1.0 S] - Edit Wolf3D save game files. Add ammo,
		   health, guns, etc.

- winwolf [N/A] - Some BMP files of graphics from the game.

- wolfspk4.exe [All S & R] - This little utility will redirect digitised
			     sounds in the game to the PC speaker.
			     (For all of you people with no soundcard!)
			     Some sounds come out a bit dodgy but all the
			     shooting & screaming is audible. This file
			     also works with Spear of Destiny. Note: there
			     are other files like this e.g. wolfspk3.exe,
			     wolfspk.exe, wolf1spk.exe, but wolfspk4.exe
			     supersedes them. To revert back to PC
			     quicker sounds delete CONFIG.WL? file.

- wolfsnd [1.1 Reg(6)] - This is a little utility for exporting &
			 importing digitised sounds from the VSWAP.WL6
			 file. Reads/writes VOC files. Must have the
			 full 6 episode version.

			    decimal) for all objects contained in the
			    various graphics files.

- wlfaud11 [All S] - Audio Editor v1.1
		     Utility by Bill Neisius to export/import
		     digitised samples from/to shareware versions
		     of Wolfenstein. Will accept many formats
		     (.AU, .VOC, .WAV, .SND etc.)
		     Doesn't seem to handle ALL the sounds found in
		     the VSWAP.WL1 file (first 20 I think).

- allwolfsodmaps - All Wolf3D and SoD maps (by Frans de Vries)
		   Contains a small Unix routine to print them
		   on separate pages. These WILL work on UNIX
		   & DOS boxes. Created using wmap41 and the
		   following add-on:

- allwolfsodmapdefs - New definition files for the Wolfmap editor
		      (works with Mapedit v4.1 & v6.0 too :) and
		      the wmap41 ASCII dump utility. Standardizes
		      the legends, adds Spear definitions, improves
		      a few colors and adds missing objects/walls.

- ultwlf13  [?.? ?] - Patches wolf for GUS support. Digitised
		  sounds will be redirected to your GUS in
		  native mode (No SBOS). Additionally some nice
		  MOD soundtracks will play in the background.

- map4wol3
Full Sod & Wolf3d all versions support, produces ascii maps i like it better
than wmap.

- wolfmp
Full Sod & wolf3d support, It have the advantage that the maps can be fully
viewed on the screen. Got a large variety of commandline options, my personal
favorite when i want to make ascii maps.

- wolfexe
The file contained in this zip file is a new executable for Wolfenstein 3D. It
makes it easier to cheat. It does not require you to use any special
parameters when starting up nor do you have to use any special debug codes.
All you have to do is get into actual gameplay where you can see your gun, and
then press the letter of what ever cheat you want, you don't even have to
press the tab key. Here is how to use it:

Unzip wolfexe.zip to your Wolfenstein 3D folder so it overwrites your current
wolf3d.exe.
Start the new wolf3d.exe and open a new or saved game.
Press one of the following keys:
(please keep in mind that you no longer have to press the tab key with these.)

K -- GET ALL KEYS. *
N -- NO CLIPPING! NOW THAT I HAVE EDITED THE EXECUTABLE IT WORKS IN VERSION
     1.4 *

SIMULTANIOUSLY PRESS Z, N, and L AND YOU WILL GET 100% HEALTH, 99 AMMO, BOTH
KEYS, AND 0 POINTS. *

* Changed or added cheat.

6.0 WOLFENSTEIN SPECIFIC PROBLEMS & BUGS (known to date).
	AND HOW TO FIX OR GET AROUND THEM.
==============================================================================

6.1 HARDWARE PROBLEMS.

- Sound FX all screwed or cut out (SB + compat only).
	If your sounds are short or hang the machine shortly into the game
	then most likely you have an IRQ mismatch on your soundcard. Try
	changing it. Good values are 5 & 7.
	Also try DMA channel change, although #1 (default) should be ok.
	... and don't forget to set your BLASTER variable in DOS like this:
	(Best to put this in AUTOEXEC.BAT)

	SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T4
		     ^^^  ^  ^  ^
	A=??? port number for your soundcard.
	I=? interrupt number for your soundcard.
	D=? DMA channel number for your soundcard.
	T=? Type of your sound card (must consult manual).
	99% of the time you'll only need to fiddle around with I & T.
	NOTE: the values pointed at may be different for you.
	Consult your SB & Computer manual.
	As far as I know T4=SB Pro & T3=Regular Sb.
	Dunno About others (anyone?).

- You get some weird graphics on the screen then later the games hangs.
	a) Change your SB IRQ number. Some graphics cards will clash with
	   it (Don't ask me why, it could help...)
	b) If your system is VLB you might try a newer Wolfenstein version.
	   Try version 1.4 (since version 1.0 has a video problem)

6.2 SOFTWARE PROBLEMS.

- Game hangs. Sound hangs on last note.
	Try getting rid of some TSRs.
	Also some EMM managers can cause the problem with older versions of
	Wolfenstein.
	v1.2 is notorious for hanging under EMM386.EXE. The problem is
	apparently related to VGA card compatibility. It seems some of the
	earlier HiColor cards (15/16 bit RAMDACs) do not coexist peacefully
	with Creative Labs. SB products. Some of the early SB chips are posing
	some problems too.
	If Wolfenstein hangs with EMM386 with EMS enabled (/RAM option) then
	try the /NOEMS switch. If still no joy then try only HIMEM.SYS with
	no EMM386 (extended memory only).

- Game hangs or refuses to run with memory problems.
	If you have DR-DOS 6.0 + QEMM with stealth then disable stealth mode.
	Wolfenstein doesn't quite agree with it.

- Game hangs at the 'Get Psyched' screen.
	Err, you probably mixed some version numbers and have a very messy
	directory with 999 add-on maps installed. Wolfenstein won't like that.

- Game hangs with some horizontal stripes through the status bar.
	- Heisen-bug, a glitch. Mostly with the add-on maps.
	  Reboot, probably won't happen again.
	- Also happens if you mixed versions of the VSWAP.??? file and of the
	  game itself. Make sure you have the appropriate version of the game.
	  Sometimes the stripes will be there even after you have finished a
	  level. Hit F5 shrink the screen 1 time, go back to the game hit F5
	  enlarge the screen 1 time now the stripes will almost every time be
	  gone.

- Game seems to run but all you can see is some weird graphics.
	- Must have got a slightly corrupt VSWAP.??? file. Hope you have
	  a backup somewhere (Nya Nya Nya!)
	- You cheater! You tried to go above the last level 10 with the TAB-W
	  cheat. Ha! (Yes this IS possible with some versions).
	- Err, if you edited that map then you forgot to place level entrance
	  somewhere (duh).

6.3 GAME SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.

- 'DISAPPEARING BODIES' phenomenon. This occurs when there are so many enemies
  in your view at a time that the game stops displaying some. The game engine
  as it seems is limited to only so many "sprites". Anything beyond that and
  you won't be sure which guys will start disappearing. This only occurs on a
  couple of levels in Wolfenstein I think. Be aware if you are editing your
  own map! There is no fix. The engine is set and id won't rework it.

- 'DISAPPEARING OBSTACLES' phenomenon. Basically like the disappearing bodies,
  this can happen e.g. colums. However it's rarely seen.

- 'MISSING SOUND' phenomenon. Usually this happens when a fighting with a big
  horde of enemies, you will hear that the sound becomes sporadic most times
  it will come back when the enemies are dead. Fighting a boss will nearly
  trigger this every time, if you can't get the sound back go out in the
  game menu hit enter on the "go back to game". This will solve the problem.

- 'PUSHWALL MOVES TOO FAR' phenomenon. This is when the pushwall (or secret
  door if you prefer) moves TOO FAR and blocks your further passage into the
  room full of goodies etc. I cannot recall if there is one in episode one,
  but apparently there are at least two places where this occurs in episode 6.

  Episode 6, level 2. This is the FIRST pushwall in the map. All others on
  this level are *behind* it.

  This is shown below:

before pushing:
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWW   W   WWW
		?*  WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW

after pushing:
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWW   W   WWW
		 ?   *  WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW

  You are where the '*' is, and you push the pushwall '?'.
  'W' is other parts of walls.
  It's supposed to move two grid locations and stop, so you can go around it.
  Instead, it moves three, and blocks everything.

  NOTE: This does not always happen. That is, sometimes the pushwall will move
	2 grid locations, i.e. correctly.
	Also any interference from guards behind it is not connected with this
	since that would prevent pushwall moving at all or impede it to move
	only 1 grid location.

  Solution: Well, it looks like there isn't one at the moment.
  There was a suggestion of inserting "stacks 9, 256" in the config.sys file,
  but this doesn't seem to help.
  The only suggestion is to save frequently and if you experience the problem,
  to start over from the last saved position. Maybe the pushwall moves back
  correctly this time.

7.0 WOLFENSTEIN CLONES.
==============================================================================

In this section of the FAQ, I will detail the many games which Wolfenstein
has inspired. If you can't get enough Wolfenstein, get some of these! NB:
I am not including RPG type games - i.e. Shadowcaster - as these have taken
their inspiration more from Ultima Underworld.

Note: ARGH! This section could be one _huge_ mother with the huge expansion
in 3D games. I'm adding the contemporary ones more or less from memory, so
correct me if I miss any or get something wrong. This section will not include
any Doom clones or any newer games. Look for Frans P DeVries All 3D Games faq.

7.01 CATACOMB ABYSS.

This was an id game for those with EGA monitors, loosely based on the
Wolfenstein engine. It was released by Gamer's Edge, who put nowhere near the
same standard of presentation on it as Apogee would have. The sound was bad -
no SB music! However, all this aside, Catacomb Abyss is a very good game. It
introduced some new features. You fire fireballs, of which you have an
unlimited number, at the undead enemies. Ha! Undead? DEAD! You can pick up
spells, such as the machine-gun effect spell, which streams off a line of
fireballs at the enemy. The graphics are nothing to write home about -
"functional" is as far as it gets. However, this is highly recommended to
Wolfenstein fans. Also it really marked the end for commercial EGA games.

7.02 BLAKE STONE 3D.

This was the real sequel to Wolfenstein 3D. Released around the same time as
Doom (oops), it was set in a futuristic setting. Very similar to Wolfenstein,
although with more enemies, and some other new features, like food units,
"intelligent" enemies, floor mounted enemies, remote-linked doors and a cool
gun, the Plasma discharger. Basically a grenade launcher with a different
name. This is a very atmospheric game which did not get the attention it
deserved at the time, due to the release of...

7.03 VIRTUOSO.

Some longhaired rockstar is trapped inside of his room because all of his
female fans. To get the time going he is playing a game called Virtuoso.
You will see the character from behind, shoot down all sorts of big insects
collect treasures. If you can stand playing this game more than 5 minutes you
have a badder taste than me. So what is wrong with this game ? First realising
it in 1995, with uglier graphics than Wolfenstein 3D well beg for a disaster.
Uninspiring levels, tame monsters.
This is a slimeball game. (TM)

7.04 KEN'S LABYRINTH.

This was knocked up by one guy after playing Wolfenstein, and it shows. Crap.
Crap to the nth degree. Utter dog-poo. Don't waste the download time. Just
out of interest, the guy who wrote this was snapped up by Apogee (who
obviously saw more in it than I did) and went on to make the build engine.
is Ken Silverman.
Note the full version of Ken's labyrinth have been released as freeware.

7.05 HUGO'S NITEMARE 3D.

This is an interesting game, firmly in the Wolfenstein mode. It puts a more
"puzzly" face onto things. Certain guns are more effective against certain
enemies. Try it if you liked Enigma for Wolfenstein (See Wolfenstein add-ons
section).

7.07 TERMINATOR: RAMPAGE.

A commercial Wolfenstein look-alike by Bethesda Softworks. This isn't very
good, the main criticisms being that it is:
a) Too slow
b) Too complicated.
It does have a good variety of weapons, though.

7.08 CORRIDOR 7.

This is another commercial offering, by Gametek. They licensed the Wolfenstein
engine, and proceeded to totally mess it up, and produce a boring, slow,
repetitive game. Oh dear...what a wasted opportunity.

7.10 OPERATION BODYCOUNT.

See above.

8.0 WOLFENSTEIN 3D THE INTERNET SECTION.
==============================================================================

9.0 THE WOLFENSTEIN SOURCE CODE.
==============================================================================

10.0 HOW TO MAKE WOLF3D.EXE CHANGES WITHOUT COMPILING.
==============================================================================
The Wolf3d.exe is compressed with lzexe v0.91 to make it more compact. I do
not know where you can find this program, try a search engine.
Once you have gotten this program decompress Wolf3d.exe, use a hex editor to
view the Wolf3d.exe file try to search after these words, Get them!. This is
1 of the songs contained in the game. Now you could change the name to SoD.

IMPORTANT. When editing the different items in the Wolf3d.exe file do not make
the changes fill more than the original item.

Exsample given : Get them! are 9 dots long, remember spaces between the words
count too.
So the changed item must NOT exceed the original size. Otherwise funny things
can happen including crashing the game, or ugly messages completely out of
size.

Once you have changed the things you wanted, compress Wolf3d.exe with lzexe
v0.91, or you could use the freeware program upx avaliable for Dos, W9X Linux
visit their homepage here.
www.nexus.hu/upx

Here is a list of the different items which can be changed.

1. The songs titles.
2. The menu screens.
3. The episode titles.
4. The endscreen.
5. The shareware/registered screen.
6. The cheat messcages.
7. The quit yes/no messages.
8. The error messages.
9. The difficulty selection names.
10. The BAT, LIM messages.
11. The demo record message.
12. The deathcam message.

Things you can't change.

Exsample given : The par time is the time for ending a level fast, if you beat
it bonus points will be given. Now if you change the par time 02:00 you will
only change the text message not the par time selection itself, for that you
will need to compile the Wolf3d.exe file.

As you can see there are still many things that can be changed maybe only
cosmethical, anyway you can still have some fun. Good luck.

11.0 RETURN TO WOLFENSTEIN WHAT IS THAT ?.
==============================================================================
Wolfenstein 2000 is a new game under development by Xatrix games, (known for
their 3D game Redneck Rampage). It is using the Quake III engine made by id
software, they don't have anything else to do with the game as far as i know.

Here is an extract from an edited chat with the 2 id employees Paul Steed &
Tim Willits. To see the whole published chat go to this website.
www.shugashack.com/onearticle.x/3433

<moderator> <choc> how about doom 2000 & wolfenstein 3D updated any hints ?
<Willits> a version of wolfenstein using the Quake 3 is currently in
development.
<Willits> ...but not by id software, under the DIRECTION of id software.

So there you have it folks there is no release date but in a news article on
the net december 2000 was mentioned, as id said about Quake II it's finished
when it's finished.

Well the rumours continues.

So here is an edited interview with Ryan Feltrin the man behind Quake Rally,
also known as Ridah. Now working for Xatrix.

We understand that you are now working on the Return to Wolfenstein team ?
Correct.

Did id send you guys a message or the likes wishing you guys luck with the
game ?
id are involved with the design & the direction of the game. They obviously
want to make sure it stays true to it's roots, and has that "id" touch to it.

Can you tell us anything at all about the plans for Return to Wolfenstein ?
Not really, i'm afraid. I can really only acknowledge that it is being
developed, and it's progressing well.

Will RTW be a conventional first person shooter in the normal sense, or will
it bring new things to the genre, ala Duke, or Half-Life ?
I would hope it would not be remembered for being a conventional shooter, we
aren't interested in making that sort of a game.

14.0 FUTURE ADDITIONS TO THE FAQ.
==============================================================================

On the agenda are:

- More specific Boss strategies (call on info)

  Don't count on it, i've been waiting for ages :|

Too much to mention here. See subsection )--> 0.6 for more information.

15.0 FEEDBACK SUGGESTED.
==============================================================================

About 3 months ago i was out zapping on the net, i was looking for the wolf3d
faq i didn't really find it but more interestingly if found a huge homepage
crammed up with wolfenstein & some Spear Of Destiny stuff. My jaw nearly felt
down on the table lots of new maps, links, to other homepages & much more.
Wolfenstein 3D have always had a big place in my heart, and seeing much to my
surprise the wolf3d scene so vibrant and so much alive well (anyone got a
handkerchief) then i knew i had to do this FAQ to give something back to the
community.

Of course i can't tell if any of the other maintainers of this FAQ had any
contact to the wolf3d community, (it seems Stanley Stansiak had) but none of
them couldn't find or maybe didn't have the time to check this out.

The ADD-ON section will be changed a bit.
The rating system will be the same but the rewievs will reflect & concentrate
more on mentioning quality levels perhaps some more lengthy reviews and
slimeball levels (some of them will even crash wolf3d) i hate downloading them
and will be introducing TC'S, (short for Total Conversions). with lot's
of new things in them.
There will be a quality rating & a difficulty rating.

However i don't have the time to review them all, i have a life to live :=)
also other games like GTA, Age of Empires and Doom is taking some of the time.
So if you would like to review a map or 2 email them to me.
This also applies to new software like Floedit & Wolf 3D Patch launcher
Swapper V2.0.

Therefore if anyone got a link or even better a wolf3d homepage don't hesitate
to email me, be sure to check if the homepage still exists before sending me
the info.

So there! Phew!
That's the end.
Now go and play the game!

Nova, aka Bernt Hansen.
