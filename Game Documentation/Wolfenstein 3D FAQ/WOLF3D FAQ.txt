~1.4 Mb of HD space
Runs under?: OS/2: Yes
             Windows: Yes (Note if you've got a SB device driver
                           installed under windows or a windows TSR
                           like an hour chime running it may interfere
                           with some of Wolfensteins digitized sounds)
             DR DOS 6: Yes
             Compatible with: stacker: Yes (2.0 & 3.0)
                              superstor: Yes
Difficulty levels: 4
Number of stages: 10 (shareware), 30 or 60 if $ registered
                 (1 episode (part) = 10 stages)
Violence rating: PC-13 (profound carnage)
Availability: First part is shareware. Extra parts
can be ordered from the distributor (more later)
Comments: Highly addictive.

Storyline:
Basically you're a WWII allied spy imprisoned in Germany
and you're trying to escape
(full story included with the game)

2. You can ftp it from ccu.umanitoba.ca
in /pub/wolf3d/ as wolf3d14.zip or wolf3d14.exe (self extracting)
or from ftp.uwp.edu in /pub/msdos/games/id as wolf3d14.zip.
(note: ziped with pkzip v2.04g)
The archive size is ~ 750Kb
There is an unpacking installation with this latest version (1.4)
so there should be no problem with getting started.

You can also get a full version from Apogee (Id's distributor)
Info on ordering included in the shareware version.

3. You simply unzip the program (if you obtained the zip archive)
   or run it (if you have the self-extract archive).
   It will place an INSTALLATION copy of the game in the current
   directory. Just run INSTALL program supplied to install a RUNABLE
   copy on your HD.
   You can delete the INSTALLATION copy once a runable copy has been made
   (to save disk space of course).
   Note though that initially you'll need ~4Mb of HD space to unpack the game.
   You also should be able to run the game from a 3.5" HD floppy
   since the RUNABLE copy only takes ~1.38Mb. That though is unconfirmed.
        (Hey, I didn't try it!)
   

4. The most current version of Wolfstein 3D is 1.4
The newest version fixes all known bugfixes (as did 1.1 etc.)
Apart from that there is not much of a difference unless
it comes to map/graphics editors -> See 5.

5. Map/Graphics editors can be obtained from the same site as the game.

No, they are not written by Id or supported by them.
Yes, they will probably be ok for your own use (anyone from Id read this??)
No, you are not allowed to distribute modified art from the game
Nor anything from the game for $$$ unless selling the game to third party
(Legitimate registration transfer)

The editors have been obtained by reverse engineering the map/graphics
files and producing program that changed those files in a manner
consistent with the game requirements of them.

The editor archives are:
maped41.zip        map viewer/editor
wolfed21.zip       graphics viewer/editor
wolfm160.arj       map viewer/editor version convertor

The last one will let you convert between versions of wolfenstein
since the map encryption for 1.0 is not compatible with 1.1 and upwards
(and you may feel left out if you designed maps before with 1.0
 and now have 1.1 or 1.4 etc. Not so!)

Also maped41/wolfm160 will automatically detect what version of
wolfenstein you have installed so you need not worry if you don't want
to convert maps (upgrade/downgrade (!) them).

All of these files include ample docs with them, so I'm NOT
describing them here.

6. There is a document on ccu.umanitoba.ca in /pub/wolf3d/
called wolfdbug.txt that describes the various cheat options
in wolfenstein and how to access them.
I have reproduced it here.

(v1.0 means Wolf3D version 1.0 and v1.1 means Wolf3D version 1.1.
The other versions are the same as v1.1 except as noted.)

To enter the mode, do the following:

1.  Invoke Wolfenstein 3-D with the "next" parameter (wolf3d -next)
    for v1.0, or the "goobers" parameter for v1.1.  You can also use
    whatever other command-line parameters you want.

2.  Begin or restore a game.  While in the game, hold down the TAB,
    CONTROL, and ENTER keys simultaneously for v1.0, or the LEFT SHIFT,
    ALT, and BACKSPACE keys for v1.1.  You should get a message stating
    that debugging keys are now available.

That's it!

To use debugging mode commands, hold down the TAB key and one of the
letter keys listed below simultaneously:

B   Changes the screen border color.  Don't ask me why it's here, but
    it's here.

C   Displays the number of statics, doors, and actors in the level.
    Statics are things like food, ammo, pools of blood, etc., and
    actors are the bad guys.  Doors should be self-explanatory.

E   Moves you ahead two levels.  That's right, not one level, but two.
    Unlike the W command (see below), this also takes you to the "level
    completed" screen and gives you percentages, bonuses, etc.

F   Displays your current position on the level (X,Y) and orientation (A).
    To convert the X and Y values to coordinates that can be used in
    MapEdit, divide them by 65,536 and round down.  A is in degrees
    ranging counterclockwise from right.  ("Right" refers to the top view
    as seen in MapEdit.)

G   Turns what Id calls "GOD mode" on and off.  Basically it just means
    that you're invincible.  The screen still turns red when you would
    normally be hurt, though.  This can get very annoying if you want to
    do something fun like kill the episode's boss with your knife.

H   Hurts you (-16% health).  Not much use to us, but I guess Id had
    to debug their damage code just like everything else.

I   "Free items."  Ups your health, ammo, and score, and gives you the
    next most powerful weapon.  (Machine gun if you didn't have it,
    Gatling gun if you did.)

M   Displays memory usage.  Loads of fun.

N   Turns "No clipping" on or off.  This lets you walk through walls.
    Wall-walking does STRANGE things to the graphics (try approaching a
    door from the side and opening it).  It also does strange things
    to the bad guys.  If you walk into a room through the wall, often
    they won't notice you at all, even if you walk right in front of
    them or fire your machine gun (in some direction besides at them,
    of course).  This command is not available in the registered
    version of the game.  (I guess we should be glad that ANY of the
    commands are available.)

O   Changes the main viewscreen to a map of the current level, which
    you can scroll through using the movement keys or the mouse.  It's
    neat, but I wish that it weren't so ugly.  Those numbers are from
    the internal level format.  ESC will get you out.  Unfortunately
    this command doesn't work in v1.1.

P   Pauses the game, without putting up the little "Paused" window.
    I guess this makes it nice for taking a screen shot, although in
    v1.1 it changes the screen border to an ugly bright white.

Q   Bombs the machine in v1.0.  Exits the game in v1.1.  Both of these
    functions are about equally useless.

S   Turns slow motion on or off.  If you have a slow computer you
    don't need this.

T   Pops up a window which displays graphics and sounds from the game.
    Use the left and right arrow keys to page through the entries.
    If you come to a blank entry, keep going.  You'll know when you've
    reached the end (500-something) because you won't be able to go
    any higher.  ESC exits.  v1.1 has some interesting graphics that
    v1.0 lacks, including one sprite which is particularly intriguing.
    (Don't bother doing what it says; you won't win anything.)

V   Asks you how many extra VBLs you want.  High values seem to make
    the game sluggish and not much else.

W   Warps to any level.  Although it prompts for a value from 1 to 10,
    you can actually enter any number up to 20 in the registered
    version.  Eleven through twenty correspond to levels one through
    ten in the episode following the one you're currently playing.

X   "Extra stuff."  Doesn't appear to do anything.  If you can amend
    this, let me know.

Miscellaneous notes:

TEDLEVEL - You can use the "-tedlevel" command-line parameter to
quickly start Wolf3d and warp to any level.  The parameter is
followed by a two-digit number.  The tens digit is the episode number
minus one, and the ones digit is the level number minus one.  For
example, to go to level 10 of episode three, type:
    wolf3d -tedlevel 29
and to go to the first episode, level 2, type:
    wolf3d -tedlevel 1
Using this parameter also gives you an infinite number of lives.
Combine it with "-goobers" (or "-next") for even more fun.

DEMO RECORDING MODE - This "debugging" feature is not accessed in the
same way as the other commands, and it is available only in v1.0.  To
record a demo, follow step one from the beginning of this file, and
then hold down TAB at the title screen (the one with B.J. hiding from
a guard).  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to display
these demos after they've been recorded, but if you've ever had a
secret desire to play Wolfenstein 3-D with a big "DEMO" sign at the
top of the screen, this is how to do it.

SPEAR OF DESTINY - Strictly speaking, this file isn't about SOD, but
SOD's debugging mode is quite similar to Wolf3d's.  Just use the
command-line parameter "-debugmode" and the same key combo as v1.1.
Oh, and be sure to check out what happens to B.J. when you turn on
God mode...
