    {1-1} - A message from the author

  Okay, I have talked a lot with Joe Siegler(Apogee's Online Support Manager),
and (much to my embarrasment :) found that I got some things in version 1.0
TOTALLY WRONG! :) Well, He sent me some corrections, and I now am back at it
again, trying to get things right this time! :)

  I had finished version 1.5 when all new information that just couldn't be
ignored came in. So, the only people who received v1.5 was Apogee. I'm writing
this new information in, and designating this v1.6. If you have version 1.0,
remember that some of it is TOTALLY WRONG!

  As you notice from the table of contents above, EVERY SINGLE SECTION OF THIS
FAQ HAS BEEN REVISED! And I've added {2-4} - General Questions(and everthing
under that), and {3-2-1} - Contributors.


--

    {1-2} - What IS Rise of the Triad?

  Rise of the Triad is Apogee's newest 3D action game (so new, it isn't even
out yet!). Instead of some of Apogee's other programs, where you see your
character on the screen and see a portion of the screen centered around
him/her, in RotT, you see through the eyes of your character!  Your weapon is
at the bottom of the screen, and what your character sees, you see. You can
turn around and look behind you, or look up and down (up to 25 degrees either
way)  Pushing forward makes your character go forward, pushing back makes
him/her go backwards. With mastery, your character can drive around to exactly
where you want him/her to go (BTW, you notice I'm saying him/her a lot, that's
because in this game, your character can be a boy or girl of different ethnic
backgrounds (five characters to choose from).
  Rise of the Triad was originally going to be a Wolf3D sequel, and was going
to use the same engine with minimal improvements. But then iD and Apogee went
their separate ways, and Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold turned into the sequel.
Then RotT engine was completely rewritten, and this is the result: a cool game
on par with Doom. :)

--

    {1-3} - What makes it different from DOOM?


  Like in Wolfenstein or Blake Stone, RotT has 90-degree walls(Doom can go any
direction). But, as I always say(or will say from now on), you can't judge a
game by it's angles. :) Anyway, there WILL be multiple stories on your
levels(yay!) so it will be quite fun hunting your opponent on a multi-story
battle level. Other things are hazards. In DOOM, hazards consisted of crushing
ceilings or ooze pits that drained health. In RotT, there are 15 types of
hazards, including: SpinBlades, FireChutes, FireJets, PitTraps, LavaWalls,
Crushing Pillars, and Spinning Spears(these are not the official names for
the last two). Also, in RotT, instead of using iD's method of digitizing clay
models, Apogee decided to film live characters for all of their positions(Even
better, they are all Apogee employees!(except that one was at Apogee during
digitizing but has since left)) The result makes it look far better than
Blake Stone's or Wolf's characters, which are drawn.


--

    {1-4} - Who makes RotT?

  Rise of the Triad is being made by Apogee Software, who distributed some of
iD's games, including the Commander Keen series (yes, it's shocking. Commander
Keen is an iD game!). Although Apogee has distributed iD games in the past,
many of it's programs are made by Apogee. Doom is the first iD game
distributed by iD.


--

    {1-5} - When is it coming out?

  Apogee expects it to be ready by Late October 1994, around the time for
release of Doom II and Dark Forces. So it will have ready-made competition.
Isn't that nice? :)

 Note: This will be a simulteanous shareware and retail release.  This will
       be the first game that will come out in shareware and that will be
       on the shelves at the same time.

--

    {1-6} - How much is it?

  The price for it will be $29.95 plus $5 shipping and handling (if they don't
change their shipping policies between now and then). There will be add-ons,
like a Random Comm-bat Zone (tm) generator, a way to get your own player
graphics for use in the modem game, and so on. And, no, Apogee will not accept
pre-orders. They used to in the past, but they have discontinued since then.
The earliest you can order is when it hits the open markets (i.e. at Software
Creations BBS, their home BBS, or at your local software store, whichever
comes first)


--

    {1-7} - How can you order it?

  As I said above, you can order it when it's out, and not before. But, for
those of you who want to be ready to grab it as soon as it comes out, here is
the order info:

Ordering and support:
   * 1-800-GAME-123 to order 24 hours a day.
   * 214-278-5655 for technical support on any game. (8AM-6PM CST M-F)
   * 214-278-4670 to FAX your order(ORDER.FRM) or inquiry.
   * Fill out ORDER.FRM and mail it to Apogee at:

Apogee Software
P.O. Box 496389
Garland, TX  75049

  Or you can buy the retail version at your local software store.

+================+
|Features of RotT|
+================+


    {2-1} - Game story

  You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High-risk United Nations
Taskforce, sent on extremely covert operations to possible trouble spots
outside the three-mile boundary waters of member countries.  You are on a
routine reconnaissance mission on San Nicolas Island, located in the Pacific
twenty miles west of Los Angeles.  Your team is investigating possible cult
activity in an old monastery, when suddenly troops pour out of nowhere!

  In the distance your boat explodes.  Just before your radio goes all static,
you hear desperate newsmen describing the systematic destruction of Los
Angeles. An escaped prisoner informs you that a pyrotechnics expert and a
rich studio head have joined forces with the Oscurido cult.  Their plan:
kill millions of innocent people for the glory of their master, El Oscuro.
Having no other escape route, the HUNT heads into the monastery, taking the
only course of action left: stop the Oscuridos or die trying.

P.S. The person who wrote this story ("You are a member of the HUNT...") is
the same guy who wrote the stories for WOLF 3D and I think DOOM.

    {2-2} - Features

  Now we get to the fun stuff. :) I will add my own commentary, and this is
also from the slide show preview file TRIAD.DOC (I know, I know, if you don't
have it, I'll point you to it soon). Anything with an: o (text here) is from
the TRIAD.DOC which I got this info from. Anything with an: - (text here) is
my commentary.


FEATURES
========
o  Four cool bosses with intelligence, reactions, devious abilities,
   and up to four stages!

-  Of course, you only get one boss in the shareware version.

o  Over thirty levels of death, mayhem, chaos, terror, and so on

-  There are 32 levels, and what will be in the shareware episode is under
debate--it might be new levels, which can be used from the registered version
as alternate game levels.


o  Ten unique, real digitized actors

-  Including strike guards in beige (tan) uniforms, and monks (not REGULAR
monks, bad monks :)

o  Nine wicked weapons, including the massively destructive Firebomb and
   Flamewall.

-  My guess on these weapons is that the Firebomb peppers the area with small
flame bursts, killing massive enemies. The firewall will shoot a missile
out, and when it hits the ground, it will go until it hits a wall, and will
completely destroy anything in it's wake. If it's a person, it will set
them on fire, and do some very funny things to them! Great for taking out
whole rooms of people.

o  Three words: really cool explosions (digitized)

- Like Raptor? Would be neat....

o  A rockin' soundtrack on all the major cards--featuring DigitalDrums
   (where available)
   Supports the following soundcards:
     Gravis UltraSound, All SoundBlasters, Pro Audio Spectrum, WaveBlaster,
     AdLib, SoundMan, Maui, Roland, Disney SoundSource, and many more.

-  So almost every sound card will be supported, including SB AWE 32(included
in "All SoundBlasters"

o  Tons of secret areas, difficult puzzles, and mysterious bonuses

-  Sounds like the normal 3D action genre.

o  Far-out features: Parallaxing sky, look up and down, fog,
   light diminishing, light sourcing, super save games

- Rott is not sector based like Doom is, the light sourcing is handled quite
differently.  Lights illuminate walls, and when you shoot them out, the
light disappears, and the general light of the room dims.

o  Violence level adjustment, from low to excessive, with parental password

-  "parental password"? It looks like the kids will be on this game! (cool!
more opponents!)

o  Choose from five characters--of different genders and races!

- The five characters are:

  1) Thi Barrett -> White female with red hair
  2) Lorelei Ni  -> Oriental female with black hair
  3) Taradino Cassatt -> White male with blonde hair
  4) Doug Wendt -> Black male with dark brown hair
  5) Ian Paul Freeley -> Greco-Spaniard male with very messy hair. :)

o  Brain-numbing Powerups like God Mode and the rare "Dog Mode"

-  God mode is where you get big, and in dog mode, you turn into a dog, you're
invulnerable, and you bite guards.  :)  It's quite hysterical!

o  Fifteen incredible hazards like SpinBlades, FireChutes, FireJets,
   PitTraps, and LavaWalls

- Referenced earlier. In the slide show, it looked like the SpinBlades are
spinning blades that hurt you (hmmm, where did I ever get THAT idea? :)

o  Hilarious jump pads add a new dimension to gameplay.  Fly through the air
   to reach new areas, collect bonuses or run away!

- Like in Cosmo or Jazz? (nah, these gotta be 3D pads, or on the floor as 2D)

o  Auto-tracking for shooting down at enemy from platforms and up at them
   as they fly off jump pads

- In Doom, the targeting is automatic, and your weapon will track in on the
target. With RotT, the whole screen perception will move so that you know
you're targeting someone at a different angle.

o  Two player head-to-head action by modem or serial cable, with nine
   different battle modes, lots of battle options, and RemoteRidicule(tm)
   speech capability.  Don't taunt your enemy with simple text, let him HEAR
   what you think of that last battle!

- This just in from Apogee, they are installing IPX network support for up to
four players, maybe more. (up to how slow you can tolerate.)

- Argh. I was wrong about RemoteRidicule(tm). Joe can't tell me at the moment,
but as the FAQ progresses, and especially when the game is released, then I
(and you) will know much more regarding this area of the game.

o  Twenty buddy-blasting Battle levels (in addition to the 32 normal levels)

- WOW! They're releasing their own Deathmatch levels! There will be a few
battle levels in the shareware, many in the registered, and LOTS in the super-
enhanced version. The numbers as still shaky as to what will be in which. The
person who did most of the Comm-Bat levels has played many an hour of modem
and network Doom, so he's quite versed in the genre. BTW, they won't be called
DeathMatch levels. Comm-Bat is a term that Apogee has trademarked, and we'll
be using it in any of our games that support modem play. Levels are called
Comm-Bat Zones.

o  Editor to be available so you can make your own battle levels

- COOL! We could be seeing a lot of new levels out! The editor might be a bit
later than the RotT release. This is still up in the air.

o  Random level generator so there are always new battle levels to play

- It comes with it's own RanRotT? Neat! This randomizer will be in the
registered version.

o  Over TEN Megs of eye-poppin' graphics!

- That's a lot of graphics....

o  Over FOUR Megs of ear-poppin' sounds!

- There may be a more reasonable 1.5-2 Megs in the normal version, and 4-5 in
the super enhanced version. But there's a LOT of stuff in this game, and if
it moves, it makes noise.

o  The entire game is OVER 20 MEGS unzipped.  The largest shareware game ever!

- This game in it's full incarnation will be quite large. We have no idea what
the size of the shareware episode will be at this time, but a 3 Meg .ZIP file
download is not out of the question. :)


COOL STUFF TO DO
================
o FALL OFF the edge of a level!

- AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! :) You can fall off walkways to the valley
floor. Ouch.

o TOWER OVER little guards in God Mode!

- What guards? *splat* Oh, those ones....

o SNEAK INTO secret rooms in Dog Mode!

- Guard1: Hey, where's that mutt going?
  Guard2: Let him go, he's not going to do anything...
  You: GRRRRRROOOOOWWWWWLLLL!!!! *snap* *snap* *chomp* *chomp*
  Guards 1 & 2: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

  Dog mode is VERY fun.  Not only that, when you're in Dog mode, you're also
  invincible.

o BLOW UP almost EVERYTHING in the environment--including shattering windows!

- Blast a door through! BOOM! OH NO! There's your modem opponent! RUN AWAY!
  RUN AWAY! AAAH! He's got a FLAMEWALL!!! *WHHHHOOOOOSSSSHHHH* ow...Oh
YEAH?!
  Take this! (missile launch) "aiiiiieeeee!!!!" I thought so!
  (sorry, getting carried away there. :)

o  PICK UP a 7-10 split of guards with the sadistic Split Missile!

- Strrrrrrrrrrrrrrrike!

o ROCKET into the air off a jump pad, spin and shoot a heat-seeking missile at
  your buddy, who promptly juices in mid-air!  Fun!

- This could be promising......

o WASTE countless hours of your precious time while you could be doing
  something constructive!

- But Doom was supposed to do that! Oh well.

    {2-3} - Slide show

  Well, I've referenced it throughout the FAQ. The slide show is available
wherever you can find Apogee games (see above). It is called 1ROTPIX.ZIP. When
you run it, you will get a "slide show" of 17 screen shots from the game. The
reason screen shots are out is because Apogee has finished the basic game
engine and has started testing it to iron out bugs. Now, if you do have the
slide show, skip this next part and go down to Picture #1. If you don't have
it, go get it and come back here, I'll wait.

(time passes)

Ready? Okay, you should have this reference handy. Let's go:

Picture #1: This looks like an example of the "fog" condition. You have what
appears to be a rocket launcher, but in RotT, they use missles (all sorts of
them(and about 6 different launchers). The guard is digitized off a real actor
(Steve Quarrela, one of Apogee's Tech Support people). Yes, all the walls ARE
90 degrees to each other, but, you can't judge a game by it's angles (although
it IS nice with non-regular angles). It looks like a maze out there! And,
you notice that we can rack-up scores just like in Wolf 3D!

Picture #2: OUCH! That's gotta hurt! Sorry, Mr Quarrella! :) Remember when I
told you the basic game engine was out? Well, the violence adjustment was one
of the things still being tested out. Oh well. You notice something? You have
two guns! Sounds kinda nice. "Two-Gun Hilman" Seeya on IHHD. :) May I draw
your attention to the spinning blade on the ceiling in the upper left corner
of the picture? (everybody says: "Yes, you may.") Thank you. :) The infinity
symbol at the bottom of the screen means infinite ammo for the pistol, dual
pistol, and machine gun.

Picture #3: Looks like the Wolf3D rifle. See those SpinBlades? I wonder what
that would look like with violence level low? Sorry, Mr Quarrella! :) (he's
one of the low guards in the game, so he appears a lot. See the lights on the
ceiling? They're shootable objects! It seems that when you zoon-up the
screen full-size, the bottom status bar disappears such that you can still
see the info but not block the picture too much!

Picture #4: The spears come up out of holes in the floor, and they are
constantly rotating while they're moving up and down.
Anyway, you see the 3-story buildings in background. You CAN go up there.

Picture #5: Super Save Games! There's more to these save games than just
taking a snapshot. The snapshot save game idea has been used before, but not
like RotT's SSG idea. Joe won't tell me what this means yet, but it also
remembers what level you're on for you (so you don't have to type that in the
description.) If you look carefully, you will notice that there is a strange
background sky for E4A6(BTW, and "A", if you didn't know, means areas, like
M or L in DOOM means Mission or Level(i.e. E2M9, or E1L1). There are MANY
skies in this game.

Picture #6: Monks. If they get too close to you, they start to "suck the life
out of you". Other monks shoot fireballs..... Looks like the health bar at
the bottom left changes color as it gets lower.

Picture #7: Dead Monks. The blockage around you is a gas mask, needed at
times(important times! :)

Picture #8: No, this isn't God mode, this is looks at guys from a ledge.
You're on a platform, looking down and shooting. This is an example of what I
said before of the picture changing perspective when you are shooting down.
In Doom, the guy would just die. RotT shows it happening by tilting the
perspective towards what's happening instead of just letting it happen w/o
you actually seeing it.

Picture #9: There are two different actors here.  There are the two examples
of the low guard here.  The leftmost and the rightmost ones are Steve
Quarrella again, and the middle two are Marianna Vayntrub, the financee of
Mark Dochtermann, the lead programmer of Rott. And 4-story buildings back
there!

Picture #10: You must want that key baaaad. You blow out three windows and
kill a guard to get a little key sitting on a little pedestal.
That's the result of using firebombs. :)

Picture #11: You just shot either a missile. Those things on the ceiling will
crush you if you get stuck under them.

Picture #12: Night.......the FINAL battle. Nope, this is not the final level,
but imagine hunting down your opponent in a nighttime level. :)

Picture #13: FIREBOMB!!!! It looks like it could cause some damage. :) The
person in the shot is George Broussard, the Exec VP of Apogee. He's quite a
bugger to kill. He not only has a machine gun that he shoots, but he also
throws hand grenades at you!! (AAAAAHHH!!!)

Picture #14: Alone in a corridor. Suddenly you hear footsteps. A guard comes
patrolling down the hall. You whip out your pistol and......  The neat thing
about the light sourcing here is that as the actor progresses through the
lights, they get lighter and darker depending on whether they're under a light
or not. The lighting is not sector based like Doom.

Picture #15: Wow. What a view. Looks like a bowl of mush on the floor. It's
one of the food items you can find around the game. It's health.

Picture #16: A knife!!! Looks better than the one in Wolf. The guard in front
of you is Marianna again (she was the two middle ones in #9). The knife is not
a weapon like it was in Wolf3D. There is another actor (not seen in any
slides) that will throw nets at you. If you get hit, you're trapped. You
either need to use the knife to get out, or if you don't have the knife, you
have to wiggle out of the ropes. If there are other actors around, then it can
be really bad news. :)  (The knife will come up autmatically if you get hit
by a new, so you don't have to fumble to find the "1" ket. :)

Picture #17: Rylan "Two-Gun" Hilman vs. Hank "The DOOMER" Leukart over IHHD!!
(not really, but I would hope it would be possible after/if we get registered)
You notice that the picture in the upper-left hand corner is the same as the
face on the remote player. All five modem characters look like individuals.
Right now they all are wearing the same black uniform, so if you're playing
on network, you might have to get close to make sure you're not shooting a
friend!

Picture #1: You ever get that creepy Deja Vu feeling?

Picture #2: Ditto

By now, the person hits Esc to end this, and gets the ending screen:

 (BTW, some of this info has changed)

 Of course.....this FAQ has the info plus more. :) 32 levels 4x wolfenstein
size....The Wolf3D (and Blake) map grids were 64x64. That will probably look
familiar if you've ever tried to edit Wolf3D maps, and did it wronk. One of the
Wolf3D crash errors was "Map not 64*64".
 Anyway, the Rott map grid is 128x128. That means the base map can be 4 times
as large as the largest Wolf3D map was. Some maps in RotT are quite gigantic
and can take forever to get through! :)

    {2-4} - General Questions

  The following is answers to some general questions the public might have.


-

    {2-4-1} - What weapons will you have?

There are lots of weapons: pistol, dual pistol, machine gun, bazooka, heat
seeker, firebomb, flamewall (hilariously powerful), drunk missile, split
missile, and two very powerful magic weapons.

-

    {2-4-2} - Will there be multiple stories?

  Yes. You can go up on platforms that are either 8 feet off the ground or up
to 120 feet off the ground!  You will be able to be physically above another
player, so you can wait on a ledge until the guy you are battling against
runs out of the tunnel you're standing over, aim down, and plaster him (or
her).  It will be the closest you can get to that in a fast action game until
our computers are fast enough to do true 6-D action.
  BTW, if you master the level editor(if you get it) you will be able to
create most buildings with multiple stories(as log as you don't have any non-
90-degree walls). This also means you can create a room with a secret door
into a tunnel under the passageway you were just under. Fun. :)

-

    {2-4-3} - What enemies will there be?

  There are lots of enemies, of three basic types: human, undead monks, and
robots.  The humans have pistols, machine guns, chain guns, grenades, and
many react to what you do.  Some, when shot, will roll out of the way, so you
have to re-aim.
  Bosses aren't just walk-walk-shoot.  You have to figure out how to defeat
them.  The first one is quite tricky.

-

    {2-4-4} - What do the hazards do?

  The hazards are, well, hazardous.  Some are constantly dangerous--you bump
into them, they hurt you, like spinblades, lava walls, and so on.  Some are
periodic, so you have to run through when they are off or out of the way,
like crushing cylinders, firejets, or spinblade stabbers.  Some are moving so
you have to watch out, like moving lavawalls, boulders, and so on.  There's
just a lot of stuff to burn, slice, or crush you.

-

    {2-4-5} - How many levels in the shareware version?

  Eight, and one boss.

-

    {2-4-6} - What are Comm-Bat Zones?

  Comm-Bat Zones are levels optimized for multi-player play. Like the
Deathmatch levels in Doom. Apogee has trademarked the term Comm-Bat, because
they HAD to name their multi player levels SOMETHING.

-

    {2-4-7} - How do God and Dog modes work?

You get the powerup, and:

in God Mode, you tower above the actors, looking down at them.  You hold
out your hand, godfire shoots out straight at them, and they...discorporate.

in Dog mode, you turn into a dog, can't be hurt, bite people, run under low
walls, and your bark is worse than your bite.

Plus there will be two nauseating "powerdowns"....

-

    {2-4-8) - What will tbe different versions be?

  Everything is not solid on these, but right now:

shareware: eight levels, three(?) Comm-bat Zones, some sounds, some songs,
can get it for free.

registered: over thirty levels, ten Comm-bat Zones, lots of sounds (1.5-2
Meg), lots of songs, cost $29.95 + $5 S+H (US dollars)

super-enhanced: over thirty levels, ten Comm-bat Zones, a fifty Comm-bat
Zones pack,  tons of sounds, a random Comm-bat Zone generator, will be $49.95
+ $5 S+H (US Dollars)

I'm not quite sure which the retail is, but it ain't the sharerware, that's
for sure.

To get the super-enhanced, you simply order the super-enhanced version.  It's
like buying the Wolf Pack instead of just three episodes.  I'm sure there
will be some way to upgrade.

    {3-1} - Author's note

  Okay, I am oficially a Veteran FAQ builder. :) I had to edit a LOT for this
version, so I had to shove the version number up .5(instead of a usual .1 for
a small edit). There are some questions left unfulfilled, so I will have to
go back to Joe later and ask more questions(Questions make the FAQs of the
world go round, and round and round and round.....:) Remember, Some of this
is by me, some by the TRIAD.DOC file, a LOT by Joe Siegler :), and some from
other miscellaneous sources.

    {3-2} - Contributions

  Well, since the game isn't even OUT yet, so I can't take contributions like
Hank can.  But, if you happen to notice any spelling, punctuation, or any other
form of mistake or anything, send your notice to rhi...@oasis.rain.com.
(ALL NITPICKERS UNITE!) If you have any important info you think should be in
here, also tell me.

  BTW, this Faq-writing hobby is a non-profit organization.

    {3-2-1} - Contributors

  (BTW, I'm not counting myself and Apogee employees)

  John Maxwell Evans(jme...@valhalla.cs.wright.edu) - My first non-Apogee,
non-me contributor. He sent up some general information, which I widely
scattered(in the appropriate places, at least. :).
