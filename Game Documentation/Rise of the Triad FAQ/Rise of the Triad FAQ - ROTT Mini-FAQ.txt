for Rise of the Triad, the upcoming 3D action game by Apogee Software.  So if 
you read any of this, and something bad happens to you that's related to this 
FAQ, I didn't do it(except if I really DID do it, then I'll tell you 
personally). If anybody is offended, go talk with Apogee.  Remember, as of 
now, Apogee Software is only partly involved in making this FAQ.  So, to 
finish up, if it's a question about the FAQ, ask me. If it's a question about 
R.o.t.T. that is not answered in this FAQ, send e-mail(Internet) to

    {1-1} - A message from the author

  Okay, so I misjugded the release date. Oh well, happens to us all sooner 
or later, and this time, it was later.... :) Anyway, there's a WHOLE LOT OF 
NEW STUFF in this issue. For instance, to legally play it on 11 systems, you
don't need to buy a separate copy for each computer! Read on below about the
special SITE LICENSE. :) 
  BTW, I have finally gotten the RotT FAQ officialized! :)

 - Chapter 2

+================+
|Features of RotT|
+================+


    {2-1} - Pricing, versions, and stuff

We just today (Mon the 5th) finalized what all the versions of Rise of the
Triad will be.  We're still not accepting pre-orders yet, but we will be
some time before the game is released.

Disk-Based Versions
===================

VERSION                 PRICE           CONTAINS
-------                 -----           --------
Shareware               Free            8 Regular Levels
					8 Comm-Bat Zones

Regular Registered      $29.95          32 Regular Levels
					30 Comm-Bat Zones

Power Pack (tm) Add-On  $9.95           10 Extra Comm-Bat Zones (Total of 40)
					Random Level Generator
					Some BMP's & WAV's from the game.

Compact Disc Versions                                                                             
=====================
   
Super Triad             $34.95          Compact Disc Only.
					Includes everything that is in the
					disk-based regular version plus the
					power pack.  (40 Comm-Bat Zones)
					Also has more BMP's and WAV's.
					Has a bunch of our shareware on it.
																									   
Site License            $89.95          Compact Disc Only.
					10 more Comm-Bat Zones (Total of 50)
					Signed Site License Agreement
					Eleven Command Cards

NOTES:

 / The disk based version will only be available in 3.5HD disks.  No other
   format will be sold.

 / Each Episode of Rise of the Triad has 8 levels in it.  There are seven
   regular levels, and one "secret" level per episode.

 / The Super Triad version will be playable off of Compact Disc.  However,
   in order to do that, you'll need tons of memory, or else the game will
   be going to the disc a lot to cache in information, and if you have a
   slow drive, it will be real annoying to play that way.  We will give
   you the choice with the Compact Disc version to either install ROTT
   to the hard drive, or play it from CD-ROM.

 / The shareware levels will be included with all registered versions as
   add-on levels to use when playing.  When you get the registered version
   with the four episodes, you're not getting the same episode again that
   you already played in shareware.  You're getting four _new_ episodes, and
   the shareware episode can be considered a "fifth" episode.

 / If playing on a network, all players must either have their own registered
   copy of Rise of the Triad, or they have to obtain the Site License version.
   (This doesn't apply if you're only using the shareware version.)

    {2-2} - Recent Advancements

RotT is still in beta, but it's getting really close.  They've made some major 
strides recently regarding getting it done and out, and we can finally see 
the light!  :)

This past weekend saw the completion of the modem/serial code part of the game
The network code has been in and stable for quite some time.  They reguarly 
play until 3 and 4 (sometimes later) in the morning on network games.  Some 
of the new Comm-Bat levels in Rise of the Triad are quite insane, especially 
if you play a level really meant for two people with eleven people.  :)

There is still some work to do, mainly sounds, and some fiddly programming to
iron out.  They're desperately going to try and keep the revisions to a 
minimum on this game.  Of course, everyone wants to know the release date.  
We really cannot set that until the game has been completed. They are really 
going to try and have it out before Xmas, but the holidays, plus vacations, 
are going to put a dent in the end of the month, so a January release is 
probably more likely.  We'll probably have a better idea on this around the 
15th or so.

Misc ROTT Notes:

 * Current version of the ROTT FAQ is v2.0(but the Update version is the one
   you're reading.)
 * We are not accepting pre-orders at this time.  We will be shortly.
 * v1.0 will be released with modem and network play.
 * To play this on an IPX network, there will be one computer needed to act
   as the "ROTT Server".  In other words, you'll need one more computer over
   the number of players (if 5 are playing, you'll need 6 computers).
 * We are not accepting any applications to beta test this game.
 * There are two slide shows available.  #1ROTPIX.ZIP & #1ROTPX2.ZIP.

 Joes had several requests for what kind of computer this will require.  The
 game will actually run on a 386DX/33 with 4 Megs of Ram.  However, we
 STRONGLY recommend a 486DX2/66 with 8 Megs of ram AND LOCAL BUS VIDEO.

 Local Bus Video helps out A LOT on these types of games.

   {3-1}  - Author's note
 
  Well, I didn't add on to my v2.0 FAQ, I just sent out an update faq. So what
you should do is to not read this FAQ first(oh, I forgot, you're reading it..)
but to read version 2.0, and then read this to fill in the blanks. If there
is a conflict between the data in v2.0 and this Mini-FAQ, trust the Mini-Faq.
