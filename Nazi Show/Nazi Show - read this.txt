The Nazi Show!

Story:
You play the part of British Commando BJ smith (no relation).
You have been ordered to storm Castle Wolfenstein and murder Adolf Hitler. There 
have been disterbing reports that Adolf is trying to hold a peace confrance with 
world leaders. You have the feeling that  he dosen't just want to sitdown, drink 
tea and eat biscuits. Hell no! So you cock your shotgun and head for Castle Wolfenstein. 
When you get there you look in horror as a huge banner with a swasatger made out 
of petals coloured pink and yellow hung from the Castle.
