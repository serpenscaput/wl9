This adventure takes place about 200 years from now.
In this adventure you are Fred R Blazequick, great great great grandson of William 
J Blazequick (B J to his friends) a famous WW II American agent that gave the enemies 
HELL.
Well those nasty Nazzis are at it again.
You are JUST AS TOUGH B J.

Well THIS time the Nazzis have taken over a space station that is vital to the (U 
P F) - (United Planetary Federation).
The Nazzis thought they killed you on the planet Thorgrad in the Alpha Beta Gamma 
star system.
Well they were WRONG and right now you are STEAMED, and as with B J, this time IT'S 
PERSONAL!!

Now for the good stuff.

Rainbow chest's = 300 points
Rainbow stars = 500 points
Triballs (a tall rainbow triangle with a rainbow ball on top)

Dinners = 10% health
Rainbow balls = 25% health (These are = to first aid for BJ)
Maximum health is 110% and maximum ammo is 200.

If you can find the CHAINGUN you also get the machinegun.
You can also get the MACHINEGUN when you toast an SS officer.
Pick up the AMMO boxes that soldiers drop when you toast them. 
Ammo boxes are dark green box with a light green A.
Ammo boxes can also be found throughout the game. (8 shots when found by themselves, 
four shots when dropped by a soldier you TOAST!)

Before you can start you are captured and taken to a cell and locked in with a guard 
standing outside your cell door.
You tell the guard that you want to give him some info to take to his commander about 
the UPF.
He opens the door HIS mistake.
You quickly kick him in the solarplexis KARATE STYLE!
Then you FINISH the job with his gun but you were heard, NOW you are in for it.
The UPF is counting on you Fred, MAKE THE UPF as proud of you as the USA was as proud 
of BJ!
