Wolffred - by Fred Kenny 

Thank you for downloading this add-on for Wolfenstein 3D. The full version of the 
game is needed to play.

This zip file contains GAMEMAPS.WL6, MAPHEAD.WL6, VSWAP.WL6 and WOLFFRED.TXT. Please 
do not distribute this set with any other files added.

There are 10 new levels on episode three, started by Fred Kenny and completed by 
Brian Lowe. Some later normal levels have bosses, usually Hans Grosse. Episode one 
has ten altered levels by Fred Kenny. The graphics are mainly from Astrostein and 
WolfNuck, though several of the actors come from other sources. Credit is given to 
the authors of the sets mentioned.

Guards - Wolfkkk
White Guards - Eat At Joes
Mutants - Xmaswolf
SS Officers - WolfenDoom

There's lots of treasure (I MEAN LOTS).
The Machine gun is from Wolfnuck.
The chaingun is the WAND from Eat at Joe's.
The two lowest treasures are from Astrostein.
The crowns have been changed to the former 1ups.
1up's are now the ROCKETS from Wolfnuck.

All six episodes have been included because all the levels have been changed in some 
way by Fred Kenny, but only episodes 1 and 3 has been designed especially to play 
with the enclosed VSWAP. On some other episodes the wall designs may look strange 
at times.
 
Thanks go to those at id software for producing such a great game and without which 
this add-on would not be possible.
