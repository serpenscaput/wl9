     In the bar, your objective is to manuver your way through near imposible
  situations, and find your targets and finish them off.  Sound impossible?
  Well you're nearly right!!!  The game is designed for players to master their
  timing, speed, aiming ability, and to provide overall enjoyment...
  Here is some information that will be useful to you in your battles...

     - Speed is essential.  Using the RIGHT SHIFT key while moving, will 
  provide the extra boost needed to escape many dangers.

     - Shoot first, ask later!  Fire rapidly at your enemies, for more often
  than not, he's got 2, 3 or 10 buddies right behind him.

     - Revive with Vivarin!!! For heath boosts, grab the medical kits, which
  are packed with the stuff.

     - Find storage rooms.  Hidden storage rooms are the key to food and ammo.
  Although often difficult to find, they will usually carry the items that
  can completely replentish you.

     - It's Holy Grail Ale time!!! Inside The Bar, you will find money, cash,
  cans of Holy Grail Ale and Bottles filled with Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters.
  Grab the stuff for more points.

     - When in doubt, SAVE YOUR GAME!!!!!  I simply can't stress this enough.
  There are a lot of new and deadly things in this game, and until you master
  them all, you will die a whole lot.  SAVE your game to lessen the frustration.


     - Move quickly and realistically!  If you were really in a bunch of
  corridors with crazy, gun-toting morons after you, you would jump into an
  intersection, while turning, AND firing.  Do NOT walk forward, turn left, aim,

  and then hope to shoot.  This game was designed so that if you play in this
  fashion, YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE!  Go forward WHILE turning.

     - Conserve ammo!  There is not unlimited ammunition in this game.  When in
  doubt, you the handgun, or better yet, the tazer-blade.
