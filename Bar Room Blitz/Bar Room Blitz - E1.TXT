                                   EPILOGUE

      Unless you have completed this game, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!!!!!

     The final bullet strikes The Dallas Cowboy's chest, spraying blood in all
  directions, and sending his lifeless body to the floor with a thud.  Your gun
  finally returns to its holster, and you slump to the ground with fatigue and
  exhilaration.  TDC is dead and you killed him.  Yes you...a lowly Plebe.
  An insane laugh fills you, and you roll on the blood spattered floor for what
  seems like eternity until the other patrons find you.
      For your massive show of bravery, you were promoted to Ensign and given
  command of a bar room training squad...
      The Bar regains its former glory under one of the true owners, Lancelot.
      Cindy Crawford XXI vows to follow you for eternity with her turbo-firing
  flatulator, for destroying her clones...
      Vengeance escapes the bar, and vanishes...
      The hologram projector is kicked very hard for malfunctioning...
      And The Dallas Cowboy is revived with major medical equipment, for the
  sole purpose of executing him...

                                 THE END
