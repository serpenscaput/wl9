        As the newest recruit to the WCHQ, you decide to meet your fellow crew
  members the best way possible...Go into the illustriuous BAR and talk to
  whoever isn't completely sloshed.  
        You step into the bar, expecting to simply grab a drink.  But as your 
  foot crosses the doorway, you instantly become a free target.  You duck
  reflexively as a laser blast sails by, inches from your face.  You leap back,
  behind table 3 to survey the surroundings, and decide what comes next.  As
  you look around, you feel a hand on your shoulder.  You spin around to see
  a gun in your face.
     "Damn Plebes", the man utters under his breath.  "You sure picked... a bad 

  time... to show up."  You look around at the carnage and nod swiftly.  The man

  lowers his weapon and takes a few quick breaths to calm himself down a bit.
     "What the hell is going on in here?" you demand.
     "Guy called The Dallas Cowboy is tryin' to take the whole darn place over
  again,"  the man replies, now able to speak a full sentence.
     "The Dallas Cowboy?" you reply. "Who's that?"
     "Listen kid," the man says. "You don't ask questions in here.  You drink,
  you boast, and you shoot anyone who ticks you off.  So anyways, are you a
  fighter?"
     You put a tough look on your face.  "Damn straight I am!"
     "Then this is the place to test your skills. "He says.  "If you thought
  enemy was bad, wait till ya get a load of us!"  The man leaps to his feet,
  and charges towards another room.  A cow takes flight and clips the man in
  the head, instantly breaking his neck.  His lifeless form slumps to the
  ground.
     You look at your pistol, and the eight rounds it holds and try to build
  your courage.  You leap up from behind the table, raising your gun to meet
  the evil horde of The Dallas Cowboy's followers who turn to face you...
     And so it begins...
