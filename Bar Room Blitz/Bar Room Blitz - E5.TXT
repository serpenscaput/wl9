                                EPILOGUE

        The echoes of Demon's cry of rage and pain still carry through the 
     air as you scan the area for enemy survivors.  Finding none, you 
     holster your weapon and approach the fallen general.  You kneel and 
     grab a handful of his blood matted hair, pulling him face to face 
     with you.
         General Friesel looks like a man who just lost a battle with an 
     ion splicer.  He squints his swollenf and bleeding eyes and peers into 
     your mind.  "You think you've actually won?  I'm nothing.  I'm...
     (cough)... small potatoes!"  With great effort, Demon manages to 
     expel a pool of blood from his tattered lungs, which runs down his 
     face and regroups on the floor.
         You almost pull out your tazer-blade, but figure that in the 
     current situation, more pain is not going to help.  "Tell me who's in 
     charge?" you ask.  "I need to know who's after me."
         Demon gives you a bloody-toothed grin but says nothing.
         "Tell me!  Tell me now!"
         The general's body begins to twitch with spasms of death.  "You 
     can't run little boy... You can't run..."
         "No!" you scream, "you have to tell me who it is!!!!"
         "Can't run... can't run... run..."
