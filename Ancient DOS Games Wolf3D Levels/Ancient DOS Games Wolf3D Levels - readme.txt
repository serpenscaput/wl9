BACKUP YOUR WOLFENSTEIN 3D FILES BEFORE INSTALLING!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply unzip the contents of this map into your Wolfenstein 3D folder and you
will be able to play the custom maps made for the Ancient DOS Games Mod 6
video!

To uninstall, replace the overwritten files with the backups you made. You
did make backups first, right? ...RIGHT?!?

This is only a single map followed by a quick boss arena. Nothing too
spectacular and was made in only a couple hours. :B
