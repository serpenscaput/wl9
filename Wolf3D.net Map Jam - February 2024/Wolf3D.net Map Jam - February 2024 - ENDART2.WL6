When I normally make a map, I go in with a set "story" in my head for it, then build it to try and communicate that story to the player.

Because of the challenge presented by the balance changes, I had to keep reiterating on what I had to make it all work.

If there was a plot it disappeared long ago, as I tried to make things challenging.

I still have a lot to learn, but this should be a bit of fun on IADI, at least.

Thanks for playing!
