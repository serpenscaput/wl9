^C00Thanks for playing my Map Jam entry!

If you hadn't already noticed, this map is non-linear by design - the end requires both keys, but the map doesn't require you to get them in any order. Give it a try with the other path!

Also, feedback is always appreciated. Feel free to let me know what you think of the map on either DHW or Wolf3D.net Discord!

Happy Wolfing!
