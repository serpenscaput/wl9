"Story in a game is like story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not important." - John Carmack

Wise words. Well, what can I say? Nothing really. World politics, TikTok, body image and way too many girls not feeling good about themselves. Terrible. I wish everybody could relax about themselves more. Down with the patriarchy! Dicks suck!

Later, folks.
