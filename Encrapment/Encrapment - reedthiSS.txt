Welcome to Encrapment *Full*. You are about to experience one
of the most revolutionary and retarded mod ideas in the world.
Enjoy!

The full version took many months of sleepless nights....
(actually it was finished almost the same time when Encrapment
Beta was released, but as Hitler once said, "What good fortune
for governments that the people do not think", erhm.... yeah.)

Right. Now the New are:

- No additional files required
- All walls/enemies/misc art that were missing in shareware wolf
  encraped!!, hehehe.
- Encraped sounds!   [yup, all of them]
- Syntax, grammar, spelling mistakes and typos in Rea Me and each
  episode's endgame breafings  [seems that now you have to beat
  all of them over to see it, eh?]
- Maybe something more, I don't remember
- Oh yeah, and a crappy speedmade flash trailer instead of the
  promised one   [on Encrapment's website intro]

As for a bonus pack you get some encraped sounds in wave format


,.Bugs:

My favourite one is cimex lectularius.
Also looks like zombies do not speak. Don't knowcare why.
