Welcome to Encrapment *Beta*. You are about to experience one
of the most revolutionary and retarded mod ideas in the world.
Enjoy!


  ABOUT:

Encrapment is a mod/conversion of the game Wolfenstein 3D.
Its goal is (guess) to encrap it.

*Beta* is not the final version and is dedicated to beta
testers. It replaces all Wolfenstein 3D wall textures,
sprites and misc. game graphics (such as menu, ReadThis, etc.)

The final version will feature:
 - Compatibility with the full version of Wolfenstein 3D
 - Encraped menu/ReadThis fonts
 - Encraped sounds


  INSTALLATION:

This mod requires the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D.
You get it from: ftp://ftp.3drealms.com/share/1wolf14.zip
a) Unzip all *.WL1 files from this archive into your
Wolfenstein 3D folder b) Launch the game.


  PROCESS OF ENCRAPMENT:

Encrapment uses JPEG engine to optimise the quality of an
extracted art element. The original 256 color palette then
is applied. Finally, the element is to be imported
back to Wolf3D. Sprites require quite a bit more work,
because of the transparent background, which is destroyed
by the JPEG optimisation mechanism. The work includes lots
of cropping and pixel drawing, and that is the reason why
this beta is so delayed.
