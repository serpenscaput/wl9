FlooEdit 
and you obviously 
NOW STOP THAT HESITATING AND PLAY MY DEMO! =) 
btw the full version is expected to have 60-70 levels. have fun!!!
NOte: DO NOT play the saved games...instead, save over them. the saved games are 
saved when the DEMO was under developement. so when you play the saved games by me,remember 
you are noty playing the lastest version of wolf3d, and the saved games will contain 
spoilers!!
