                           The Crumbling Riech

        This it the end of the line for our big hero. The Nazi forces
    
    are fading fast. You must play the role of Mr. Clean. Your job is

    simple: hit the last Nazi stronghold and kill any brown or blue 
    
    shirt that tries to get in your way. You will go in through an 
    
    outpost located 500 yards from the base. There you will enter their

    underground caverns and locate the elevator to their main base. 
    
    Once inside, shoot anyone and everyone who doesn't like to hear 
    
    memoriable war stories about the good ol' U. S. of A. This is your

    last mission. Pass this, and its an all-expence paid vacation to

    the Hawaiian Islands. But fail...well...lets just say that those SS 

    soldiers go a little overboard in the torture dept.
