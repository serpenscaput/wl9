Storyline:
The  year is 1943. As William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the Allies' most audacious and fearless espionage operative, your latest mission is nothing short of monumental. A few months ago, Allied Intelligence had pinpointed the lair of Otto Giftmacher, the mastermind behind the Nazis' terrifying new chemical warfare division. His menacing inventions posed a catastrophic threat to the world at large, and it proved crucial that you infiltrated his stronghold and neutralized him before these nefarious weapons wreak havoc upon civilisation.

As you stand over Giftmacher's bleeding remains, however, the plot thickens. Giftmacher isn't the lone architect of this chemical nightmare; two other high-ranking Nazis are deeply entwined in this sinister plan: Gretel Grosse and General Fettgesicht. With Otto Giftmacher out of the picture, the focus shifts to his accomplices. Your next target: Gretel Grosse, the overseer of the factory churning out the bomb casings for Giftmacher's chemical arsenal. Your mission leads you to an office complex adjacent to this ominous plant, the heart of Gretel's operations. Eliminating her will strike a critical blow to the weapon production, bringing the Allies tantalizingly close to dismantling the Nazis' chemical weapon scheme. The final hurdle before General Fettgesicht, the linchpin of this diabolical plot.

Prepare for the most harrowing and dangerous mission of your career, Blazkowicz. Over a thousand Nazi troops, fervently committed to their cause, stand between you and your objectives. Braving the heavily guarded bunker is just the beginning; the formidable Gretel Grosse awaits. Steel yourself, load your pistol, and brace for an epic showdown. Armed only with a knife and a Walther P38 (so you can use any German ammo you might find), you must make your way in. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere inside. 
This is the moment you've been training for - a battle that will test your limits and shape history!
