WVisio2. (information file).

I changed these maps around from WolfSF2, because I felt that WlfVisio should be 
given more prominence, and also because WlfVisio and the Spear demo looks better 
with the original Wolf3D graphics.

Anyways, thanks to A. Anonymous for converting these files so that they work on the 
shareware 1.4 version.

Wvisio2 is a real tough set (Hans Grosse makes many appearances). This is how I changed 
the 
levels around.

Levels 1 thru 3 (Wvisio 1/3)
Levels 4/5 (as previous)
Levels 6/7 (Spear demo)
Level 8 (Street Fighter)
Boss Level (Wvsio 10)
Secret Level (Wvisio 9)

This sequence puts the WVisio secret level back where it was originally.

This set should be played with the original shareware 1.4 Wolfenstein 3-D set.
