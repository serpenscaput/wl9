After Dean's post on his blog about a little known mod called 6:25, (which you can 
read here: http://deans-wolf-blog.blogspot.com/2011/09/great-mods-youve-probably-never-heard.html)

I decided to see if it really is that hard to come up with something interesting 
in such a small grid. Well, it is. I couldn't fill an entire
episode, so it's just these 6 + 1 secret level. Perhaps I will do another episode 
some day. Perhaps not.

The levels can be found in episode 1. The other episodes are empty so don't even 
bother selecting them. ;)

Features:
There is one 'twist': knifes are silent and one stab in the back kill instantly. 
I wanted to give this little mod a more stealthy feel.
