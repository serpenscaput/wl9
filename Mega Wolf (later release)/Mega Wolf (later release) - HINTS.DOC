Sorry, everybody, but in this version of MegaWolf, we want people to find out
for themselves! Besides, we don't want to take the fun out of the game, now do
we? Nah!

If you're extremely desperate in finding some help on this game, look for the
older version of the game (the one with the crappy FILE_ID.DIZ). The HINTS.DOC
actually has hints in it. WOW!!
