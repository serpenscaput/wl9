^C25 Intermission from O.S.S.:

^C25 Now when you finally have arrived there, try to find as much information as 
possible about the nazi plans.
^C25 Getting out might be a bit harder than the getting in was, so you should prepare 
yourself to face strong resistance...

^C25 As this is your final task there, we hope you do your best... May the God be 
with you B.J... Good luck.
