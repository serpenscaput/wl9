Episode 1 Level 1 is a scratch built floor. The mini-gun in front of you is
there for a reason. Just use your bullets wisely. The secret floor for 
Episode 1 was created by my brother Tony Bruni. It's tough. The trick is to 
push the walls in the correct sequence. Watch out for the Pac Men, though.
The Boss floor for Episode 1, I added many winding, interconnected passages.
It's easy to get lost. So, try to remember where you are. The rest of the 
floors to Episode 1, are modified versions of the original maps. I've changed 
the colors, moved the keys, moved the entrance to the level and tried to make
them look as different as possible. Episodes 2 and 3 follow this same scheme.
Some levels are easier than others. Some levels have both keys behind secret 
walls, so you'll have to check all the walls to find them. I'm planning to 
rework all the floors, eventually. So,. if you like these let me know. My 
CompuServe address is David Bruni 74353,357. Let me know what you think good
or bad. I welcome all comments. Keep on Wolfing.
