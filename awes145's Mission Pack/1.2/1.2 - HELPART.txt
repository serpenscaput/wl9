^c00This is the epic story of B.J. Blazkowicz, American spy for the Allied forces in World War II.  Facing horrific dangers, sometimes he only had a knife and his wits between him and death.  His escape from Nazi imprisonment is the stuff of contemporary legend.

^c00Herein are the tales of our hero and his nighttime assault on the wagers of chemical war: his assignment to eliminate Otto Giftmacher, the creator of the weapons; his search for the plans to the Giftkrieg, or Poison War; and his final battle against the man organzing the insidious war, General Fettgesicht.  This is the tale of how B.J. Blazkowicz became a symbol of freedom and justice, how he stood against untold odds and dealt the enemy a crippling blow.

Captain William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, you've got a gun and a deadly mission ahead. Good luck!





Hey, if you make it, you'll have something to tell your grandkids about . . . .

If you don't, at least you'll go out in a blaze of glory!

^c7eCONTROLS
^c00
In Wolfenstein 3-D, you can use the keyboard, mouse, joystick, or Gravis PC Gamepad.
 
To move around the menus, use the arrow keys to move from item to item, then press ^c6eEnter ^c00to select that item.  ^c6eEsc ^c00always backs out.  You can press the first letter of a menu item to go to that item.

Or use the mouse, joystick, or Gamepad-- they work, too!
^PAGE 7
^G20,16,5
Once you are in the game, use the arrow keys to move. Hold down ^c6eShift ^c00to run fast.

Press ^c6eCtrl ^c00to fire your weapon.

Use ^c6eAlt ^c00 with the left and right arrows to slide side to side instead of turning left or right.  This is called "Strafe Mode."

Press ^c6eSpace ^c00to Open Doors and activate elevators to go to the next floor of the keep.
^PAGE 8
^G16,16,6
When using the mouse or joystick, use button 1 to shoot, button 2 to strafe.



With a three-button mouse, use the third button to open doors.

Gravis PC Gamepads have a fourth button, useful as a run button.

Once you have more than one weapon, the keys 1-4 choose the weapons:








Holding down the fire button is fun, but short bursts save bullets.

Some walls in the prison can be pushed back to reveal hidden rooms. Hold down Space to push the wall in front of you. Just think of Space as the Use key. It will use doors, use elevators, and so on.

There are locked doors in the castle that require either a gold or silver key.  It will be somewhere on the floor you're on.

If you find your health dropping, pick up some food or first aid.  You'll find you're damaged more when shot at close range.

Pick up the ammo left behind when you toast someone.  For instance, perforate an SS--free machine gun!


You get a free guy every 40,000 points, so collect those treasures! (You can have a maximum of nine lives.)

When you get killed, you lose everything but your gun and start at the beginning of the floor you were on.

^c7eABOUT ^c6eId ^c7eSOFTWARE
^c00
Yes, that's Id, as in the id, ego, and superego in the psyche.  We think shareware is a fine alternative to the high prices of commercial vendors.  For under twelve dollars a game, you can get the hottest, fastest texture-mapped game available.  How can you beat that?

^c2cWe'll answer that question in a few months. . . .
