What a thrill...
With darkness and silence through the night...
What a thrill...
I'm searching and I'll melt into you...

What a fear in my heart...
But you're so supreme...

I give my life,
not for honor, but for you... (snake eaterrrrr)

In my time...
There'll be no-one else...

Crime, it's the way I fly to you... (snake eaterrrrr)

I'm stillllllll in a dream, Snake Eater (MGS3 Edition [Trademark Symbol])

Someday, you go, through the rain,
And someday, you feed, on a tree frog...

This ordeal, the trial, to survive...
For the day we see new light!

I give my life,
not for honor, but for you... (snake eaterrrrr)

In my time...
There'll be no one else...

Crime, it's the way I fly to you...

I'm stillllllll in a dream, Snake Eater...


IIIIIII'm stillllllll in a dream, Snake Eater!!!
