You step over to find General Fettgesicht laying down on the ground, his body wisping from smoke covered with bullets you lunged in his body. You hear a voice saying something about having no regrets... so maybe... the Nazi general was possessed by a demon?

There's some grey-skinned people now, hopeful they aren't too bad...

You recieve a Medal of Honor for your actions in Nazi Germany and Arizona. You sleep well... 
...until you recieve a letter of action the next day!

THE END...?
