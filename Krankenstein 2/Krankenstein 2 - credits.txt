This mod was made with Floedit 2, Paint Shop Pro 7 and my own 'Seefiles' program.

The game uses the original Wolfenstein 3D v1.3 engine.

  I did most of the graphics and a few sounds myself but included some,
for he most part modified, from Duke Nukem 3D and the Wolfenstein mods
Hotel Romanstein,
Christmas Wolf,
Lost Episodes,
Schabbsdoom (for dr. Krankenstein).

  The paintings are by Munck, Chagall and Rembrandt,
the photos are of Marilyn Monroe and queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
I was inspired by the thriller 'Coma' and the first danish private hospital, 'Mermaid 
Clinic'.
If you like, you may copy the WSWAP.WL1 file to a 'Krankenstein (I)' directory and 
use
the improved graphics for that game.

  About the game...
The levels are a bit more difficult than in Krankenstein I,
you must use various stealth strategies. and solve a few mazes.
No keys are behind secret doors, some (but not all) locked doors are there for logical 
reasons
and need not (or can't) be opened. You don't have to kill all enemies or open every 
secret door.

  The story...
Dr. Krankenstein is back, thanks to quite a few organ transplants.
Unfortunately his brain ¨was intact as well as his dear wife,
(he may have his reasons for making all those clones.)
He has started up a new hospital somewhere else, and YOU, equipped with a temporary 
License to Kill,
is sent out to sneak around and record the goings-on. Unhappily you were captured 
instantly
by the security staff and dumped in a slightly disturbing room for further questioning.

You must fulfill your task and (hopefully) get out alive.

  For more fun:
      make use of your dirty phantasy.
