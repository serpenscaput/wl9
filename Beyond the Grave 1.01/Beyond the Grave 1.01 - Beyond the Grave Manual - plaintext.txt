STORY
In a time and place where chaos, violence, and crime were rampant, two
brothers, Sartana and Pike, were renowned and feared. Born as twins in
1840, they had become the most sought after hired guns in the west by the
time they were 20. Eventually, their reputation had earned the attention of
civil war officers and between 1861 and 1865, they fought for the Union.
Together, they racked up quite the body count and both earned medals of
honor for valor and devotion by the end of the war.
After the war, the two brothers made their living as bounty hunters. As the
two further developed their reputation, Sartana noticed Pike slowly
turning into someone he did not recognize. Pike became cruel and ruthless.
He didn't just simply kill the men who had bounties on their heads; he
would capture them, bind them, and torture them over long periods of
time. Eventually, Pike changed his name to Devil Eyes; it was fitting given
the fact that Pike enjoyed gazing deeply into the eyes of his victims as the
life slowly left their bodies.
Some years later, news about people being kidnapped in the dead of the
night for unknown reasons spread like wildfire. The kidnappings were
committed by a mysterious cult, led by a trio called the Unholy Trinity.
Bounties were put in place for various cult members. The rewards were
high, so high that Pike became greedy. He no longer wanted to split the
rewards, which caused a rift between the two brothers. One night, while
Sartana was sleeping, Pike went out on his own in search of the cult.
Sartana awoke in shock, knowing that his brother had abandoned him. He
was alone.
After a couple more years of lone bounty hunting, Sartana yearned for the
quiet life and made way for North Carolina where much of his family lived
at the time. During his trek, an enigmatic hooded lady, seeming to appear
from thin air, approached him, claiming to have news of his brother's
whereabouts. Sartana was convinced that the woman was lying until shePage | 4
tossed him Pike's prized Colt 45. He knew it was Pike's peacemaker
because his initials were chiseled on the side of the gun.
Sartana asked the lady about Pike's location. She unraveled an ancientlooking map 
and pointed to an island, uncharted on any conventional map
at the time, near the Bermuda Triangle. She called the place Isla de la
Sombra (Island of the Shadow). She then gave Sartana directions on where
to acquire a boat to get to the island. Sartana then asked the strange lady
how she knew where to find him and how she knew about Pike. An impish
grin crawled on her pallid face as she said, "my master knows everything…
and you and your brother both bear the mark."
Sartana, confused, inquired about the mark. The woman pointed to the
birth mark on the back of Sartana's neck and said, "You two were destined
to be his left and right hand." She then walked away. Sartana called for her,
but his calls fell on deaf ears as the hooded lady disappeared into the pitch
black night.
Against his better judgment, Sartana decided to go find his brother. He
headed south, amassing food and resources along the way, to the border of
Georgia where he acquired the boat to get to Shadow Island.
After a few days of sailing, the boat crashed into a sandy shore in the
middle of the night, waking Sartana from his slumber. He wasn’t sure if he
had arrived at his destination or some random island. Regardless, he was
weary from sailing and sought rest.
Sartana moored his boat and stepped foot on the sandy shore, proceeding
toward a vast forest in search of a suitable place to camp. As Sartana set up
camp, robed hooligans emerged out of nowhere. He was surrounded.
Sartana instantly reached for his Colt, but before he could get a single shot
off, he was knocked out by a massive blow to the back of the head. Sartana
awoke the next night in a decrepit vacant room lit by candlelight, stripped
of his weapons, bound to an altar, and encircled by dark hooded figuresPage | 5
decked out in long voluminous robes as black as night. A tall handsome
man in a dusty grey coat and an open crown hat upon his head appeared
in the distance, slowly making his way toward Sartana. It was Pike, except
he was not the same.
His skin had an uncanny pallor and his eyes glinted like emeralds frozen in
ice. Pike gazed upon his brother. A dire grin slowly formed on his face,
revealing tiger-like teeth. Sartana, in a weak voice, asked, "what happened
to you Pike?"
Pike responded, "call me Devil Eyes." After that, Devil Eyes unsheathed a
silver ritualistic blade and stabbed it deep into his brother's heart. Darkness
cloaked Sartana's eyes as death enveloped him in its abysmal grasp. There
was no telling what lied ahead…Page | 6
INSTALLATION
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Beyond the Grave is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 (the
game works best with Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems).
To play the game, you just need to double click on the GRAVE.exe file after
unzipping the files. This mod is standalone, so no additional files or
software is needed to play it. This game can be distributed free of charge.
Please share with your friends!
TROUBLESHOOTING
I tried to make this game as glitch-free as possible, but nothing is perfect.
Here are some known issues with the game:
QUICKSAVING/QUICKLOADING: Using quicksave and quickload
(F8/F9) causes a lot of problems (eg: inventory items are not saved
correctly). Use F2 and F3 to save/load.
DISPLAY ISSUES: Minimizing the game causes the numbers on the HUD
to disappear. Try to avoid minimizing the game and don't play the game in
windowed mode.
SCREEN RESOLUTION: Using resolutions larger than the game's native
resolution (640x480) is known to cause the game to crash. It's best to play
the game in its native resolution.
SOUND ISSUES: Occasionally, the game is known to crash when a sound
plays right at the same time a MIDI track loops. Reload the game if this
happens. Most levels in the game use the OGG format for music, so this
should not be much of an issue.
COMPATIBILITY: Some older computers (running on XP or below) and
some newer computers (running on windows 8.1 or windows 10) havePage | 7
issues with running the game (IE: the game crashing upon startup). Here
are some things you can do to fix these issues:
-For Windows 10 users: try running the game using Windows 7 or 8.1
compatibility mode.
-For Windows 8.1 users: try running the game in Windows 7 compatibility
mode. Windows 8/8.1 does not seem to have as much of an issue running
the game as some newer computers using Windows 10.
-For Windows XP users: try running the game under Windows 98/ME in
256 color mode and the resolution setting marked.
OTHER ISSUES: Occasionally, the attack frames get messed up when
restarting a level after dying. Reloading a saved game or reloading the
game seems to fix the issue.
If you find any other issues, please let me know (see Contacting the Author
section).Page | 8
GAME DIFFICULTIES
When you start the game, you are prompted to choose between four
difficulties; the harder the difficulty, the stronger and more numerous the
enemies. You will also notice that the amount of starting wards and
maximum wards you can have differs on each difficulty level (wards are
discussed in greater detail in the Items sections under Power-Ups).
Where’s my grave? - This difficulty is only recommended for sissies
and people with no FPS/PC gaming experience. Note: there is no enemy
spawning on this difficulty, which eliminates a lot of the surprise/horror
elements in the game. Starting Wards -- 2; Maximum Wards –- 5
Maybe just a sip - This is a slightly better place for the inexperienced to
start than the previous (mainly because we won't make fun of you AS
MUCH for playing on this difficulty). Enemy spawning is left intact and
certain enemies are stronger. Starting Wards -- 2; Maximum Wards -- 5
Ravenous - This is the recommended difficulty setting to play the
game on. It provides a decent challenge even for experienced players.
Starting Wards -- 1; Maximum Wards -- 4
Even death will bleed - If you are a veteran player, someone who likes a
good challenge, a masochist, or someone with suicidal tendencies, then this
is a difficulty fit for you. Bosses are harder, the hordes of the undead are
larger, and cultists are faster moving on this difficulty. Starting Wards -- 0;
Maximum Wards -- 3Page | 9

GAME BASICS
PICKING THINGS UP
Even in the midst of all the darkness and turmoil, there's always time to
grab a few trinkets or helpful items. To pick up an item, simply walk over
it. Some items (power-ups and new weapons) will require you to press the
'use' key to pick up.
DOORS
Some doors (such as locked doors) are imbued with magical properties that
make them shut automatically shortly after being opened for inexplicable
reasons. Other doors stay opened; for these doors, it is a good idea to shut
them as some enemies (like zombies) are too stupid to open them. Press the
'use' key to open and shut doors.
SWITCHES
Throughout your adventure, you will notice walls with rune-powered
switches. These switches open up areas of the map that would not be
accessible otherwise. Some switches open up secret areas of the map where
as some switches are necessary to activate in order to move on to a new
area of the map or exit a level.
INFERNAL POWER
Returning from the dead not only made Sartana stronger than ever but also
infused within him infernal powers from the other side. These powers have
granted him with the ability to emit a fiery stream of death from the
windows of his soul. Press 'C' to use Sartana's infernal power.Page | 13
WEAPONS
The denizens of Shadow Island all have one common goal: to kill you. In
order to prevent them from succeeding, you will need to gather up an
arsenal of death-dealing instruments. Most weapons have a primary attack
and a secondary attack.
PUNCHING & KICKING
You begin your quest armed with only your fists and a damaged machete.
Once you acquire a more competent weapon, you won't be using your fists
much... unless you have a death wish. You can also kick your enemies (it is
a much slower attack but it deals more damage than your fists). As an
added bonus, you can also kick while using other weapons. Press 'F' to
kick.
MACHETE
Accuracy: -
Power: Average
Speed: Average
Ammo: None, but can be broken
A large knife with a broad blade that can be very effective if you are able to
get it between you and your foes. The most wonderful thing about the
machete is its ability to maim and dismember. Enemies that fall to your
blade almost always die with a part (or parts) of their anatomy missing.
Note: the machete deals less damage when damaged. It can also be broken,
so use it wisely. The machete also has the capability of surprise attacking
enemies. If there's an enemy with his back turned, try sneaking up on him.
Sneak attacks kill most enemies in one hit, but not all enemies are
susceptible to it.Page | 14
PEACEMAKER
Accuracy: Very Good
Power: Good
Speed: Average
Ammo: 45 caliber
An accurate single action revolver that packs a decent punch. It can shoot
faster, though less accurately, by fanning the hammer. The peacemaker is
probably one of the most versatile weapons in the game and is a favorite
among many gunslingers. The main drawback is its tedious reloading
process as bullets have to be loaded individually.
FRONTIER
Accuracy: Good
Power: Average
Speed: Very Good
Ammo: 38 caliber
A double action revolver made by two close friends of yours: Smith and
Wesson. This quick-shooter might not be as powerful or as accurate as the
peacemaker, but it makes up for it with its speed. Additionally, the
weapon's top break mechanism allows for the utilization of a speed loader
which makes reloading quicker.
RAINMAKERS
Accuracy: Average
Power: Poor
Speed: Excellent
Ammo: 22 caliber
Incredibly fast-shooting swing-out-cylinder revolvers that have been
modified to carry double the ammo capacity of a regular revolver. The
Rainmakers are very handy in tight situations, and when used with a Rage
Sphere activated you can easily clear a room with these twin brothers.Page | 15
BOOMSTICK
Accuracy: Ugly
Power: Very Ugly
Speed: Poor
Ammo: Shells
The Boomstick is a very reliable ally indeed. It may lack a lot of accuracy,
but you aren't using a double-barrel shotgun for accuracy now are you!?
This weapon can be fired either one barrel at a time or both at once for
maximum damage.
THE SAVAGE
Accuracy: Poor
Power: Excellent
Speed: Poor
Ammo: Slugs
The Boomstick's bigger, badder brother. This semi-auto beast will hurl
your foes into an early grave with relative ease. Though it deals quite a
punch and can carry more ammo than its double-barreled brother,
reloading this weapon is slow and cumbersome.
THE RECTIFIER
Accuracy: Very Good
Power: Good
Speed: Very Good
Ammo: 44-40 WCF
This fast, high capacity repeater carbine is probably the most well-balanced
firearm in your arsenal. It is an ideal weapon for killing groups of lesser
enemies.Page | 16
THE REAPER
Accuracy: Excellent
Power: Very Good
Speed: Good
Ammo: Silver Bullets
A powerful repeater carbine that shoots high caliber silver bullets. It is
more powerful and slightly more accurate than The Rectifier. Great for
wiping out more powerful foes, especially those pesky werewolves.
THE DEVIL'S MULE
Accuracy: Excellent
Power: Enemy will not be recognizable
Speed: Very Poor
Ammo: Incendiary
This mule doesn't like it when people are laughing. He gets the funny
feeling they are laughing at him. Well... they won't be laughing very long
when the trigger is pulled. One shot from this monster turns even the
hardiest beasts inside out.Page | 17
ITEMS
There are various items that will aid you on your quest. Some items can be
used as needed while others will be activated the moment you pick them
up and will wear off after an elapsed amount of time.

these.Page | 18

weapons.

keep a certain amount of them to use whenever you want. You can select
inventory items by using the mousewheel or the '9' and '0' keys. Note:
healing serums and indurating amulets are not selectable inventory items.
They have their own designated hotkeys to allow the player to quickly heal
or boost armor as needed

the power to steal life; once acquired, the effect is permanent.
However, keep in mind that you will lose the knife and its
power if you die.
KEYS
Enemies aren't the only things hindering your progress.
Apparatuses called locked doors can be a major source of
frustration. To conquer these foes, you need keys. There are
four different keys: Gold, Red, Blue, and Green.Page | 23
ENEMIES
The Island of the Shadow features a wide assortment of adversaries with
unique abilities. This section will tell you all you need to know about them.
CULTISTS
The Unholy Trinity's cult army is ruled by a strict chain of command
divided into three groups: Followers, the Low Order, and the High Order.
THE FOLLOWERS
General followers make up the bulk of the cult and consist mostly of young
boys and girls raised within the Shadow Cult community from the time of
birth.
MARTYRS
Martyrs are prepubescent children who have either been
possessed or subjugated to rigorous brainwashing. They are
often on the frontlines mindlessly sacrificing themselves for
their unholy masters. Though they are easy to take down, they are quick
moving and can easily overwhelm you in numbers.
ACOLYTE
Gifted martyrs that manage to survive well into their teen
years become acolytes. They are more disciplined and have
better control over the firearms given to them.
FANATIC
Only the hardiest of followers become fanatics. These
shotgun toting baddies are fast and deadly, and each of them
hopes to earn a position in the Low Order by blowing your
head clean off.Page | 24
THE LOW ORDER
The Low Order consists of cult members with a great deal of talent and/or
experience. They are often seen fighting alongside the followers they
command. Members of the Low Order are given better firearms which
makes them more difficult adversaries.
DEACON
Two fast-firing friends accompany these entry level Low
Order members and they won't hesitate to mow you down
with them.
ARCHDEACON
These silent assassins are not to be trifled with. They are
armed with three different firearms and they know how to
use them well. The fact that you won't hear them coming
makes them even more dangerous. Be very careful not to get too close to
them or else they will gladly introduce you to their buckshot-filled little
brother.
PRIEST
Once members of the Low Order make it to priesthood, they
are adorned with more elaborate garments and given a shiny
new companion named Winchester. Priests are lightly
armored and often keep to the back, preferring to pick their targets off from
behind friendly lines. This makes them tougher to take down.
HIGH PRIEST
High priests are some of the most formidable foes you will
encounter. These fleet-footed bastards can either blast you
into oblivion with their high capacity revolvers or use their
scepters to summon forth a hammer from hell to hurl at you.Page | 25
THE HIGH ORDER
Only a select number of cult members are allowed to join the ranks of the
High Order. High Order leaders are often so old that they have an almost
corpse-like appearance and are often frail of limb. Nonetheless, they are
still very powerful. They have abandoned the use of firearms and prefer to
use dark sorcery as their main weapon. Rumor has it that the source of
their power comes from the blood of the living.
BISHOP
These keepers of the dark faith want nothing more than to
have your corpse for the main course at their next dinner gettogether. Avoid their 
barrage of fiery projectiles. Getting hit
by them will surely make their future dinner plans a reality.
ARCHBISHOP
If you thought the bishops were bad, these vile entities put
them to shame. They move quicker and can take more
damage than their bishop brethren. Also, their red lightning
projectiles are fast and sometimes hard to avoid. They also aren't afraid to
rip your face off if you get too close to them.
CARDINAL
Anyone who has lived long enough to become a Cardinal of
the High Order is both revered and greatly feared. Cardinals
possess the ability to summon swarms of bats to protect them
and they can also launch a ghastly ball of fire at you. The robe that they
wear also makes them resistant to most weapons in your arsenal.Page | 26
THE ELITE GUARD
The Elite Guard was created for the singular purpose of protecting the
Unholy Trinity at all costs. They are a group of highly specialized soldiers
(think of them as like Special Ops). No one knows how they are chosen or
where they come from. All you need to know is that they are dangerous.
ROGUE
Armed with a Devil Mule's rifle, rogues hide, sit back, and
wait patiently for an opportunity to snipe you from a
distance. Tread carefully in forested areas or places where
there are a lot of nooks and crannies to hide in.
ENFORCER
These heavily armored brutes can take more punishment
than the average cultist. Not to mention, their silver-bullet
hurling companion packs quite the punch. It is no wonder
that one of the enforcer's main roles is keep the Shadow Cult's werewolf
pets in check.
BARON
These peacemaker packin' gunslingers will put one bullet in
each of your eyes quicker than you can say your name. They
are speedy and fast to the draw, so you'll want to dispatch of
them quickly.
DARK HUNTER
Not much is known about these mysterious soldiers except
that they harbor a dark bestial secret, which few have lived
to see and report about.Page | 27
ANTI-PALADINS
Though they are slower than other elite guards, these dualshotgun wielding lords 
of the dark are much tougher to take
down. You will have to deal out a lot of abuse to kill them
and you will definitely want to stay out of their line of fire.
THE UNDEAD
The undead hordes make up much of the Shadow Cult's frontline of
defense. Most of them do not pose too much of a threat, but they can be
quite a nuisance in large numbers.
ZOMBIE
Slow, clumsy, and stupid. These stiffs mostly just get in the
way. Just try not to get swarmed for they often attack in big
groups.
UNDEAD HOUND
These hounds go down easily, but their speed gives them a
slight edge over their bipedal piers. Their speed and fast bite
also make them more formidable foes in groups than
zombies.
SKELLY
Something carved this poor SOB's face out and turned it into
a toothed vagina that's going through one hell of a menstrual
cycle. These things launch acidic balls of blood at you from a
distance and have no qualms with administering an almighty haymaker
square in your face if you get too close to them.Page | 28
UNDEAD GUNMAN
Slow, easy to take down, but slightly smarter than other
zombies as they can open doors and operate a firearm (albeit
very crudely--these guys couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
if they were standing three feet in front of it).
UNDEAD BOUNTY HUNTER
Like the undead gunman, except more dangerous as their
preferred firearm, a semi-auto shotgun, doesn't require much
accuracy to hit you.
UNDEAD HEADSMAN
Fast, deadly, and hard to take down. Be careful not to get
blocked in by them when they attack in groups.
ASWANG
These floating legless entities are made from the dead bodies
of fallen bishops. They are on a constant quest to drain the
life force from anything with a pulse. Luckily, they have to
get close to in order to drain life and they go down relatively easy. One
well-placed shotgun blast makes short order of these flying torsos.
RED DEATH
The unholy trinity created these undead goliaths from the
bone, sinew, and tissue of innocent people (many of these
innocent people include children). These walking tanks
might be slo-moving, but they take quite a beating before going down. Not
to mention, their long bony talons pack quite the wallop (DON'T get close
to them). Even from a distance, you are not safe from these red behemoths
as they have been given the ability to summon spectral balls of energy,
which they launch at their foes from afar.Page | 29
SPECTRE
Little is known about these phantom figures other than they
are said to be found roaming about cemeteries late at night.
Some say they cannot be killed.
OTHER ENEMIES
BAT
While they don't pose very much of a threat, these little
winged pests have an irritating habit of getting in the way.
Kill them all as soon as possible.
WEREWOLF
These hulking brainwashed monstrosities are prized pets of
the Shadow Cult. They are the fastest enemies you will
encounter and fighting them toe-to-toe is downright suicidal.
They'll tear you to pieces with tooth and claw in a matter of seconds. The
fact that they usually attack in packs doesn't help matters.
INFERNAL TURRENT
These stationary hell cubes were designed by Zagan to
pummel any hostile target with a flurry of fire. Destroy them
quickly before they destroy you.
WRAITH
These fiery fiends are eager to see what you would look like
immersed in flames. Put them down before they render you
to dust.Page | 30
THE UNHOLY TRINITY
The leaders of the Shadow Cult are master practioners of the dark arts.
They each come armed with special powers and they will use those powers
to their fullest extent in order to annihilate you.
JILIAYA: THE WITCH
It has been said that Jiliaya was responsible for summoning
the wraiths from their infernal abodes below. If this is true,
then you can only imagine what powers she wields.
DROGE: THE WARLOCK
The supreme commander of the High Order has such sights
to show you. Being both a master pistoleer and a master
deceptor, Droge will be one of your greatest challenges
ZAGAN: THE ANTIPOPE
Legend has it that Zagan is a reincarnation of Pope Benedict
IX, a cruel and dissolute 11th century Pope who has been
described as "a demon from hell in the disguise of a priest."
Considering the catholic-style hierarchy of the Shadow Cult and Zagan's
title, the legend may not be such a far-fetched theory.Page | 31
HINTS & STRATEGIES
THE ART OF COMBAT
THE BASICS: The enemies you face will stop at nothing to hurl you back
into the grave whence you came, so you'll need to familiarize yourself with
your surroundings as well as each weapon in your arsenal (including
inventory items as they can be very useful for getting you out of sticky
situations). Hiding behind walls and knowing which weapon to use in any
given situation can save your unlife.
It is also important to know which weapon works best against certain
enemies. General cultists and zombies can be easily dispatched with pistol
type weapons, but won't be as effective against stronger enemies, such as
High Order cult members, elite guards, and bosses. (Helpful Hint -
Werewolves are immune to anything that isn't silver or fire).
MELEE COMBAT: When it comes to melee combat, sticking and moving is
the best strategy as your kick and machete attacks stun most lower end
enemies. Dispatching of dogs and bats with your machete or a well-placed
kick is a good way of preserving ammo as these enemies go down easily.
Avoid using your fists unless it is absolutely necessary. Without a Berserk
Mask in use, fighting with your fists will usually result in getting seriously
hurt or killed.
DON'T WASTE AMMO: Using a weapon's secondary fire indiscriminately
can be fun, but also eats through your ammo very quickly. It is best to only
use a weapon's secondary fire in situations that call for it.Page | 32
PLAYING WITH FIRE: As awesome as Sartana's infernal power can be, it
is wise to only use it sparingly as your energy supply is very limited. Being
overwhelmed by hordes of cultists or major boss battles are good situations
to use it.
Note about wraiths - don't bother wasting Devil's Mule ammo, infernal
scrolls or your infernal power on them--they will have no effect on them.
Gun the flaming bastards down.
USE INVENTORY ITEMS WISELY: It's wise not to waste inventory items.
Use them only when certain situations call for them.
Eyes of the Owl - You'll want to use these often as Beyond the Grave is a
world of darkness. There are usually plenty of these around. Owl Eyes
make your enemies easier to see, therefore making it easier to dispatch of
them.
Poppets - Good for immobilizing groups of enemies or fast moving enemies
like executioners, werewolves, and certain cultists. Keep in mind: the more
powerful the foe, the less effective poppets become.
Infernal scrolls - Use these for obliterating large clusters of lesser enemies or

taking down a particularly tough foe.
Book of the Dead - Save these for areas that are flooded with enemies. It'll
make your life easier. It is helpful to note that these books are usually
placed close to areas where they might be advantageous to use.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The number of Crystal Balls and Books of the Dead
you have do not carry on to the next level. For example: let's say you
collected two crystal balls on level 2; if you don't use them on that level,
you will lose them once you reach next level.Page | 33
FINDING SECRETS
Some secrets are marked. If you notice an oddball item (like an out of place
candle) placed in front of a wall, there is a chance that it could be a secret.
Crystal Balls - Crystal Balls can save you on time and trouble when it comes
to locating secrets. You won't be able to find all of the game's secrets with
just Crystal Balls, but you should at least be able to find some.
WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER
Most enemies you kill leave behind trinkets, guns/ammo, armor, and
blood for you to loot. The more powerful the foe, the better the loot. Note:
the hearts dropped by Archbishops and Cardinals are especially nutritious.
Consuming them gives you life above the 100 point mark (by the time you
get to the later levels, you will want them).
GREED PAYS OFF
Don't overlook collecting treasure, especially treasure chests. Collecting
treasure is a great way to boost your score. For every 100,000 points you
earn, your life jumps up to 300. Also, you are given bonuses for every 10
treasure chests you collect. A particularly special bonus awaits you if you
find all the treasure chests in the game.
TREASURE CHEST BONUS BREAK-DOWN:
10 Treasure Chests -- +10,000 points, maximum wards given, +1 to
treasure chest count
20 Treasure Chests -- +25,000 points, maximum wards increased by 2, +1
to treasure chest count
30 Treasure Chests -- +50,000 points, maximum wards given, +1 to
treasure chest count, 600 points of life!Page | 34
SECRET LEVELS
There are 2 secret levels in the game. For those wanting the complete
playing experience for Beyond the Grave, it is recommended to find and
complete these levels. Note: You won’t be able to acquire all the treasure
chests without completing these levels. Also, one of these levels has a secret
weapon not mentioned in this manual.
VIEWING MAPS
If you want to view the level maps for Beyond the Grave (not in game), you
will have to download Havoc's Wolf3d Editor (just google it if you don't
have it already). ChaosEdit or MapEdit won't work since Beyond the Grave
uses a 128x128 map grid.
WANT MORE HINTS?
Are you stuck on a level? Are you having difficulties defeating a certain
boss? If so, feel free to e-mail me (see Contacting the Author section). Don't
ask me for cheats. There aren't any and I don't plan on releasing any.Page | 35
