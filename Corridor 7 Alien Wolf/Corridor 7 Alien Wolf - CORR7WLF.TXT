Corridor 7 : Alien Wolf  

   This is a Wolfenstein 3-D shareware graphics patch that converts your 
game into Corridor 7 : Alien Invasion.

   The following text has been adapted from Loren G. Dobert's DOOMenstein 
documentation.  That patch can be found in America Online's software library,
and on various Wolfenstein web sites as DOOMSTEN.ZIP.  I highly recommend it.

        II. WHY
       III. WHEN
        IV. WHAT
         V. The Problems

I. WHO
First of all, the credits:
        id software for creating Wolfenstein
        Capstone Software for creating Corridor 7
        Apogee software for the distribution thing
        Blackadder (Michael Adcock) and Loren G. Dobert for inspiration
        Andy Nonymous for slicing and dicing the ingredients

II. WHY
After the success of the BlakenStone patch, I hungered for another game
to hack that used the Wolfenstein engine.  So I came upon Corridor 7. 

III. WHEN
I started this about the first week of November, 1995 and finished on 
November 19. Changed landscape panels to space panels January 19, 1999.

IV. WHAT
The following programs were used in creating this patch:

V. The Problems

My BlakenStone project experience smoothed the way for this one, technically.
The main problems here were mostly aesthetic.

V1. Walls
Using QuickBasic programming, I extracted the binary data from the Corridor 7
VSWAP and inserted it into a Wolfenstein VSWAP, then viewed the results
with Wolfedit. I wrote another program to extract a wall from the Wolf VSWAP, 
change the binary data to what I thought was a close match to how the colors 
should look (batch file), and re-insert the data. Some walls were easier than 
others, some trial and error was used. Walls and doors with see-through holes
would not have the holes after transferring to Wolfenstein.

V2. The Objects
I used the same methods as above. Did some re-sizing, as most of the inert
objects in Corridor 7 are much larger than Wolf's.

V3. Enemies
Mostly sizing problems here. Also used the same color scheme as above. Here's 
a commentary on each:
        
        Brown Guards replaced with Green Robot-Eyes. Best fit character-wise,
        but I wish I didn't have to reduce the size to fit. Couldn't id
        have made the brown soldiers fatter ??? :)

        SS Guards replaced with Short Gremlin. Again, had to resize, since
        this character is quite squat compared with the SS guard. He's also 
        a deeper green now...pretend he has a moontan after vacationing
        in the Ring Nebula !

        The Dogs replaced with Blue Biological-Eyes. Resized again, came out  
        OK. In all cases, the resizing has resulted in a slight loss of
        detail, but not enough to cause a grainy or pixelated appearance.

        Hans Gr”sse replaced with the Yellow Robot. Great fit, thematically
        and physically. No resizing needed. Could only use 2 of 4 shooting
        frames, and couldn't use all of the original death frames, but it 
        came out great anyway.

V4. You and your weapons
Not too difficult... 

        The knife I left as is. 

        The pistol replaced with the single-shot hand gun. 

        The machine gun replaced with the semi-automatic hand gun.

        The chaingun replaced with the alien dual blaster.

        Your victory run. Gave BJ a helmet and brown shades, and cleaned
        up his clothes - no more blood and rips.

V5. Sounds
All sounds were recorded on tape and WAV files were created from the tape,
edited and re-inserted using WLFAUD. The Yellow Robot does not make a sound 
when he dies, so I substituted the death sound of the Thor-like guard, which
sounds kind of "liquid-y". 

I hope you enjoy the patch!
