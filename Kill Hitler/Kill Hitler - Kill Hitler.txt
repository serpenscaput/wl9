Plays as Episode 6.


Same story line follows.

Levels of Interest:

Level 1: This is the entrance in the sewer of the castle your mission begins here.(Of 
course)
Level 8: Barrier, This level is heavy armed trying to protect hitler on the next 
floor. Some parts will be easy, some hard. You have to find secert passages to get 
health and ammo.  BECAREFUL WHERE YOU SAVE, THERE ARE PARTS WHERE IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, 
THERE IS NO WAY OUT!!!
Level 9: This is where you face hitler, you will see other bosses while on the floor. 
Again, mostly you will need to find secert passages to find heath and ammo.
After you kill him the games over, You WIN!

I've only tested this game in the mode "Can I Play Daddy?"
Don't tell me anything about changing or fixing anything by that.

Enjoy!
