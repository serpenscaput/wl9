Here's a new mapset by Ipank7000, 15 new challenging levels (some of them from my 
Ipank7000's Mapset) .Feel free to use them as your own project
but please give me credit if you use them ;). You need your own registered 
wolf3d vswap to play this mapset.

There are some code changes in this mapset:
* SS always drop machinegun
* New skill difficulty
* Schabbs drop silver key
* Blocking code (thanks to MCS) 
* Avoid getting lower weapon if you get the higher one
* Spear and Wolf3d music (thanks to Luke Strauman)
* Par times and ceiling colours have been changes
* Map's name show when loading screens
