Hello there people of the Wolfenstein3D community!
Just wanted to drop a note..

This is the first mod I have ever created.
It dates from december the 1st, 2002 ( I was 14 at the time and now I'm 20!:-) )

I was about to throw some CDs when I saw this one so I ran a fast scan on it for 
any goodies that
Could be inside. And there it was, Laying for 6 long years! my first mod ( feels 
proud :'-) )
I made this mod when I've just found out about this wonderful community.
This game never had a storyline so if you want you can think of one, I was never

Good at storylines. Anyway, I'm running out of words so I'll make it a quick one.


This game is dedicated to my good friends E marcos Levit (Eyal) and to Tamir Kastiel 
that has left for Canada :(
