This is a pre-made .boxer (gamebox) file for Adam Biser’s “The Orb of Dilaaria”, 
a freeware stand-alone Wolfenstein 3D mod. TOoD is a first-person fantasy combat 
game which is equal parts Heretic and Wolfenstein, with a little bit from first-person 
blastfests like Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and dungeon crawls like the Elder Scrolls 
for good measure. 

Instructions: 
1. Download and install Boxer, from http://www.boxerapp.com
2. Place this .boxer file in Boxer’s DOS Games folder (default is ~/Documents/DOS 
Games, I believe)
3. Double click to play game.

If for any reason you need to access the game’s files “under the hood”, simply control-click/right-click 
on the file and select “Show Package Contents”. This gamebox was created using Boxer 
1.3 (2012-05-29) and will run on any Macintosh that supports Boxer 1.x, including 
PPC-based Macintosh computers running 10.5+. (Note that this game requires that Boxer 
be installed first.) See http://boxerapp.com/releasenotes for details. To run the 
game in fullscreen, press CMD-F, as per Boxer’s controls.
