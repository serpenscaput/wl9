	As explained in OVERKILL.DOC, these are "tourist" maps: they 
	show the basic floorplan of each level in Castle Schmenge, 
	but they don't reveal the locations of guards, food, ammo, 
	first aid kits, or treasure.  They also don't show secret rooms,
	though by studying the maps closely you can usually spot likely
	places to check; if you were designing a medieval Teutonic 
	castle, would you put a secret room behind this wall?  Give it
	a push and find out.

	These maps were created using WOLFMAP v1.2, by David Lummis;
	I customized them by deleting or replacing certain objects and 
	symbols.  They can be printed on any printer that supports the 
	IBM graphics character set; they look fine on my HP Deskjet 500.
	WOLFMAP can be used to create maps that show the location of 
	every important item in the game; it is available on many BBS's.

	The new levels themselves were created using MAPEDIT (v4.1 by
	Bill Kirby, v7.0 mod by Dave Huntoon, Bryan Baker, and Matt
	Gruson).  To create the levels I used Wolfenstein 3-D registered
	version v1.4; they _will not_ work with any version of the 
	shareware game, and they _might_ not work with earlier versions
	of the registered game, though some testing was done with v1.1.
	The only problem I saw with registered v1.4 was occasional
	re-sizing of the view window after your character gets killed;
	if this happens, just press F5 to reset window size to your
	preference.  No fatal crashes were seen with v1.4; in v1.1,
	the game would sometimes dump me to DOS with an error message
	saying "MM_GetPtr: Out of Memory!" after my character was  
	killed.  I advise only using v1.4 if possible.

	"Operation: Overkill" was created with the hardcore Wolf3D 
	gamer in mind; it was intended to be played at maximum 
	difficulty level (I Am Death Incarnate), and virtually all
	of my playtesting was done at that level.  Although there
	are many more guards and much less food/health/ammo than
	in the original Wolf3D, I stayed true to the original in
	one respect: both of the keys are in normal rooms, though
	usually heavily guarded.  Theoretically, you can finish
	"Overkill" without finding any of the secret rooms, though
	I don't recommend trying.  My advice: be extremely cautious,
	aim carefully, and if you find a chaingun, use it sparingly:
	it uses up ammo at a rapid pace, and there's not that much 
	of it around.  If your health and ammo are maxed out, be 
	afraid: there's probably something heinous waiting around
	the next corner.  If you find some food or bullets and can't
	use them, remember where they are, because you'll probably
	need to go back for them later.

	Good luck, and happy hunting.
