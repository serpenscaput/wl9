This is just a handful of leftover stuff from TW that I couldn't really find a place for in the game. I made them all new. Feel free to use them however you want, thanks would be apprieciated.

Along with the textures, is also included a stencil so you can make your own color variations of the brik pattern,
As well as an OLD hud I was using for TW in it's early days. (It was created march 4, 2003). There is also sprites for the pistol weapon, which vaguely resembles a walther ^_^, and a static sprite of some wooden beams.
You can tweak and alter any of these to your needs - good luck!
