=====================
NOTE ABOUT SAVE GAMES - No extra objects will be saved in a save game. Uniforms, 
bandoliers, and Adrenaline shots will dissapear from inventory when you load the 
game. Keys, lives, health, ammo, and missiles however; will save properly.
=====================
=====================
NOTE ABOUT RANDOM CRASHES - After thourough playtesting, I've noticed the game randomly 
crashes from time to time. Therefor I recommend you save OFTEN. At least save at 
the start, middle, and end of each level.
=====================


- Sometimes when you pick up a uniform object it immediately disappears from the 
inventory. If you pick up another it will act normally. (Not fixed)

- When the uniform time runs out the uniform goes away normally, but on the HUD the 
image is garbled. This was a VSWAP error and does not affect gameplay. (Not fixed)


- Between levels, bandolier, tablets, and adrenaline will dissappear from the hud. 
They will still be usable, and in the inventory, however. Uniform disguises do NOT 
carry over between levels. This does not affect gameplay. (Not fixed)





==========
NOT BUGS:
==========

- On level 11 you are supposed to be stuck behind the sandbags holding off numerous 
enemies. After about 4-5 minutes an enemy will open the gold locked door on the left 
and you'll be free to leave. YES the level is possible, I've beaten it several times 
on all difficulties.

- While driving, you CANNOT pick up weapons. Fortunately, you can't be hurt by barbed 
wire in the car either.

- In some secret areas, there are pushwall puzzles, that if done incorrectly, can 
block off any entrance to the rest of the secret area. There are no pushwalls that 
can stop you from finishing a level.

- If your health is below 40, it slowly goes down lower automatically to simulate 
bleeding to death. To stop the bleeding, raise your health above 45.
