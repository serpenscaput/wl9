Introduction

Unsung, is World War I adventure in Wolfenstein 3D,
it lets you slog through the trenches in true pixelated
FPS fashion. Along the way as you fight through the
German trenchs as an Allied Trench Raider in an attempt
to disable a crucial German Artillery Bunker, you had
better watch out for machine gun nests, flamethrowers,
poison gas, and an army of soldiers out to kill you.

Based off Wolf4SDL code, Unsung is a stand alone
mod which does not require dosbox to run on Vista or
Windows 7. With new graphics, sounds, levels, and
weapons, prepare for a whole new Wolfenstein 3D
experience. 

====================================================
Running/Installation

Unzip the files to what ever file location you like,
and run the file unsung.exe. So long as all the files
are in the same directory everything should be fine.

If you would like to run the game in windowed mode
instead of fullscreen, create a shortcut and add the
following to the target window in the shortcuts
properties.

--windowed

For example so that it would look some thing like this.

C:\Unsung\unsung.exe --windowed

====================================================

Controls

The game controls are pretty much the basics as would
be expected in any other FPS. The only new additions
to stock Wolfenstein 3D are the following two.

H = Use Health kit
R = Reload weapon

For further information check the manual section in
game.
