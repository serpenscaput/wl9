WEX60 Hint
Book
Document version: 1.0
Written by The Torpid Rodriguez
in 2020.2
This document contains information about the Extreme 60 maps, which is an
unofficial Wolfenstein-3D level package.
The legendary Wolfenstein-3D have created by id Software in 1992.
The WEX60 levels have created with the great ChaosEdit! www.chaossoftware.de.vu between 2009-2020 by me.
I started to study Wolfenstein levels with CE in 2009. Back then I just wanted to
create an entire level by myself. Then created two more, and I decided to make a
whole episode. Then I want all six episodes. And by 2020, I have finished with
all sixty levels. As a matter of course, you cannot make exactly as many levels
as needed, I created a little more, and have rejected some.
Note: Originally I was not intended to make changes in the source code of the
executable. I want my levels to work with the original program. That is why the
secret level entrance order in Extreme 60 is the same as in the original
Wolfenstein-3D levels.
Please don't play in “Can I play, Daddy?" or “Don't
hurt me.” mode: You will be bored, and I will be
pissed!

L: this key is necessary to complete this level

L6 The frightened Nazis barricaded themselves, while others fled, and the corridors were walled down
behind them. You must find the hidden golden key to complete this level! You must alert a certain
officer in area “A” to alert his twin in area “B” to unblock an essential pushwall in area “B”. Good luck!
L7 You must find the hidden silver key first. Good luck!

BL The Boss lurks almost at the center of the map. He got the golden key for his office, but you need to
find the silver key too. Good luck!
In case if you are unfamiliar with the Wolfenstein-3D world, or just want to get used to it,
below here are the simplified maps for the first episode, except the secret level. The grey
areas on the maps are the corridors and rooms where you can move. White rectangle around a
wall on the map means that wall is a pushwall. You can push it with the Use key, the same
key with which you use to open doors. White letter “E” means an end-of-episode trigger, the
level and the episode will be completed when you step on it. (No soldiers, monsters, dogs,
food, treasure items, and other non-blocking items have marked. I’ve also omitted floor codes
and direction markings. I redraw most of the markings to make it identifiable for those who
are not familiar with CE.):4

L1 You must find the hidden silver and golden keys to complete this level. The final elevator is hidden.
You can check the map of E5-M1 on page 14. Good luck!
L2 You must find the hidden path to proceed to the center of the level. Good luck! Note: Max secret is 66%
here, sorry!
L3 Memorize the door you leave because you must go back exactly there, opening any other door just
deliver you a quick death, BJ! Good luck!
L4 Don't let you killed by the grey monsters! Attack them from behind! To do this you will need the silver
key, which is in the labyrinth. This labyrinth can't be just walked through with the well-serving alwaysturn-left method. Be strenuous! (Or do whatever you want.) Good luck!
L5 You must find the hidden silver OR the hidden golden key to complete this level. You also have to be
lucky to find the hidden golden key. Stop when you see "Verboten", it says: Paranormal danger ahead!
You can check the map of E5-M5 on page 15. Good luck! Note: Max secret is 83% here, sorry!
SL Good luck!
L6 You must find the hidden silver key to complete this level. The final elevator is hidden. You will have
one extra life at the beginning of the level, and two med kits awaiting you after you acquired the golden
key. These three are the only health items on this level! Use bullets rather than being hurt! Be quick
after you enter the silver key door, because only Hans has the golden key, and he is behind a golden key
door, someone will open the door inside, but right after you must enter to wake up the boss, otherwise
you'll never be able to complete this level! Good luck!
L7 Be smart! Good luck!
L8 The final elevator is hidden. This level contains a puzzle. If you proceed without solving the puzzle, you
will be killed in seconds, Mr. Blazkowicz! (Except in baby mode.) (Unfortunately, those demonic
smokes sometimes break out spontaneously, so it is advisable to save often in different slots to be able
to continue the game when it happens.) Save the game when you enter this level, and keep it untouched!
You can check the puzzle in E5-M8 on page 15. Good luck! Please ignore the secret score here!
BL Shoot Schabbs! Good luck!13

SL Surprise! Is this the Boss level? No, it can't be.. But it is, just in an earlier stage! Sludge break yet is a
minor problem. Improve the opportunity, and look around! Good luck!
L4 You must find the hidden golden key to complete this level. Good luck!

(and forth) to the silver key door located in the first room. You can check the map of E6-M5 on page
16. Good luck!
L6 You must find the hidden golden key to complete this level. As you get the golden key, something
startling will happen: The two keys melting together, and you will have only one bronze key that will
open every door, EVERY DOOR. Good luck! You will need it.
L7 **You shouldn’t open every pushwall on this level. If you open the wrong pushwall, you will be chased
by demons. Check the map E6-M7 on page 17. Good luck! Besides, if you not open all pushwall, your
secret ratio will not be 100%.
L8 Good luck!
BL Déjà vu, or isn't? Since then, sludge break grew serious, obstructing the south side of the bunker.
Fortunately, Hitler is lurking somewhere near here... Halt Hitler! You can check the map of E6-M9 on
