Welcome to FOXENSTEIN 3D

By the Silver Fox, 2010.

Version 1.0

NEW FEATURES:

1.	Seamless level progression.
2.	Seven different weapons.
3.	New enemies.
4.	Four keys.
5.	Textured flats (optional).
6.	Shading (optional).
7.	Ingame messages (optional).
8.	Portable medkits.
9.	And more, and more, and more.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1.	Run the game with 'noshade' param to disable some advanced features,
	like shading, textured flats and ingame messages. This will return
	the classic Wolf3d atmosphere.
2.	Some columns and barrels can be destroyed by shooting them for enough.
	Note that when you destory a barrel, it will explode and hurt all
	nearby characters including you.
3.	Don't let wounded enemies run away, these bastards can pick up healing
	items.
4.	When a rocket hits a wall, it hurts all nearby characters, even the one
	who launched it. Some enemies are smart enough to avoid shooting rockets
	if they are afraid of hitting a wall too close.

KNOWN BUGS:

1.	Sometimes all the static objects on the level may somehow become
	invisible. That happens very, very rarely, so I can't discover what
	exactly causes that. If you see all statics became invisible, just
	save your game, quit program and start it again.

HINTS/TIPS:

1.	I recomend you to save on a different slot when entering a secret level.
	Some secret levels have large amount of secret doors and you can stuck
	inside.
2.	Save on a different slot at the beginning of levels 26 and 33.
	Trust me.
