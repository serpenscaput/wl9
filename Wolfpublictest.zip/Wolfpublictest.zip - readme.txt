Hi ;D

Thank you for downloading the testversion of our wolfenstein 3d engine!
As the name "testversion" suggests, it still contains many bugs, so don't think you'll 
see a perfect programm!
The maps delivered in this package were NOT REALLY written for this engine *gg* They've 
been built up when there was only fog, fullscreen and respawning! This package is 
only released to show you the things possible to do with our wolf3d engine!
Make sure that you have plenty of free main memory or you won't be able to see the 
fullscreen mode. Also you should disable sound coz it also takes much memory.
Here an overview of the map specific features (or something like that ;) ) :

   1. level: sky+snow+floor
   2. level: sky+rain+floor
   3. level: sky+floor
   4. level: ceiling+floor

Of course you will also notice, that the textures aren't that good for this features, 
but it's just a testversion to show you, what is possible!

For those who don't want to go through those levels to see other feature sets start 
the programm with "wolf chaos" at the command line.
With the normal <SHIFT>+<ALT>+<BACKSPACE> you get into debug mode and then you can 
warp with <TAB>+W into the levels. Don't warp into levels after level 6 (or 7??), 
because I'm not sure what will happen because of the floor and ceiling sets which 
aren't available for later maps.

So, have fun while staring at your monitor and don't forget to sign our guestbook 
;)
