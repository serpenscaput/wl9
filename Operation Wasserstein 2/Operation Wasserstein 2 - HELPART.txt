^C[Red]								OPERATION: WASSERSTEIN II
^c00
The story thus far.

It has been six days since you infiltrated Castle Schwangau. Reichsmarshall Wasser and his insane associate, Dr. von Richter, are dead -- along with the fruit of their depravity: that hideous, superhuman Ubermensche. Making your way out of the Castle, suddenly an alarm sounds, and the hurried shouts of guards are heard. Grabbing your weapons, you rush headlong down the mountainside.

^P
Far in the distance you see the tops of trees below. The dark forest beckons, but the guards are closing in. You won't get out of this without a fight. BJ, do what you do best: destroy the enemy, escape from Castle Schwangau, and report back to Allied Command about Operation: Wasserstein.

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through.

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum,
Kept beating, beating, till I thought
My mind was going numb.

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again.
-Emily Dickinson

Operation: Wasserstein was twenty years in the making, and I am pleased to say this sequel has not taken quite so long! I have attempted to maintain the original atmosphere and gameplay of Wolfenstein 3D, as seen through my 1990s childhood imagination. Given the level of detail I have incorporated, the game is best played at higher resolutions. 

I suggest the `Recommended` skill level. For a major challenge, choose `Extreme!`.

Keep in mind: secrets are your friend! Though there are no mandatory secrets, it will often be difficult to proceed without the goodies offered within them!

I wish to thank all those whose artistic work influenced or contributed to this mod. I sincerely hope you enjoy my small offering to the Wolfenstein community.
