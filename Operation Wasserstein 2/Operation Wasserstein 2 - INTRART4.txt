^C[Red]TOTAL DESTRUCTION							
^c00 The commander gasps for breath, but a final bullet in the skull ends his tyranny. Rifling through his coat pockets, you find a handwritten note bearing the SS runes. Addressed to Hauptsturmfuhrer J. Schmidt, the note reads: 'My dear Schmidt, the time is hastening. The events at Schwangau leave us little choice but to go ahead with testing. I have advised Dr. Eisenstadt to begin transferring his little pets to the firing ranges. They shall make excellent fodder for our new Peacemaker. H.H.'
