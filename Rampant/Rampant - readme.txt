Thank you for downloading Rampant. This readme file will explain how
to set the game up, as well as some helpful hints and info about the
levels. There are also a few new never-seen-before surprises
incorporated into Rampant.

-- INSTALLATION STEP ONE
Make sure you are running the latest release of LZWOLF. You can obtain
the latest version from a public Dropbox URL:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x77td0qm2ze9x2z/AABGD7mHPMPMWMwkp8OEH2yla?dl=0

Download and extract lzwolf-1.3.99999_x64.zip if you are running on a
64-bit OS. Otherwise download and extract lzwolf-1.3.99999_x86.zip.

-- INSTALLATION STEP TWO
Buy and install the full version of Spear of Destiny through Steam. If
you did not purchase and install the game from Steam, but still own a
copy of Spear of Destiny, copy the game files to your LZWOLF folder.


---RUNNING THIS ADD-ON
Simply drag and drop the PK3 add-on onto your LZWOLF executable. The
add-on should then launch successfully. Select Spear Of Destiny as
your base game if a selection pop-up is displayed.

Once in the game, select the New Game Menu and your preferred level of
difficulty.

---STORYLINE
A new Allied Intelligence spy, named William J. Blazkowicz, is sent on
a mission to locate the Spear of Destiny and stop Hitler from
capturing it.

The Allied command knew very well the only way to achieve this
objective was for the new recruit to face an execution ordered by
Hitler himself - in order to bring the Allied spy closer to the Nazi's
search expedition for the Spear of Destiny.

At the start of this add-on, the Allied spy must fight his execution
by any means necessary in order to stop Hitler and the Nazi search
expedition from capturing the Spear of Destiny.

---NEW GRAPHICS
Credits are owed to the following Wolfers for their contributions in
new graphics:
        * Atina for her excellent classically inspired art additions
        * Dunkelschwamm for his awesome Boss Generator!

---NEW MAPS INSPIRATIONS
Credits are owed to the following Wolfers as some of the new maps are
based heavily on their work:
        * 10 New Ones by Thomas Weiling
        * Schabbs 2000 by Gary Ragland

---THE UNITS
The game, which consists of 5 main levels and 1 secret level, is
broken up into several 'units', each with a different theme and
objective. This is a very important section to read because it is very
helpful for some of the units:

   UNIT 1 --- Death March   (level 1)
This first unit starts the player off in a heavily scripted level
where BJ's execution is about to take place. The player must look for
ways to help BJ escape his execution and then follow it up by
defeating a large contingent of Nazi personnel. This unit tells the
story of how the new recruit escapes his first execution in a
spectacular display of survival and combat skill.

   UNIT 2 --- Only Human    (levels 2-4)
The next unit, consisting of 3 levels, flows more like a traditional
Wolfenstein/Spear add-on with a few surprises included along the
way. It features heavy combat, item management and navigational
challenges. The mapping is inspired heavily by the original Spear of
Destiny, the work of Thomas Weiling and the work of Gary Ragland (see
Credits above). This unit tells the Story of how the new recruit
fights his way closer to the leader of the Nazi search expedition for
the Spear of Destiny - Franz von Krueger!

   UNIT 3 --- No Escape     (levels 5)
The final unit, consisting of a single map, is actually the size of
two maps combined into one. In this unit you face the final boss who
leads the Nazi search expedition for the Spear of Destiny. Be ready to
go to war when you face Franz von Krueger. It is rumoured Franz likes
to force his subdued victims to stare into the eyes of his four
Gargoyle statues. The four Gargoyles are somehow symbolic to him of
the power of the Spear of Destiny.

--- You may have noticed that level 6 is missing above. That is
    because it is a secret level which is reached off of level 4. Its
    pretty well hidden and VERY bizzare. Check it out at your own risk
    (you might not get back up to the original levels).

---NEW MUSIC
Music has been selected to set an appropriate tone for the Story of
this add-on. Even within a single map music may change as a way of
telling the Story. Music has been converted from MIDI tracks from the
one or more of the following classic-era games:
        * Heretic and Hexen
        * Warcraft
        * Little Big Adventure
        * Shadow of the Beast
        * Duke Nukem 3D

---CREDITS

   Special Thanks to:
	  Astrocreep - For encouraging me to make a mod as a mostly
	               solo effort.

	  Atina	     - For her art additions and support as a modder.

	  Braden "Blzut3" Obrzut - For making ECWolf, the base project
	                           for LZWolf. This mod would not
	                           exist without ECWolf.

Feel free to distribute this add-on, but ONLY if it remains unaltered
and includes this text file.
