^c27SECRET LEVEL FOUND
^c00
You have found the forest's secret level (although the level is not a forest). This 
one is based on level E1L2. Here, instead of a time limit, you'll have to run for 
your life, as your health will decrease by one point every 2 seconds. The level has 
a clear path to its end elevator, but you should check out the "useless" rooms if 
you want to survive.
