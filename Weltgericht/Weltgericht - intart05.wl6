^c27WILLIE'S DOMAIN
^c00
This is the first boss you will encounter. He is called Willie, because Willie is 
just like a Willie. He is a mutant creation made by the Nazis according to the information 
given by the remaining scientists, and he is equipped with a chain gun and a rocket 
launcher. Willie holds the key to the next floor's elevator, and will be waiting 
for you at the end.
