^c27SECRET LEVEL ATTAINED
^c00
You're in the temple's secret level. It is based on E1L4. You'll only find monster-like 
enemies here. The time limit is applied to your ammunition. Every time that 1:30 
minutes passes, all your weapons will have their ammo reduced by 3 (rifle by 2). 
The level has a lot of supplies, but they are not unlimited. You must be fast or 
you won't be able to reach the elevator before killing the monsters with your super 
knife.
