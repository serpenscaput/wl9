Ipank7000's Mapset #2 (Spear of Destiny version)                               7 June 2020

After long hiatus from doing anything with Wolf3D due to college and work stuff, here's another SOD mapset by Ipank7000, 21 new levels.
Feel free to use them in your own project but please give me credit if you use them. 
You need your own registered SOD audio and VSWAP to play this mapset.

Also, You need the SOD's executable to run this game (of course). 
Either ECWolf, SOD4SDL for DOS (DOS is strongly NOT recommended though).

Suggestion, question, bug report:    
- email @ ipank7000@gmail.com
- PM me in DHW forum (Ipank7000) or in Wolf3d Haven forum (Ipank7000)
	
Enough reading...start playing!

Hope you enjoy it!!!
