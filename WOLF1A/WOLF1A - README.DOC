WOLFENSTEIN 3-D Add-On

Included herewith are two files that provide ten new levels for
the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3-D (tm).  These files replace
the equivalently named files that were provided with the original
program.  (Note that this product will only work with the shareware
version 1.1 of Wolfenstein 3-D.)

Before installing, I recommend that you first copy the two original
files so that they may be retrieved later.  These files are:

    MAPHEAD.WL1   and   MAPTEMP.WL1

You should copy these into MAPHEAD.SAV and MAPTEMP.SAV.

Note that any saved games will be rendered inoperable once you install
this add-on.  If you would like to be able to recall these saved games
(after recalling the original MAPxxxx files), you should back them up
before installing the add-on files.  Saved game files are named
SAVGAMx.WL1 (where x is a digit from 0 to 9).  Copy these into
SAVGAMx.SAV before installing the new MAP files.

After backing up any desired files, simply copy the included files into
your Wolfenstein 3-D directory.
