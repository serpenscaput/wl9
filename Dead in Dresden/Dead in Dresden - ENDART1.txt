^C7eCONGRATULATIONS!
^C00After shredding Von Braun's body to pulp with chaingun fire to be sure, you dutifully gather as much kerosene, petrol and flammable solvent as you can locate in the bunker, slathering every surface as you make your way to the entrance.

^C7eCONGRATULATIONS!
^C00Standing just outside the doorway, you fling a single match onto a pile of oily rags prepared just for the occasion and confidently stride up the concrete steps as the conflagration fills the bunker. Thanks to your actions, Von Braun's research, his test subjects and any evidence of your presence in Dresden have been definitively erased from history.

^c7eNOW WHAT?
^c00
Having succeeded in your mission, you contemplate how you are to return home. With no evacuation expected or planned, your only hope is to fight your way through eastern Germany and link up with the Soviet army on their advance west. Grinning and raising your MP40, you set out on the first steps of your long journey home.
