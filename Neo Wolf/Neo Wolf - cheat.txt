Cheating


Hold [I]+[L]+[M] at any time and you get all the keys, guns, 100 life and 99
ammo but your score is set to zero.

If you run NeoWolf in cheat mode here's what you gotta do to start cheating.
Hold [Left SHIFT]+[ALT]+[BACKSPACE] to go into debuging mode.  Then you can
use any of the following commands.

[TAB]+[W] - lets you warp to any level(1 being the first, 9 the last and 10
            the secret.)
[TAB]+[G] - God Mode(degreelessness mode)
[TAB]+[I] - Gives you +100000 points, 100 life, more ammo and the next gun
[TAB]+[X] - Extra Stuff(I dunno)
[TAB]+[H] - Hurt Yourself
[TAB]+[S] - Slow motion(great...)
[TAB]+[E] - Exit the floor
[TAB]+[B] - Let's you change the border color
[TAB]+[T] - Let's you view images and info of all the walls and sprites
[TAB]+[C] - Level info
[TAB]+[M] - Memory info
[TAB]+[V] - Adds extra VBLs(Vertical Blanking Signal) Pretty much useless.
