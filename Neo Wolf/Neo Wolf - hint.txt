Hints


First let me state some things about NeoWolf:

-No necessary keys or elevators are hidden
-Everything needed to defeat the boss(ammo, health)is located within the level
-The difficulty levels go like this:
 -very easy
 -easy
 -challenging
 -insanely difficult


Here are some general hints:

-If your having trouble completing a level:
 -save more often
 -if your playing the 'insanely difficult' difficulty level try the
  'challenging' level
 -If you can't find any secrets you could use MapEdit(sorta cheating... but
  if you don't care I don't care!)


Specific hints:

-Level 7
        This level is kinda hard.  I don't want you to abandon the game or
 anything so read this.  After you have grabbed the machine gun and see the
 large amassment of guards, hide behind a wall and pick off one the guys in
 the back; now that they're all ready to lynch you RUN back into either of the
 two small-corridor-areas scoop up bunches of ammo and any health you might
 need.  Then peek your head out of the area and the guards should have started
 coming.  Blast away until you either need health or ammo or both then run
 back into the area and scoop more goodies.  Now you have to fight them in the
 small corridors(cool!!!).  When your done go grab the silver(blue) key
 where all the guys were; open the locked door near it and get your reward...
 CHAIN GUN!(wouldn't THAT have come in handy earlier... heheh :)  Now it
 should be easy to mow down the rest of the guys in the level not to mention
 the next!  Oh, yeah, and I would suggest saving at this level.  It may take
 a few tries.


email me and tell me what levels you need help with.
