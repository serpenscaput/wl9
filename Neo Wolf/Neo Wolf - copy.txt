Cyber-Grosse


        During the course of this project it has come to my attention that
someone else has already made a Terminator style Hans Grosse;  Nate of Schabbs
Resurection.  I have talked to him about this and because he actually came up
with the idea first I said I would remove my Hans-Grosse from NeoWolf if it
truly bothered him.  He said it was alright so... Hans stays.  So nobody go
pointing fingers saying I copied.  I hadn't even seen his add-on until after
I had drawn my Hans.  Yes, I drew it myself... pixel by pixel.
