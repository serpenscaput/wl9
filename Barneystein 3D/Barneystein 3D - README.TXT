                              BARNEYSTEIN 3-D

The infamous Barney Patch!
For Wolfenstein 3D shareware version 1.4

The original version of the Barney Patch was made for shareware version 1.0
It has been converted to run with version 1.4

To run the patch:
Copy VSWAP.WL1 into the Wolfenstein directory. This will overwrite the
original file of this name. (Make a backup of the original before doing this)

Please note that this patch is NOT sanctioned by Apogee or ID software,
so if you have problems with it . . TOO BAD!
