You found the temple's secret level. It is based on E1L4. You'll only find monster-like enemies here. The time limit is used on your ammunition. Everytime that 01:30 minutes passes, all your weapons will have its ammo reduced by 3 (rifle by 2). The level has a lot of suplies, but won't lasts forever. You must be fast or you won't be able to find the elevator without kill monsters with your super knife.
