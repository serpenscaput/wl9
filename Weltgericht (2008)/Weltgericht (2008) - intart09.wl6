^c27SCIENTISTS OF DOOM
^c00
We discovered that the survivor scientists group is in this floor. Their number are exactly 20 members. This place has a giant central square where they are located. The square has 4 doors and a swastika-like room in the center, where more scientists are hidden. There are also small rooms outside the square with some of them. Those guys are protected by the weird black creature.
You have to kill them all in 27:00 minutes, or they will leave and they will be able to continue the abomination process.
