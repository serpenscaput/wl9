^c27SECRET LEVEL FOUND
^c00
You have found the forest's secret level (although the level is not a forest). This one is based on the level E1L2. Here, instead of a time limit, you'll have to run for your life, as it will decrease in one point on each 2 seconds. The level has a main way to its end elevator, but you should check out the "useless" rooms, if you want to survive.
