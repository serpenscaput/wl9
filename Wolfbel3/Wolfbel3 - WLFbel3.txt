WLFbel3.txt file (updated version August 18, 2000).


WLFbel3.ZIP - by Brian E. Lowe, and Bill Hough (who made the first 14 levels).  Thanks 
also to Thomas Hubert who made one level (episode 5, level 5). 

This set now contains 57 new levels for the full 60 level registered set of Wolfenstein 
3D (PC and Acorn/Archimedes versions). The remaining 3 levels are from my first WolfBel 
set, but have been modified (extra guards/secret rooms etc). The 3 modified levels 
are from episode 6, levels 7, 8 and secret.

Since the original release, a few minor bugs (such as a blocked passage on episode 
1 level 8 - PC only) have been removed. Also, I have added the batch file WCheat. 
 PC users who want to enable these codes should start the game with this file.

WLFbel3.ZIP contains 4 files GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6, WCheat.BAT, plus this 
text file WLFbel3.txt.

Users may freely distribute these 4 files (or the ZIP file),  on a non-profit basis. 
 However, please do not distribute them (or the ZIP file), with any other files. 
 Users must have the original Wolf3D 60 level set to play this set.

These levels should be played with the original VSWAP.WL6 file.  Acorn/Archimedes 
users can get this from my first WolfBel set.
I didn't alter any of the objects/walls etc.  I find one of the reasons why the game 
is so compelling is the atmosphere of the Nazi era.  (Now that it's gone, that is. 
 It obviously wasn't very nice at the time).   
 
Acorn/Archimedes users may be aware of bugs in some previous add-on level sets.  
Passages which get blocked off - walls which disappear.  Sometimes a level wouldn't 
play at all.  All these levels have been tested on an Acorn 3010 computer and play 
OK. There are a couple of levels  where a wall looks out of place because it's gray 
stone and shouldn't be - episode 5 level 8 is one - but every level does work.
