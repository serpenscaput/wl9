<CENTER><FONT size=5><B><U><FONT color=crimson>The Nightmare 
Continues!!</TEXT></FONT></B></U><BR><BR><FONT size=3>Greetings! Welcome to the 
homepage for "HOS: Special Edition", the official add-on for "Wolfenstein: Halls 
of Stonehenge". Originally announced as "HOS: Dead Reckoning", the name and 
concept changed slightly after initial development, but the result is pretty 
much the same. This is just a single page rather than a full blown site, 
because, being that this is an add-on, much of what you'll find in the game is 
the same as in HOS. <BR><BR>BJ is thrown back in action against the forces of 
evil as Sarron's minions and fanatical followers struggle to destroy BJ and 
reclaim the power of Sarron. BJ will battle some familiar foes, as well as a 
host of new, gruesome minions, in an effort to save his own skin, and bring some 
peace and quiet back to the world. The full story will be included with the 
add-on when it comes out... <BR><BR>The weapons and basic gameplay in "Dead 
Reckoning" are pretty much the same as in "Halls of Stonehenge", but there are 
21 new levels, and a much different cast from the first game. The game was 
designed by members of the same team that brought you "Halls of Stonehenge", so 
hopefully you'll find it every bit as exciting, and hopefully, much more 
challenging! <BR><BR>I won't be putting any updates regarding this project on 
this page, since the project is finished already. If you have any questions or 
comments regarding the project in the mean time, you can email me at <FONT 
color=lightgreen>dhw_majik_monkee@yahoo.com</FONT>, and I'll try to answer any 
questions you may have regarding the game. <BR><BR>Below are some pictures of 
the cast in "Special Edition". Enjoy! Please do not steal these images. Image 
stealers go to the lowest depths of Hades, where they are roasted alive and 
forever tormented by Pauley Shore look-alikes, so don't do it! If it gets to be 
a problem, I'll pull the images, and then this site will suck! That having been 
said, enjoy your stay, and thanks for visitng! </CENTER><BR><BR><FONT 
size=5><B><U><FONT color=crimson>The New Cast</TEXT></FONT></B></U><BR><BR><FONT 
size=3><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRgiantrat.gif" align=center><BR><B><FONT 
color=fuchsia>GIANT RAT:</B></FONT> If you hate ordinary rats, then these could 
very well be your worst nightmare. They are fast and sneaky, and in large 
groups, can be deadly. Not too much of a problem individually. You're best off 
using hand to hand methods to dispatch them, since they don't leave any ammo. 
<BR><BR><BR><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRfanatic.gif" 
align=center><BR><B><FONT color=fuchsia>NAZI FANATIC:</B></FONT> These are the 
same brand of Nazi that inhabited the catacombs of Stonehenge. As before, they 
are not too intelligent or powerful, but if they manage to sneak up on you, you 
could be in trouble. A couple shots should dispose of them. They will leave 
behind ammo clips when defeated. <BR><BR><BR><IMG 
src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRextremist.gif" align=center><BR><B><FONT 
color=fuchsia>NAZI EXTREMIST:</B></FONT> These guys are very similar to the 
fanatics, but more devoted. To make matters worse, they are much quicker, more 
durable, and carry tommy guns instead of shotguns. The good news for you is that 
you get to keep the tommy gun if you beat them. Beware of battling them in 
groups. <BR><BR><BR><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRbat.gif" 
align=center><BR><B><FONT color=fuchsia>VAMPIRE BAT:</B></FONT> These creatures 
inhabit a wide variety of environments, and like to get in your face when you're 
not expecting it. They are surprisingly tough for bats, and it can take more 
than a couple shots to bring them down. They can attack with deadly sonar beams 
from a distance. Aim carefully, because they like to dodge and make you waste 
your bullets. <BR><BR><BR><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRgargoyle.gif" 
align=center><BR><B><FONT color=fuchsia>GARGOYLE:</B></FONT> Sarron's most 
trusted servants, the gargoyles served as the silent and deadly guardians of his 
lair in Stonehenge. They can sneak up on you and deliver a surprise attack that 
can often prove fatal, especially if you're already weakened. They'll leave 
behind ammo when destroyed, if you live to do so. <BR><BR><BR><IMG 
src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRwraith.gif" align=center><BR><B><FONT 
color=fuchsia>WRAITH:</B></FONT> After Sarron was destroyed, many of his most 
devoted followers lost all hope, and wasted away to these ghost-like forms. They 
now exist to endlessly torment BJ, and drain the life from him. Shooting them 
will make them go away, but it's only a temporary solution, as they will soon 
reappear. <BR><BR><BR><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRzealot.gif" 
align=center><BR><B><FONT color=fuchsia>ZEALOT:</B></FONT> This guy belongs to 
the highest order of Nazi fanatics. He is totally fearless, and will battle to 
the death to avenge Sarron's destruction. Not only does he carry a devestating 
riot gun, but he wears body armor that makes him hard to destroy. The good news 
is that if you manage to defeat him, his key is yours.<BR><BR><BR><IMG 
src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRstoneg.gif" align=center><BR><B><FONT 
color=fuchsia>STONE GARGOYLE:</B></FONT> If you thought gargoyles were a pain, 
these creatures will help reaffirm that belief. Not only are they faster and 
more agressive than standard gargoyles, but they are unbelieveably durable, and 
will light up your world with powerful energy blasts. They can't resist growling 
a warning at you before they start tearing you apart, so at least you can hear 
them coming. Luckily, they are far less common than other forms of gargoyle. 
<BR><BR><BR><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRstalker.gif" 
align=center><BR><B><FONT color=fuchsia>STALKER:</B></FONT> It's hard to find 
enough bad things to say about the stalker. They attack silently, and move in at 
high speed for the kill. It will take a fair amount of punishment to destroy 
them, which is easier said than done once they begin their relentless assault. 
Not as powerful as some enemies, but you won't want to mess with them. Once you 
meet one, don't lose track of it, or you might not live to regret it. 
<BR><BR><BR><IMG src="enemiesHOSDR_files/DRwerebeast.gif" 
align=center><BR><B><FONT color=fuchsia>WEREBEAST:</B></FONT> The werebeast is 
the worst of an already bad lot. Said to be human followers of Sarron, given the 
power to transform, nobody has ever survived a werebeast long enough to confirm 
this. They are extremely powerful, and can level you with devestating blasts of 
fire spewed from their jaws. Unfortunately, they carry keys you will need to 
progress, meaning you can't just avoid them.<BR><BR><BR><IMG 
src="enemiesHOSDR_files/it.bmp" align=center><BR><B><FONT 
color=fuchsia>"DEATH":</B></FONT> Sarron's chief lieutenant, Death is determined 
to destroy BJ, in order to harness the power of Sarron he absorbed, enabling him 
to open the gate back to Sarron's dimension. Death can take on many forms, but 
you are sure to recognize him when you confront him. Beware of the powerful 
bolts of energy he fires at you. Only by defeating Death can BJ end the 
nightmare of Stonehenge and put the followers of Sarron to rest once and for 
all.<BR><BR>
