^C25 CHAPTER 2: Stalking the STALKER!

^C00 With the death screams of the stone gargoyle still ringing in his ears, BJ descended 
deeper into the ruins of Stonehenge.  It seemed like yesterday that he was plunged 
into the madness of Sarron's twisted plot.  The Nazi fanatics had done wonders in 
rebuilding their lair in BJ's absence, but now it was his turn to do a little house 
cleaning.

^P

^C00 - GOOD LUCK, BJ!!
