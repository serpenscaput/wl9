<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">What you have before you is another 21-level set

in the HoS environment.&nbsp; While there are similarities between HoS and
HoS:SE, we think that you will still love the experience.&nbsp; There are a few
new sprites, a new weapon, many new guards and 21 new maps... all for your
pitchforkin' pleasure.&nbsp; There are some subtle differences in the coding
(mostly noticeable in the weapon strength), but this should enhance more than
distract.<br>
The levels were designed with the original levels in mind.&nbsp; While you will
see some similarities, the design and game play vary from the original
levels.&nbsp; Overall this set may be more difficult, but if you have some
savvy, then you will survive even on the harder skills levels.&nbsp; Aesthetics
were a large part of the design and exploration is sometimes the key.&nbsp; If
you don't get 100% ratios, you may be missing out on something good&nbsp; ;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>THE STORY:<br>
</b><br>
</font><font size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">It was starting again...</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">BJ Blazkowicz had already saved the world from
the evils of the other worldly creature, Sarron, and his gruesome minions. He'd
plunged into the ghoul infested realm beneath the ruins of Stonehenge, destroyed

the Nazi fanatics and monsters guarding it's passages, and put an end to the
operation's leader, Draven. The final battle with Sarron had almost cost him his

life, but BJ's luck never seemed to run out, and he had won the fight and made
it out of there in one piece. He deserved a break...or so he thought.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">BJ had just returned to the United States after
his vacation in England, and was trying to return to normal life. He was also
awaiting the arrival of the &quot;Ancient Sword of Evil&quot;, which he'd
shipped to the US military while still in England, eager to see it safely locked

away. Blazkowicz had waited for weeks for it's arrival, but it never came, and
he was pretty sure he knew what had happened to it. The sword had been the cause

of all the trouble in the first place, and it's disappearance meant nothing
short of disaster if it had fallen into the wrong hands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">BJ phoned Professor Von Reinstein, in England,
the man who had alerted him to the original Stonehenge crisis. Von Reinstein was

shocked to find the sword had disappeared, and immediately began to investigate
the situation. Days later, he phoned BJ with the news both of them had been
dreading: something was happening again at Stonehenge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Professor had done some snooping around the
ruins, as well as the surrounding settlements. Reports had begun to circulate of

unnatural creatures invading the area. So far, there had been some residents
reported missing, but none of them had turned up later as zombies. Whatever evil

was at work, it didn't seem to be using humans the way Sarron had been...yet.
This was only small comfort. Something evil was at work, and it needed to be
stopped before it went beyond simply kidnapping the locals and terrorizing the
surrounding countryside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">BJ wasn't crazy about the idea of returning to
Stonehenge, but he was even less thrilled about the possibility of a new reign
of supernatural terror. Sometimes he felt like part of his sanity had been lost
as a result of the last horrific supernatural battle, but it was the price that
needed to be paid. It was time to pay it again. Without thinking twice, BJ
grabbed the shotgun he'd used during his first excursion into Stonehenge, and
the pitchfork he'd kept as well (he considered it a lucky omen after the first
Stonehenge battle). It was time to do what had to be done...and there was no
turning back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Deep in the catacombs of the newly formed
Stonehenge realm, the fanatical followers of Sarron were busily making
preparations for the destruction of BJ, and the return of their evil master.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">When Blazkowicz had destroyed Sarron, their
otherworldly master's power had been transferred to the one who destroyed him.
BJ wasn't aware he'd inherited this power, and lying dormant within him, it
would soon fade away forever...and Sarron's essence would die with it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Desperate to bring Sarron back before it was too

late, the former Nazi fanatics had recaptured the sword before it could make it
to the United States, and returned it to the Stonehenge ruins. There, using the
same methods that had been used before, the fanatics openned a new realm beneath

the ruins, and through it, a new portal to the &quot;other side&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The fanatics were greeted by Sarron's chief
lieutenant, who called himself &quot;Death&quot;. Like the fanatics, Death was
eager to revive his master, and agreed to lend what minions he could to the
effort. However, the forces of the &quot;other side&quot; had been severely
depleted during BJ's last invasion, and another source of &quot;servants&quot;
would need to be found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Using his considerable powers, Death transformed

hordes of ordinarily harmless vermin into monstrous minions under his control.
He then lent all but a few of his followers from the &quot;other side&quot; to
service of the fanatics to guard the new Stonehenge realm. Death had sensed that

the man who had slain Sarron would soon be returning to once again do battle
with the Nazis...but this was good...this what what Death wanted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Only through BJ's destruction could the power of

Sarron be released, and it had to be done soon. Death was powerful, but he was
only a servant of Sarron, and not fit to rule the &quot;other side&quot;. If BJ
succeeded in destroying the minions of Stonehenge and reclaiming the Ancient
Sword of Evil, Sarron might never return. The &quot;other side&quot; would fall
into ruin, and the plot of the Nazi's to use the evil sword would fail forever.
Death was not going to let this happen. BJ Blazkowicz would die, either by his
hands, or the hands of one of his many minions. Then, Sarron would return, and
the world of man would fall into ruin once and for all...</font></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>KNOWN BUGS:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">1.) The par time bonus doesn't work when you
warp (but you shouldn't be cheating anyway!)<br>
2.) The two special weapons (the voodoo doll and the heart of darkness) create
small problems.&nbsp; On occasion you may not be able to pick up one of the
special weapons if you have 15 rounds of ammo of the other special weapon.&nbsp;

For example, if you have the voodoo doll and 15 rounds of ammo, you may not be
able to pick up the heart of darkness (or vice versa).&nbsp; It appears that if
you shoot off one round of the fully loaded special weapon that you will then be

able to pick up the other special weapon.&nbsp; A minor inconvenience at best.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>CHEATS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Unlike the original, HoS:SE has the standard
cheats enabled.&nbsp; SE used the same command lines and properties of SoD.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>STRATEGY GUIDE:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">1.) AIM!!!<br>
2.) If #1 fails.... RUN!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Seriously, though.&nbsp; It is a VERY good idea
to save your game at the end of each level.&nbsp; It is also a good idea to save

in multiple slots.&nbsp; SE contains a few levels with multiple secrets that can

be messed up, if one isn't careful.&nbsp; The secret elevators are somewhat hard

to access (yup - ya gotta earn the right to play them).&nbsp; If you are a
goober or if you get stuck, you can always open the gamemaps file in your
favourite editor and look around.&nbsp; If all else fails, you can either check
out the hints section (aka spoiler guide) or cheat.&nbsp; While sections of SE
are difficult, there should be adequate health and ammo on each level (most of
which isn't hidden) to keep you alive.&nbsp; However, if you can finish the
levels on IADI setting WITHOUT saving, then you have earned my respect&nbsp; ;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>SPOILER GUIDE:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #4:<br>
A very straightforward level, aside from accessing the secret elevator.&nbsp; If

you are adventurous, you will eventually come across a set of secret walls
marked with two mushrooms.&nbsp; The wall by the mushrooms is three blocks in
length.&nbsp; Push IN the two blocks marked with the mushrooms and then push the

centre block either to the left or right.&nbsp; Make sure to tell the bats that
I said hello&nbsp; ;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #19:<br>
I love run 'n' gun levels, so how could I not include a run 'n' pitchfork
level?&nbsp; You start the level by being warped into the centre of a graveyard
(infested with 149 rats).&nbsp; There is no ammo available unless you get the
keys (and even then, you need one particular key before the other).&nbsp; This
level is extremely rough on IADI, but is beatable without cheating.&nbsp; The
best strategy is to run and pitchfork as many rats as you can until you get the
first key needed (which is DIRECTLY to the right of your starting
position.&nbsp; Should you not be able to get to the key, you may be forced to
use up some ammo or find a little hiding spot from where you can pick off the
rats with your pitchfork.&nbsp; It is a good idea to watch your score (149 rats
= 29800 points).&nbsp; When your score has gone up 29800, then it is safe to
come out from your hiding spot.<br>
Each of the special weapons is hidden in this level.&nbsp; The locations are
marked with crystal balls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #10:<br>
A pretty easy boss level... if you are careful.&nbsp; It is best to let the
Stalker out of his lair so as not to activate all the fanatics nearby.&nbsp; Try

searching for secrets BEFORE you activate the Stalker.&nbsp; This level really
needs to be explored to be enjoyed... but be warned... those fanatics value
their treasure and will fight to the death to protect it from falling into your
greedy little hands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #12:<br>
One of my all time favourite levels... and it is a killer!&nbsp; Just so ya
know&nbsp; :)&nbsp; You do not need either key to finish the level, but you do
need both to access the secret elevator.&nbsp; Each key is in a mini-maze of
secrets that can be botched if one isn't careful.&nbsp; The first key is in the
main room.&nbsp; Look at the following graphic:</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img border="0" src="12a.gif" width="301" height="255"></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Start by pushing the bottom two blocks to the
left and right (as indicated by the 'L' and 'R').&nbsp; Then push in the two
blocks labeled 'I' and then push over the centre block.&nbsp; You now have the
first key.<br>
The second key can be found near the barrel maze, just before the end of the
level.&nbsp; Look at the following graphic:</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img border="0" src="12b.gif" width="270" height="303"></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You will enter the barrel maze in the southwest
corner.&nbsp; Proceed up to the northwest corner to find the first push
wall.&nbsp; Don't push #4 first, otherwise you will block the path to the
key.&nbsp; It doesn't matter which direction that you push the blocks, just as
long as you do them in order.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #20:<br>
Yup, you guessed it... if it's a secret level then it must be a run 'n' gun
level.&nbsp; You start off facing 75 gargoyles (the map originally had bats, but

they were just too hard to see... nasty!).&nbsp; There is some health kicking
around, but aiming and playing smart is the name of the game.&nbsp; The wooden
crossbeams will get in your way, but you should be able to pick off a few of the

gargoyles as you move along.&nbsp; If you watch the walls as you go by, you
should see that I designed it so that you have a path leading to the centre
section containing the keys and a few bonus items.&nbsp; I assume no
responsibility for what happens after that - lol.&nbsp; Again, it is a good idea

to watch your score to know when you have eliminated all the gargoyles (52500
points).</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #16:<br>
Yeah, sure... there are four extra lives near the lair of the boss, but you have

to fight through gargoyles and spiked poles to get to them... unless you are
adventurous.&nbsp; Since the gargoyles get released when you first fight the
boss, it is a good idea to get rid of them before... if you can.&nbsp; When you
first start the level, you will not see any guards for a while.&nbsp; When you
finally do get to the first spot containing guards, there are a series of
secrets on the left hand side of the room.&nbsp; If you make your way through
that area, you will come into the left hand side of the gargoyle rooms.&nbsp;
Now you should be able to blast them and with any luck, some will come across
the main room and open the door for you... enabling you to get the extra
lives.&nbsp; Once you activate the boss, you may want to scoot back to where you

first activated all these secrets and back track to the gargoyle rooms.&nbsp;
That way you can grab one of the extra lives without fighting some of those
nasty poles (and you can try to pick off the werebeast through the poles).</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level #18:<br>
Ah... those damaging spikes are the same colour as the
walls/floors/ceilings!&nbsp; Dang!!!&nbsp; The first section of this level is
designed using diagonals.&nbsp; Once you get a feel for this section, you should

be able to proceed with little difficulty (aside from all the gargoyles).&nbsp;
Remember... move diagonally before trying to cross over into the next diagonal
section.&nbsp; You'll see what I mean&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; There are numerous extra
lives in this level, none of which are hard to find.&nbsp; However, clearing the

path to get to the four of them near the end of the level is another
story.&nbsp; Once you enter the room containing the gold key, more gargoyles
will stream out of a room directly behind you (that is the room that contains
the four extra lives).&nbsp; There is a secret wall that allows you to get into
that room to get the four extra lives (unless you have the key and don't need to

access the secret), but you can only access that secret by alerting the
gargoyles within.<br>
When you get to the end, you will see three spikes and four walls.&nbsp; These
walls are push walls and how they move is painfully obvious.&nbsp; Beyond this,
you will see two gargoyles perched on opposite sides of the gold key door.&nbsp;

Behind each of these gargoyles is a secret.&nbsp; One leads to the special
weapons and the other leads to an extra life and creates a short path to the
room containing the four extra lives mentioned previously.&nbsp; The rest is up
to you&nbsp; ;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Level 21:<br>
Hehehehe.<br>
There are nine secrets in this level, of which eight are mandatory.&nbsp; Behind

each boss is a push wall.&nbsp; They all push in and can't be messed up.&nbsp;
Once you have all four walls pushed in, you can proceed through the four
gargoyle section.&nbsp; At the end of each section is a small room containing
1-3 gargoyles.&nbsp; Push in the centre block and that gets you into the next
section.&nbsp; After you have proceeded though all four sections, you will get
the last key.&nbsp; The ninth push wall is in that area and will get you back to

the silver key door (saves you running all the way back through the gargoyle
sections).&nbsp; Now the only thing separating you from success is Death....
good luck!</font></p>
