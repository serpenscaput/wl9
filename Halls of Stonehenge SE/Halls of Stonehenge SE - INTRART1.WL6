^C25 CHAPTER 1: REALM OF THE STONE GARGOYLE!

^C00 BJ walked through the mist permeating the ruins of Stonehenge.  As he stopped 
at the entrance of the catacombs, BJ could just make out the unholy sounds coming 
from beneath the earth.  Kicking aside a rat, BJ loaded two shells into his shotgun 
and felt himself smile for the first time in weeks.  This time the job would be finished. 
 This time it is personal!

^C00 - GOOD LUCK, BJ!!
