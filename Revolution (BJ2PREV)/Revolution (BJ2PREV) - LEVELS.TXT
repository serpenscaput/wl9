                WARNING --- WARNING --- WARNING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a PREVIEW version of this "The Revolution", a soon-to-be-released
60-level set of missions for the original iD Software hit, Wolfenstein 3-D.
This preview contains the first 6 levels of episode 1. You WILL be able to
complete the episode on level 6. 

This is a TEST version of these levels. This is NOT a complete set
and should NOT be distributed on any BBS's or networks or anything else.
In fact, unless you are Wayne Sikes, you shouldn't have these at all! <g>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     For those of you who really enjoyed playing the 60
action-packed floors contained in my first epic,
Wolfenstein's Renovation, get ready for a second helping:
Wolfenstein's Revolution. The last episode you experienced
contained a variety of themes, ranging from the investigation
of a new mutation hospital, to plundering the weapons horde
from a run-down insane asylum. All the while, our friend and
hero B.J. Blazkowicz was busy toasting crowd after crowd of
Nazis with seemingly endless salvos of lead. There was more
action in The Renovation's 60 floors than you could shake a
Remington FA 1200 chaingun at!
     Shortly after these missions were accomplished, and
B.J., proudly sporting some new medals, headed home, you as
the player ran out of things to do. All those great missions
were over now. Life literally became boring (okay, that's
pushing it, but hey, this is a promo, and promos are supposed
to blow stuff out of proportion). <g>
     But all the while I have been hard at work designing a
sequel to The Renovation, a sequel with just as much wild
action and suspense as the original sixty: Wolfenstein's
Revolution is coming, all you Nazi-blasting gamers, and you'll
soon once again be able to dive headfirst into 60 more blazing
levels of death and destruction. After all, that's my
specialty! So for now, I've bestowed upon you 6 levels of the
first episode as a "tide-me-over" (or "tide-you-over" to be
precise). I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making
them. And yes, iD Software, I did just rip off one of your
popular phrases. <g>

Title                   : OPERATION: SCHUTZSTAFFEL!

Description:

     Your first mission after returning to the hostile
country of communist East Germany is to find the Nazi
dungeon/prison which is also a hidden, extra-top-secret SS
training center, or the upper levels of it, anyway, headed
up by the stormtrooper extraordinare, Hans Grosse. The first
six floors of the complex are used as dungeons and torture
chambers. We've decided to give you a break, B.J., and only
have you wreak your brand of havoc on the first six floors.
That way, our troops can move in behind you and proceed right
to the SS training center without having to fiddle with the
opposition on the previous floors.
     But beware, B.J.! We have heard reports that the secret
elevator to the seventh floor, which our troops will need to
access after you finish your part of the mission, is guarded
by none other than Hans Grosse's brother, Dieter Grosse. You
are gonna have to take this guy out or we won't be able to
do our work on the 7th floor. Yes, I know, our troops are
wimps compared to you. What? No, I won't kiss your feet, Mr.
Blazkowicz! I'll have you know that I rank you and...well,
enough. You have your orders, now follow 'em!

******

William Joseph Blazkowicz III enters the Nazi compound as
directed by his superior. He manages to get inside the
dungeon, but a group of guards he hadn't counted on captured
him and threw him into a jail cell in the basement! And
that's where I leave you as the player -- in the jail cell.
Fortunately, I didn't leave you totally stranded -- you've
just killed your guard and taken his gun and keys. But the
guard stationed outside heard, and he's on his way when the
first screen of episode 1, level 1 fades onto your screen!
It's gonna be a long night!

Oh, and...good luck!
