1. What's here?

A repository of all documentation associated with games, mods and tools based on Wolfenstein 3D. This means anything distributed
with or in the game/tool - readmes, manuals, notes, *ART files, credits, even .bat files if they contain anything other than system
commands - without doing boneheaded things like ripping entire websites or extracting text strings from exe files.

I tried to cover every piece of software I could think of, but the ROTT section is woefully incomplete because I don't know anything
about ROTT tools or mods. To be corrected in the future, I guess.

Since many files contained long lines and so wouldn't wrap when displayed, they were batch modified to force a line break after 
every 60-80 characters. Hope they don't look ugly, but things seem fine at first glance.

2. What's not here?

Code. Ironic, I know. The only exception is when said code contains important documentation (which was often the case with old tools).
Also anything that isn't text. Absolutely no images or sounds. Only plain text documents (and sometimes .html files because they're 
passable, I guess). 

If something wasn't plain text, I made it so: copypasting from documents, extracting Windows help files, printing to 
file from executables. I was thinking about keeping .rtf files, but ultimately it's more trouble than it's worth. Office docs and pdfs
go right into the bin.

3. How to use this?

You can navigate by folder name, they currently should all fit on the screen. Text files relevant to commercial games are in Game 
Documentation, for editors etc. go to Tools. A few modders and series also have their own folders because otherwise github would 
truncate the list if I didn't make it shorter: jpb, Richter, TriplaK, OMJ, Mutantstein, Team Aardwolf Mapset, Super Haven Mapset, 
Final Fight, Mr. Wolf, Mapset, Romanstein, Enigma's Nightmare. Could still use some more.

You can click on Find file and start typing and anything you want will come up. Very useful, although some mods (say, Absence) 
have enough files that they simply won't all fit. Maybe I should merge them. You can always open a file then navigate to its 
folder immediately, so no big loss here.

Or you can type something in the upper left corner to perform a full text search of the entire repository. Say, "Apogee" brings up over
500 hits. Adding more words will narrow the results, for example typing "Apogee Mapedit" will only bring up documents that contain 
both words. I think.

4. Why wl9?

Because it's an expansion of wl6.

5. How much time did this take?

Shut up.

6. Anything left to do? Need help?

Yes, please. As noted above, ROTT needs a lot of coverage. I'm also looking for any possible missing mod or tool versions, for 
example, I can no longer find the downloads for most Vincent tools versions or old WDC releases. Also couldn't get *ART files 
for a few mods because I don't know how to extract them from the data files. And Chokage has stuff locked with passwords that 
I couldn't get my hands on.

7. This is useless.

I know.
