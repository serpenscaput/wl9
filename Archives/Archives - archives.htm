<p><font face="Georgia">Archives - Volume I</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Greetings (and prepare to be schooled... you have been
warned).</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">For those of you who know me, you are already familiar
with my archives.&nbsp; For those of you who aren't, I will give you a little
preamble.&nbsp; Over the past decade, I have made a lot more maps than I have
ever released.&nbsp; Some were experimental in nature, others not good enough to

use yet still good enough to use later on as a basis for another level, some
were too advanced or too hard for the average player, and others were quite
decent although never quite fit in with the sets on which I have worked on as of

late.&nbsp; I have designed more maps than I care to admit, and I have pulled
some of the more cerebral ones to make this set.&nbsp; You have been warned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Georgia">Cerebral, eh?&nbsp; Yeah... cerebral.&nbsp; Over the
years I have learned a trick or two and many of which are evidenced in this
set.&nbsp; I tried to use floor coding, object/wall placement and guard AI
against the player in many situations.&nbsp; Yes, this set is hard if playing on

the higher skills.&nbsp; You have been warned.&nbsp; Being in the wrong place at

the wrong time, alerting the wrong guards, allowing certain guards to move
about... all can have consequences that are dangerous to your health.&nbsp; At
times the little things that cause variance in the game play are extremely
evident and other times they are rather sublime.&nbsp; So be it.&nbsp; Should
you only make attempt at this set, much of this will not be evident, so perhaps
my mentioning this is a moot point, but I would be remiss if I didn't say
something.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">In the real world, would you be stupid enough to enter
through a door that may lock behind you if you didn't already have the
key?&nbsp; Don't make that mistake here.&nbsp; Also, I should warn you that it
is possible to block a couple of the secrets by killing an enemy right next to
the path that the secret wall will take.&nbsp; There are not many instances
where this is possible and most respects it is almost impossible or improbable
to do.&nbsp; Still, it can happen.&nbsp; Saving is a must and saving in multiple

slots is a bright thing to do.&nbsp; You have been warned.&nbsp; This is
especially imperative when going for perfect games.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">There should be ample ammo and health in open areas to
get you through the game.&nbsp; For the average player, you should be able to
play on the medium skill levels and have enough supplies to get through the game

with a minimum of saving.&nbsp; There are stashes of ammo and health hidden in
secret areas, but consider these a top up, if you will.&nbsp; Also, you will
find a reasonable amount of treasure out in the open.&nbsp; I can't stomach
games that force the players to look for secrets to survive.&nbsp; That is just
sooooo bush league.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Secret areas should be sought out.&nbsp; You will find
your fair share of basic secrets that merely contain supplies or treasure.&nbsp;

Some are aesthetically pleasing too.&nbsp; But, if you know me, you will soon
realize that finding secrets will either lead you to some great areas that will
not only help your score, but help you beat those bloody Nazis in the
process.&nbsp; Yes, with floor coding and guard positioning, you just might find

that the odd secret will make a hard area much easier.&nbsp; You have been told.</font></p>

<p><font face="Georgia">I hate sets that merely play out in front of the
player.&nbsp; Those are the norm and I have grown very weary of that form of
one-dimensional gameplay.&nbsp; In this set there are ambushes, guards coming at

you from more than one angle at a time, interesting uses of open and closed
areas, and the like.&nbsp; Expect anything.&nbsp; You may hear a guard cry out
an alert, but never see him.&nbsp; Hear those doors opening and closing in the
distance?&nbsp; It happens for a reason.&nbsp; You have been warned.&nbsp;
Speaking of open areas, please remember it is not my fault if you kill too many
guards in one area thus causing that visual bug where objects appear/disappear
on your screen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">I broke some rules - sue me!&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Any rule I

broke was for the greater good of the level or the set as a whole.&nbsp; You may

find some things that you truly don't like about the gameplay.&nbsp; Since I
cannot satisfy everyone (and I wasn't going to try to satisfy just you, gentle
reader), I tried to satisfy no one.&nbsp; Instead I strove to make a set of
which I could be proud.&nbsp; Do I expect you to agree with my standards?&nbsp;
Of course not.&nbsp; Those of you that need coding, audio, or graphic
enhancements will be sorely annoyed by this mapset.&nbsp; The cure?&nbsp; Don't
play it.&nbsp; Delete it now.&nbsp; I know that there is still a core of
hardened Wolfers out there that appreciate the original game in its original
form.&nbsp; Much like acktung!, that is what this set is... the original game
with my own personal spin added to the gameplay.&nbsp; If you don't like it,
that is fine by me, but please don't criticize our passion for the original
game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Speaking of deviation against the norm, mutants have
been introduced early and officers are introduced much later.&nbsp; This does
cause some pain in the early levels, but in all honesty, seeing mutants in the
slime areas makes more sense to me.&nbsp; Since the slime areas are the dungeons

beneath the castle... well, you figure it out - lol.&nbsp; I used the
Wolfenstein format for the intro elevators.&nbsp; In other words, you cannot
enter the elevator at the beginning of the level.&nbsp; Shouldn't be a major
issue.&nbsp; Par times and ceiling colours are factory set - i.e. there have
been no changes.&nbsp; That too takes away from the feel of the game, in my
not-so-humble opinion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Oh... right... par times.&nbsp; Let's talk about
those.&nbsp; In selecting these levels, I made sure that the original par times
could be beat.&nbsp; Some levels even have subtle little ways to get a nice
bonus if you beat the par time.&nbsp; I will not be offering any suggestions in
that regard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Is it just me, or is this getting way too freaking long?</font></p>

<p><font face="Georgia">And now, onto the obligatory crap contained in most
readmes:</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Installation:&nbsp; I have no idea and you are on your
own</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">In event of finding bugs:&nbsp; Repeat after me,
&quot;ack never told me to play this and I am on my own.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Thank you, thank you, thank you! goes to:<br>
- iD Software<br>
- anyone who worked on MapEdit, which was used to make the original maps<br>
- Adam Biser for WDC, which was used to compile this collection (and for being
an all-around good guy)<br>
- Ariel &amp; Wolfie3dfan for talking me out of making this a private release
(ya, I was only going to share this set with my friends)<br>
- Brian E. Lowe for his support of the community with his help, websites, and
advice to all<br>
- Steve and the Lady for being such great people and full of support<br>
- anyone else who is asking themselves, 'why the &lt;bleep&gt; didn't ack thank
me?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">This set can be posted anywhere.&nbsp; I don't
care.&nbsp; This file need not be attached.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; Use these
maps and claim them to be your own.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; Manipulate them
and use them in your own projects without giving me credit.&nbsp; I don't
care.&nbsp; Jimmy crack corn.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; The only thing I do care

about is that you get some enjoyment out of playing these maps.&nbsp; If you do,

then you have made my day.&nbsp; If you don't, well... what can I say?&nbsp; I
tried to make them fun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">The wanton rambling must cease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">G'night Gracie &amp; Goodnight Mrs. Calabash (wherever
you are)</font></p>
