A Doll's House v1.8.

Thank you for wanting to play A Doll's House.

The game is compiled for Spear of Destiny and comes with the following 9 files:
DH.EXE, AUDIOT, GAMEMAPS, MAPHEAD, VGADICT, VGAGRAPH, VGAHEAD, VSWAP and DH.TXT (this file).


A Doll's House uses some resources from the original Wolfenstein games.
To protect the copyright of the owner of the original game, the AUDIOHED file is not included in the zip.
You must own a registered version of Spear of Destiny to supply that file.

How to install and run A Doll's House:
Create a new directory or folder.
Unzip DH.ZIP in this directory/folder.
Copy the AUDIOHED file from your original Spear of Destiny directory/folder.
Start DH.EXE

Before you start beware the following:
A water puddle will take all ordinary ammo from you unless your health is 20% or lower, in which case it will add 3 to your health.
Be also aware that you can carry only one cross at a time.

The author of A Doll's House kindly requests people not to modify A Doll's House nor use part of it in other add-ons.
