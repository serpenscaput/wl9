____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


      * MISSION BRIEFING * 

Location:      
    Secret Catacombs that house the Grand Lodge of the Order of the Magi of the Radiant 
Star. 
Date:         
  3rd of June 1937

Brother Mueller I have something most serious to ask of you on behalf of our Order, 
as a friend I would ask you not to go.. 
for it is gravely dangerous, but I also know how important it is for the resistance.

And I know you are the best agent for the mission.

My Brother we need you to sneak into the Castle of DOSenstein. 
We need you to investigate rumors that a newly formed division of the SS has refortified 
the Castle...
..And began working rites of dark magick, with powerful ancient relics.  
Our intelligence gathering points to the Knights of the SS a new exclusive order 
of elite SS officers, who are forging an Arayan warrior nobility of the Third Reich. 

 SchutzStaffel der Ritter Schwarze Sonne ...   They are said to venerate the Black 
Sun.
We have heard rumors..
That Knights of the SS leading Ahnenerbe recently recovered the mythical hero Beowulf's 
Armor and Sword Hrunting.

Our members in Allied Military and Intelligence report that an Allied spy BJ who 
escaped from Castle Wolfenstein, has been dispatched to recover the Spear of Destiny. 

We have also heard from connections in the French Resistance that the SS is now searching 
for the Holy Grail.
They have raided a catacomb under the Notre Dame Cathedral after translating some 
stolen documents from another order.  
They have also been said to be excavating Old Norse Runes. 

As a Magi and a Knight of the Silver Cross you know that we must investigate these 
claims and if they prove true..,
That we must stop them. 
If you choose to accept this mission we will use your code name Falcon 93 in all 
correspondence to protect your identity. 

Brother Mueller we have witnessed the Nazi Party take over our country, the Wermacht 
has already swept across Europe,
and with the power of these talismans the Knights of the SS could become an unstoppable 
force of Fascism.
I fear we may never again see liberty, but surely the power of the mighty Horus is 
with you, you are our best agent Johannes,
And yet should you fall in the sacred battle for freedom I will always remember you 
as a friend, 
and your sacrifice will not be in vain, this Aeon shall some day shine with freedom, 
may our grandchildren see that day. 
 
Do what thou wilt my Brother. 
Agent Falcon 93 Do you accept this mission?

In the SOD TC Series ‘Knights of the SS’

The mysterious order Magi of the Radiant Star has been building secret resistance 
networks to fight against the Axis Regimes. Agent Falcon 93 sneaks into Castle DOSenstein 
to discover the truth about K-SS in the ‘Armour of Beowulf’. 
In other Episodes….
Brothers and Sisters of the Magi Order use guns, magick, and guerilla tactics in 
the fight against Fascism, from forests and groves, to the dark Castles of Wewelsburg 
and DOSenstein, all the way to subterranean caverns and catacombs, as they take on 
Special SS Knight Squads, battle the UnDead, and powerful SS Priests. 
Recovering great artifacts from the Nazi’s such as Beowulf’s Armour and Sword Hrunting, 
Old Norse Runes, and the Holy Grail. 


In the yet to be named Wolf3d TC…
6 Episodes of Special Operations and Intelligence Missions with Allied and Resistance 
Forces…

Including a Joint SS and Luftwaffe Bunker with advanced technology and bio-medical 
research labs where mad scientists are rumored to have created mutants & cyborgs, 
developed laser and plasmas weapons, and reverse engineered Extra-Terersestrial technology. 
 

More planned including a multi installment series of TC’s spanning Wolfenstein 3D, 
Spear Of Destiny, DooM, Heretic, and Hexen. This would involve porting Wolfenstein 
into those games.
Where the player uncovers a Nazi Portal and fights through Mars, Hell, and other 
dimensions. 

Including an Egyptian Episode using the DooM, Heretic, or Hexen engine, where the 
Magi fight along side Egyptian Mummies(allies) against Rommel’s Afrika Corps and 
the Knights of the SS.

* ABOUT *

**        Knights of the SS : Armour of Beowulf.         **
             Alpha Demo Featuring 
             Mission 3 Castle Court (demo level 1)
            and Elevator Lobby ([filler] demo level 2). 
================================================

This is a very rough Alpha Demo by Falcon 93 Studios. It is a modification of Spear 
Of Destiny(TM - ID Software [see credits]).

The First level is actually mission 3 of an upcoming TC of SOD called Armour of Beowulf, 
from a planned series called Knights of the SS. 
The second level is just a filler, it is merely a small elevator lobby. 
The Demo version of Spear of Destiny has 2 levels. In the near future I will release 
an updated version with a full second level.
This may be done with engine I started to edit code for, it currently supports a 
lighting effect and atmosphere i.e. rain. 

Later Falcon 93 Studios will release a full length Spear of Destiny Total Conversion 
with source code changes, more audio & graphical changes, new enemies and weapons, 
and special features like reanimating corpses, treasure fueled manna as ammo for 
magickal weapons, and more.

This Alpha Demo runs on the Spear Of Destiny Demo version engine and game files, 
it does not use any source code changes, or any original graphics. 
It does however feature an original level designed by J Falcon, and several sprite 
& texture graphics developed by members of the Wolf3d/SOD Modding community(see Credits) 
and the order of music has been changed, with some music imported from Wolfenstein 
3D. 



* Alpha Demo V 1.0  Release Notes * And Trouble Shooting * 

This demo show cases as much as possible without reprogramming, and within the limits 
of the slimmed down SOD demo version,
 the general atmosphere of Armour of Beowulf from my planned series, The Knights 
of the SS. 

The TC’s I have planned will feature much more extensive redesigning. 

In v 1.0 

The title screen is not satisfactory but it is suitable for an Alpha Demo. 
The pallet used by SOD for the title screen causes great difficulty. 
The issue is either that I could not get my image editors to work with the pallet, 

or the Wolf3d/SOD editors do not have the title screen pallet configured correctly, 

or something else is going on that I don’t understand yet. 
Suffice to say I simply had to guess which colors to use and then test how it looked 
after uploading the graphics. 

The enemies and static objects are maxed out, this may cause issues,
 but I have play tested it and I believe the common bugs are worked out. 

Run Castle Court (EXE) to play the game. 
It is a newer version of the Demo with some bugs patched.
I have also included a folder with the Patched Demo EXE and the Older Demo EXE. 


I suggest downloading VDM Sound and DOS Box. 
Without running through VDM Sound I have no music on my machine. 
Just download it(it is free), then right click Castle Court  (EXE) and select "Run 
with VDMS".

If you enjoyed this mod....
More will come in time....
Stay Tuned.


Also I have now 4 Farcry(TM - From Ubisoft) Instincts(#1) X-Box (original) Multiplayer 
Maps crafted. 
Panu Ro Island, ZEBEZ River, ZaKek Ro Pass, and TonaKu RO Temple, They are based 
on following from Island Coast, to a River through Mountains, to a grand water way 
avenue of Shrines, to a Great Temple. There are multiple pyramids throught the levels. 

I will find a way to make them available soon.
