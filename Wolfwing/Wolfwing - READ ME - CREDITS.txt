This is a mod from Tomas Weilings game: "Novowolf"

I do not take credit for coding, objects, walls, pallets, music or any other stuff 
made on WOLFWING
what actually was modified by me and first was NOVO. I only take credits on making 
the levels
and placing the objects. only lvl 6, lvl 7 and lvl 10 are from Tomas Weiling with 
some little edits.
the walls, pallets and objects are all copyrighted to Tomas Weiling and the other 
rightfull 
owners. Please if you read this also play NOVO by Tomas Weiling.
