^CFE AT LAST... SCHWARZENBORN CASTLE!

^C00 After Dr. Dittz joined hands with Hitler and all the others down in Hell, you 
found a truck in the labs' cargo area, and rode out in the misty night towards the 
foothills of the Harz. Walking through three miles of forest and thicket, you found 
the rusty gates and the entrance to this old castle.

Good luck to you again, BJ!
