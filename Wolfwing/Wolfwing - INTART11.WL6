^CFE APPROACHING THE LABS...

^C00 The end of Horst's map gave you an impression of what you'll face the next five 
maps. Yes, it'll be pools of waste, leaking nuclear barrels, crazy scientists and 
mad mutants all over. Good luck!

Oh yeah, it's also the place where you will face Dr. Dittz, on the 15th floor. But 
he is all lock, stock and barrel. All the labs date from the present, there's even 
parts in the upcoming floors that aren't even done yet, so watch out!
