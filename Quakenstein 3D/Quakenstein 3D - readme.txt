QuakenStein was created by me, Pete Jones. It is based on The Wolfenstein 3D engine, 
and you basically move around, shoot people, and find decent weapons. This is an 
FPS game and the object is to get out of the Castle by killing everything in your 
way.

PLEASE NOTE!

Episode 1 has 9 levels. The other episodes are not finished.
