OVERVIEW:  ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III is a complete set of alternate playing
levels and graphics for the SHAREWARE VERSION of ID Software's incredible
game of WOLFENSTEIN 3D. 

NM-III levels are very hard, with more treasure, more guards, more guns, MORE
ACTION than you've ever seen in WOLF 3D!  You'll need to be NASTY to get 
through these in one piece!  These are without a doubt some of the roughest,
toughest, most harrowing WOLFENSTEIN levels you'll EVER see!  It's almost an
"Impossible Mission"!  (Well, not really.  But it'll FEEL like it.)

The NIGHTMARE graphics are more colorful and much more bloody (shoot a guard
and he either goes down in a spray of gore or gets his head completely blown
away).  

So, throw out that original NIGHTMARE, pitch that copy of NIGHTMARE II, (AS
WELL AS THOSE OLD COPIES OF NIGHTMARE-III v.1 & v.2, IF YOU HAVE THEM....). 
Here it is!  The BEST, the BADDEST, (the FINAL) version of the ENIGMA'S
NIGHTMARE series, E-V-E-R!  Good luck!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III not only contains all new maps and play levels, but
it also includes all (corrected) maps and levels from the first, original
NIGHTMARE and NIGHTMARE II.  Now users can select whatever NIGHTMARE 
episode they wish to play from a simple, menu driven loader.

NIGHTMARE graphics may also be loaded or unloaded independently from the
actual games, via menu driven loader.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDITS:  I wish to thank both Ix and FRANK THE RABBIT for their kind help
and hard work in making ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III possible.

BY THE WAY.... This program (and all NIGHTMARE versions) are distributed
               for free.  They cost nothing.  Zero, zip, ziltch.  So if
               you were unfortunate enough to pay for this, frankly, you
               were screwed.  Demand your money back!

WHEN YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK, why not spend it on registering your shareware
version of WOLFENSTEIN?  You won't regret it!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES LIST: the NIGHTMARE III archive should be named the following: 
ENM3-V30 
If it's called anything else, I wouldn't trust it!  Best to search Internet
or various BBS until you find the original!

These are the files included in the original ENM3-V30 archive.
If any are missing, you have a defective copy:
                   
archive ENM3-V30 ------------------
INSTRUCT.TXT   NM33SND.EXE    NM33NSTL.EXE   READ-1ST.BAT   FILE_ID.DIZ 
NM33GRA.EXE    EN3FIXES.TXT   ENM3-V30.INT   READ-FIX.BAT

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNINGS:  All files in this archive (and the offspring files created upon
installation), are needed in order that NIGHTMARE III will work correctly. 
Don't delete files just because you cannot see how they fit into things.
They are NEEDED, believe me!   

BE CAREFUL and DO NOT try to re-archive these offspring files!  If you want
to upload or distribute NIGHTMARE III, do so in the original archive only.

Keep in mind that the installer will delete some files which are no longer
needed after NM-III is installed, in order to help you save disk space. 
Therefore, be sure to keep a backup of the original archives in case you need
to install again.

NOTE:  If you try to run NM-III with a commercial version of WOLF 3D, you'll
destroy both programs.  Run with SHAREWARE WOLFENSTEIN ONLY. (v. 1.4)

If you try to run the Sound Blaster supported version of the loader without
a Sound Blaster card installed, you'll screw the loader.

Lastly, DO NOT attempt to install or run NIGHTMARE III under Windows.  The
results may not be what you hoped for.  NIGHTMARE was created to run from the
DOS prompt because we HATE Windows!  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS:  If you can play WOLFENSTEIN 3D on your system, then
you can play the NIGHTMARE series.  If you can't play WOLF on your hardware,
then what are you messing with this for?

You need VGA (a VGA card with 1 meg of memory is best, especially if you run
the fancy graphical loader), and DOS 3.3 or above.  While a 286 is ok for
playing Wolfenstein, a 386 is even better and highly recommended.  We're not
sure how the loader will act on anything less than a 386.  NO MATTER WHAT 
YOU'RE RUNNING, ANSI.SYS MUST BE ENABLED IN YOUR CONFIGURATION FILE.  If 
you're unsure how to do this, see your DOS manual.

A Sound Blaster, while not a must, is VERY nice.  You should get one if you
don't have one already.  

You will most definitely need a hard drive for NIGHTMARE III.  All of its
files (plus the Wolfenstein files) will take up around 5 to 6 megabytes of
hard drive space.  No "fast fingered floppy flippers" need apply......

NIGHTMARE III was developed on a machine with 4 megs of memory.  That's not
to say less RAM makes the NIGHTMARE games unplayable, but the more memory you
have, the better.  Also, the faster your machine, the better the play (but
isn't that true of most game software)?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  Create a BRAND NEW, EMPTY directory (maybe call
it NM-III) and install a SHAREWARE version (version 1.4 ONLY) of WOLFENSTEIN
3D in it.  Run WOLF and set your game configurations any way you wish, then
exit.

Next, move the NIGHTMARE III archives into that directory and open them.

Now that You've unpacked the NIGHTMARE III archives in the same directory as
your SHAREWARE VERSION of WOLFENSTEIN 3D, the first thing you'll need to
do is run the file NM33NSTL.EXE.  This is a one time only procedure that
unpacks the NIGHTMARE III support files and gets them ready for loading into
the game.  Once again, ALL FILES INSTALLED BY NM33NSTL.EXE ARE NEEDED. 
DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THEM FROM YOUR DIRECTORY!!!!!

After this is done, simply run the file LOADNM33.EXE.  This file allows you
to load or unload NIGHTMARE III episodes or graphics into your shareware WOLF
game at will.  Follow the prompts and that's all there is to it!  HAVE FUN!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOADER PROBLEMS?:  We're going for a simple, more direct loader this time. 
Folks with lower-end equipment had trouble with the other two. 

To assist these people, we have designed a straight, menu driven loader that
will work with ANY system.  (Provided ANSI.SYS is enabled.)  Of course, you
can still select the fancy loader too if you wish.

ONCE AGAIN, IF THE LOADER DOESN'T WORK, BE SURE YOU HAVE ANSI.SYS LOADED.
YOUR DOS MANUAL WILL TELL YOU HOW........................................

If you use a Sound Blaster, BE SURE you have the CT-VOICE driver loaded, or
the loader will not work.  Refer to your SB manual to see how this is done.
It's easiest to set it up to load when you boot the machine.  If you run the
loader with Sound Blaster option enabled and you hear no voices or sound 
effects or get a driver failure error, then you do not have CT-COICE loaded
and will need to fix the situation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING:  The main problem with NIGHTMARE III (and with WOLF itself
for that matter), is memory considerations.  Make sure all TSRs are unloaded
to make room for the game.

This is because NM-III maps & levels are not packed the same way the original
maps are, and the NM-III maps are more complex with more guards than the WOLF
originals.

Again, because of map size and complexity, you may see odd screen effects,
colors and characters from time to time, (especially when saving a Wolf
game).  If these artifacts become too annoying, simply exit WOLF and reload
it and the problems should clear.  If not, exit WOLF, reboot and reload it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYING HINTS:  Most keys and some elevators are hidden.  There are some
levels in which you'll be rushed by gobs of dogs & guards.  When that
happens, it's a good idea to hunt for a secret way out before you get
yourself waxed.

You also may find walk-through walls (walls you can go through as if they
are not there).  These are screwups on our part because the maps are too
complex to be sure of fixing all bugs.  At times, guards fire at you with
no effect.  We're not sure why this happens.

While playing, SAVE THE GAME OFTEN.  If you get killed go back to the last
saved point.  If you are killed and allow the game to start you again at
the beginning of the level, keep in mind that WOLF keeps your previous
moves on that level in memory.  You'll probably run out of memory shortly
after you restart the level.

When you reload from a saved point however, all memory is freed and you can
go on playing with no memory problems.

ALSO, because NM-III maps are bigger, the WOLF game may freeze (very rarely)
when loading a NIGHTMARE level.  (That's why it's best to save the game
just before you enter an elevator to go to the next level).  Just reboot
and load it again.  Problems should clear instantly.

NEVER try to play a game you saved while in one episode while playing in
another, different episode.  You'll screw both NM-III and your shareware
Wolfenstein programs amd need to reinstall both to unsnarl things.

It's a good idea not to play with full sized screen window.  I always go to
the largest window, then step back two sizes.

Other than that, you're on your own!  :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRAM SUPPORT:  ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III (and all Nightmare versions) are
distributed throughout Internet and the BBS world by WOLFENSTEIN fans.
This means that any BBS banners or ads you see in the archive are merely
places the archive has been while on its way to wherever you got it.  

SO, if you're having problems, DO NOT call these BBSs or Internet sites
asking for help!!!  There is no support site for this program.  So don't
pester people about it.

If you can't get NIGHTMARE III to work, this means that:

1. You have a bad copy.
2. Your equipment won't support it.
3. NM-III may have conflicts with certain EMM or TSR programs.  Unload them.
4. You did not read these instructions and follow them.
5. We screwed up, so whack our weenies and call us jerks.
6. You are dumb!  Dumb as a post!  (And if this is the case, give up now.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTION:  This file is big enough without adding such bullshit as BBS
ads to 'em. This is a practice I DO NOT approve of.  I hope those BBS A-holes
Rusty-n-Edie's can read and understand this!!!  This program WAS NOT created
to promote your damned board!  So stop peeing in every archive you see.

By the way, the above goes for placing extra files inside the archives only.
This does not mean BBSs should not put a banner on the archive itself, that
constitutes fair use.  Be my guest!

There is certainly one way for users to keep down tranfer costs inflicted on
them by file-adding jerks such as those mentioned above:

If you find any files other than those mentioned in the FILES LIST section
when you open the NM3 archive, remove those extra files before you try to
distribute NM-III to other people, Internet or BBSs.  

Also, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT distribute this archive under a different
name, DO NOT pass around incomplete versions, and please distribute only the
ORIGINAL ARCHIVE which you know is in good working order!  DO NOT try to
break the archive into smaller files.  You'll most likely screw it up!

We had some user who, after reading this, proceeded to upload known flawed
copies of an earlier version to a bunch of ftp sites.  He wrote in the text
description that it was flawed "but still playable...." 

Well, DUH, guy!  If we'd wanted bad copies floating around, we'd have done
it ourselves.  (Matter of fact, we DID do it ourselves...considering this is
a bug fix version).  But anyway, WAKE UP!

Remember, this file is BIG and the next guy in line would like a working
copy after going to the trouble of downloading this program.  So once again,
distribute ONLY the original, intact, working archive!  Please spread NM3
around so many can enjoy it.  

Also, for those of you on Internet, please put ENM3-V30 up on every ftp site
you know of that accepts uploads.

PLEASE use the included text file ENM3-V30.INT as your internet description
text file.  Simply change its name to ENM3-V30.TXT for use on internet.

Blanket the world!

Thanks, and enjoy ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III version 3!
