ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE II DOCUMENTATION.

READ THIS THROUGH, OR DON'T BLAME ME IF THINGS GO HORRIBLY WRONG!  Contains
all the things you NEED to know to get full enjoyment from NIGHTMARE II!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW:  ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE II is a complete set of new playing levels and
graphics for the SHAREWARE VERSION of ID Software's incredible WOLFENSTEIN
3D. NM-II levels are very hard, with more treasure, more guards, more guns,
MORE  ACTION than you've ever seen in WOLF 3D!  The graphics are more color-
ful and much more bloody (shoot a guard and he either goes down in a spray of
gore or gets his head completely blown away).  

New wall patterns, new door patterns, new EVERYTHING!  ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE II
is created in eager anticipation of DOOM, the newest adventure from ID.  DOOM
is due in mid-1993 and NM-II was designed to hold avid WOLF fans until its
release.

You'll need to be NASTY to get through these in one piece!  These are some
of the roughest, toughest most harrowing WOLFENSTEIN levels you'll EVER see!
Good luck!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNINGS:  All files in this archive (and the offspring files created upon
installation), are needed in order that NIGHTMARE II will work correctly. 
Don't delete files just because you cannot see how they fit into things.
They are NEEDED, believe me!   

Keep in mind that the installer will delete some files which are no longer
needed after NM-II is installed, in order to help you save disk space. 
Therefore, be sure to keep a backup of the original archive in case you need
to install again.

BE CAREFUL and DO NOT try to re-archive these files!  If you want to upload
or distribute NIGHTMARE II, do so in the original ENITE-II archive only.

The file DEMO.EXE (which will be created during initial install), is NOT a
demo.  It is part of the loader so don't delete it, otherwise things will
not work.

Lastly if you do not have a Sound Blaster (any flavor) installed in your
machine, DON'T tell the loader you do have one!  It'll try to load certain
drivers your machine cannot support.  At the very least, you'll damage a lot
of files in your WOLF directory.  And things could get nastier if hardware
gets into the act.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES LIST:  These are the files included in the original ENITE-II archive. 
If any are missing, you have a defective copy:
                   
INSTRUCT.COM   NM2LDR.EXE     NM2SND.EXE   
NM2GRA.EXE     NM2INSTL.EXE   FILE_ID.DIZ

Also, the NIGHTMARE II archive should be named the following:  ENITE-II. 
If it's called anything else, I wouldn't trust it!  Best to search INTERNET
or various BBS until you find the original!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  Create a directory (maybe called NM-II) and
install a SHAREWARE version of WOLFENSTEIN 3D in it.  Move the ENITE-II
archive into that directory and open it.

Now that You've unpacked the NIGHTMARE II archive in the same directory as
your SHAREWARE VERSION of WOLFENSTEIN 3D, the first thing you'll need to
do is run the file NM2INSTL.EXE.  This is a one time only procedure that
unpacks the NIGHTMARE II support files and gets them ready for loading into
the game.  Once again, ALL FILES INSTALLED BY NM2INSTL.EXE ARE NEEDED. 
DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THEM FROM YOUR DIRECTORY!!!!!

After this is done, simply run the file LOADIT.EXE.  This file allows you to
load or unload NIGHTMARE II into your WOLF game at will.  Follow the prompts
and that's all there is to it!  HAVE FUN!

NOTE:  If you try to run NM-II with a commercial version of WOLF 3D, you'll
destroy both programs.  Run with SHAREWARE WOLFENSTEIN ONLY.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOADER PROBLEMS?  In the loader, there's a credit screen which requires
hitting the ESCAPE key to continue.  When you hit ESC, the options menu
should load.  Most of the time it loads with no problem (though it may take
a second or two).

However once in awhile the loader stalls at this point, leaving a flashing
cursor at the bottom of the screen.  When this happens, hit the ESC key 
once more and the menu should load ok.  Be sure to wait a few seconds to
be sure the loader is really hung before hitting ESC that second time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING:  The main problem with NIGHTMARE II (and with WOLF itself
for that matter), is memory considerations.  Make sure all TSRs are unloaded
to make room for the game.

While playing, SAVE THE GAME OFTEN.  If you get killed go back to the last
saved point.  If you are killed and allow the game to start you again at
the beginning of the level, keep in mind that WOLF keeps your previous
moves on that level in memory.  You'll probably run out of memory shortly
after you restart the level.

This is because NM-II maps & levels are not packed the same way the originals
are, and the NM-II maps are more complex with more guards than the originals.

HOWEVER, if you reload from a saved point, all memory is freed and you can
go on playing with no memory problems.

NIGHTMARE II was developed on a machine with 4 megs of memory.  That's not
to say less RAM makes the game unplayable, but the more memory you have, the
better.

ALSO, because NM-II maps are bigger, the WOLF game may freeze (very rarely)
when loading a NIGHTMARE level.  (That's why it's best to save the game
just before you enter an elevator to go to the next level).  Just reboot
and load it again.  Problems should clear instantly.

LASTLY, again, because of map size and complexity, you may see odd screen
effects, colors and characters from time to time.  If these become too
annoying, simply exit WOLF and reload it and the problems should clear.
If not, exit WOLF, reboot and reload it.  It's a good idea not to play with
full sized screen window.  I always go to largest window, then step back two
sizes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYING HINTS:  Most keys and some elevators are hidden.  Other than that,
you're on your own!  :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDITS:  I wish to thank both Ix and FRANK THE RABBIT for their kind help
and hard work in making ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE II possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTION:  I have been noticing trashed out copies of my earlier version
of this program floating around.  I have seen them with renamed archives,
missing files and BBS adverts splashed all through 'em.

This file is big enough without adding such bullshit as BBS ads to 'em. 
DO YOU HEAR ME, RUSTY-N-EDIE'S?  This is a practice I DO NOT approve of.  So
if you find any files other than the 6 mentioned in the above FILES LIST
section when you open the archive, remove those extra files before you
distribute NM-II to other people or BBSs.  

Also, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT distribute the archive under a different
name, DO NOT pass around incomplete versions, and distribute only ORIGINAL
ARCHIVE copies which you know are in good working order!  

Remember, this file is BIG and the next guy in line would like a working
copy after going to the trouble of downloading this program.  So only
distribute the original, intact, working archive!

Please spread this around so many can enjoy it.  And by the way, if anybody
out there has a high speed modem, please see that the original archive is
uploaded to SOFTWARE CREATIONS BBS (508) 368-4137 or 368-7036.  I'd really
like them to have a copy. :)

Thanks, and enjoy ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE II!
