ATTENTION:  ENITE3FX.ZIP

WELCOME TO THE SPECIAL INTERNET SCREWUP EDITION OF ENIGMA'S NIGHTMARE III.

File:  ENITE3FX.ZIP  (Enigma's Nightmare 3 FIX).... Contains known good
copies of the ENITE3F1.ZIP and ENITE3F2.ZIP archives to counteract the bad
copies found at various ftp sites.  Some ass knowingly uploaded a damaged
copy of Enigma's Nightmare III to the following Internet ftp sites:

ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca

ftp.uwp.edu

And Lord knows how many others...........

Since I do not have direct access to the Internet, ENITE3FX.ZIP is released
to various BBS in hopes somebody is kind enough to send it along to as many
ftp sites as possible.

PLEASE, use the file ENITE3FX.TXT in the main archive as your internet
descriptive text file when you upload the ENITE3FX.ZIP archive to an ftp
site. It's a copy of what you're reading now and should be used.

Regards, 

ENIGMA-13

PS... Please read the file NM3NOTES.TXT in the archive, for answers to
various questions about Enigma's Nightmare III.
