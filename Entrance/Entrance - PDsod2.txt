Description             : A single map for SoD. I made this map hard for
                          newbies and veterans. I used different textures to
                          give this map a colorfull look.
                                                                        
Instalation		: Before unziping this file into you're Spear of
                          Destiny folder, make a copy of the original
                          gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.wl6. When you have done
                          that, just unzip this file into the Spear of Destiny
                          folder and play the game.
