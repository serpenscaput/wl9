Hey fellow wolfers,

It's been quite a while since I released anything, so here's a taste of
Mac Wolfenstein for you PC players. I've tried to duplicate the experience
of playing First Encounter, including many of its "faults".

Much of the work in this package comes from previous releases:

base VSWAP - from Ripper's hiresvswap.zip
high resolution textures & sprites - from Tails *ORIGINAL*'s macgraphics5pz.gif
digitized sounds - from Laz Rojas' "Halten Sie!" (modified)
"Halt!" sound - from BJ Rowan's "Project: Totengraeber"
HUD BJ face - from Thomas Weiling's "Castle Assault" (heavily modified)
music - midis from Born4Battle and Phroggy's wolfmacm.zip
