Death Maps for Wolf 3-d version 1.0

    These maps are replacements for MAPHEAD.WL1 and MAPTEMP.WL1 
which are distributed with Wolf 3-d.  Copy the original MAPHEAD.WL1 
file to WIMPHEAD.WL1 and the original MAPTEMP.WL1 file to 
WIMPTEMP.WL1. The batch files DEATHMAP.BAT and WIMPMAP.BAT make it 
easy for you to change from one to another quickly.  They also 
keep you from accidentaly losing the original map files.
    
    These maps contain 7 of the most difficult levels you have ever
seen (IMNSHO). There are 5 regular levels a secret level and the 
final boss level.  At about 4 hours a level I couldn't bring myself
to finish the other three. Any thing I could think of was fair game
to put into the maps. I use 2 keys on a level, hide keys behind secret
doors and create small puzzles with secret doors.  I have many other
nasty tricks also so I won't tell you them all. ;)

    All of these maps were made with Mapedit version 4.  Many thanks
go to Bill Kirby for writing this wonderful piece of software.

    For the most fun while playing these levels:
        1) resist the temptation of looking at the maps.
        2) play on "I am DEATH incarnate"
        3) if you think you have tried everything, try something else
        4) keep saying to yourself, "It's only a game"

    Thanks for downloading my maps!
