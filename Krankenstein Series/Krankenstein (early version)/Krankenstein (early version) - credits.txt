This mod was made with Floedit 2, Paint Shop Pro 7 and my own Seefiles program.

Graphics and sounds (most are modified) come from...

Wolfenstein3D
Christmas Wolf
Lost Episodes
Hotel Romanstein
Schabbsdoom
Boesenstein.
However, I made most of the graphics and a few sounds myself.
The art is by Munck, Chagall and Rembrandt,
the photos are of Marilyn Monroe and queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
I was partly inspired by the thriller 'Coma'.

About this game...
Some levels are easy, some are difficult, floors 8 and 9 use some unusual secret doors.
No keys are behind secret doors, but the entire floor 8 is.
Some (but not all) locked doors are there for logical reasons and need not be opened.

The story...
You wake up at the morgue of a hospital led by dr. Krankenstein (a relative of Schabbs).
You must fight your way out, collecting evidence against the hospital,
and escape the doctor's clones on floor 8.

For more fun:
    make use of your dirty phantasy.
