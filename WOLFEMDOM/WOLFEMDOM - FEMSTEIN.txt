ABOUT LSH-SPAIN:
============

I appreciate the creativity of some modders which has inspired me, and I thank them all! What I find very disappointing is the lack of modern settings different than II WW. That's why I enjoyed Doomjedi's Femstein project, and I tried to develop an own mod with the following features:

- 1920-1930s decoration in walls and furniture, all in sepia color.

- femenine enemies which are elegant based on film noir.

- no violent guns but magic attack based on absorbing energy.

- symmetrical maps with new pictures and sprites in locked areas or after deaf guards.

- STRATEGY to plan your advance using a disguise, then dealing with guards. The level exit is easily found, but using keys is necessary also for finding energy and ammo. 

- REALISTIC amount of guards and necessary location of windows, baths, lighting, rest rooms, horses as mean of transport, food... 

Such a planned work have suffered a lot of changes. I.e. The distribution of a balanced amount of specific sprites for every 3 levels to create an own atmosphere, not to repeat too many in the same room, relate some guards to specific areas, progression with new sprites after finding specific keys...

However, I am so exhausted that some BUGS are still there from the original Femstein mod. I would appreciate the contribution of anyone able to solve them: 

- I found an error everytime I opened your mod with Chaosedit: Could not allocate memory for chunck 154. Wolf4SDL was not compiled for these data files: vgahead.sod contains a wrong number of offsets (174 instead of 170)! Please check whether you are using the right executable! (For mod developers: perhaps you forgot to update NUMCHUNKS?)

- There are two items which reduce your energy, but eventually you can't lose a life picking up them.

- I have not the knowledge to edit the original messages on the screen from Femstein.

- The original Spear of Destiny ending sequence is shown with a terrible palette.


Thanks for all the modders' examples and effort. I suggest to research and create more REALISTIC or FUNNY mods...
