A mod by -> Cabo_Fiambre

First of all huge thanks to Orka for allowing me to use his stuff and to Wolf3DGuy since the mod is mostly based on his 
amazing work from the Anniversary Edition of Wolfenstein 3D.

*** //// Â¿HOW TO PLAY? //// ***

To play the mod you must have installed DOSBox wich can be obtained from the official page.

https://www.dosbox.com/

* Install the program and open it.

* Once the program opens you will see a command line pop up.

* Write the next line -> mount c c:\sswii (the "C" represents the letter of the drive you have the mod installed on)

* If you did this successfully you will see the message "Drive C is mounted as local directory c:\sswii\"

* Next you must enter "c:" and once you press Enter you will see the lines at the beginning change to the drive you have
selected (in this case it should say C:\).

* Now you must write "wolf3d" and once you press Enter the game should start.

* Have fun!
