Hey there...

I was looking for MIDI's, which I know I have a lot of on some CD's. In my CD-archive, 
I also
found a burnt CD with an old game, which this is.

"Schabbs 7000" is unfinished, and was the first version of "Secrets of Offenbach". 
Most of it
is old and crappy, like my stuff were in the beginning of 2005, but it has a cool 
EXE and also
some possibilities with new objects and such, if you want an EXE and Map Editing 
files.

The game consists 3 or 4 levels...then there's some levels you must cheat to, but 
it's just 
testing keys and stuff.

Don't warp to level 20, then the game will close (It was supposed to be a new enemy, 
but it 
failed!). Otherwise, enjoy!
