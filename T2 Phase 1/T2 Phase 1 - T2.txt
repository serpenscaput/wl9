Here are 30 new maps for Wolf3D. This time I told myself, screw the rules! So brace yourself for maps featuring ridiculous amounts of enemies, holo-walls, holo-objects (yes!), keys in secret areas and much more. That said, a fair amount of the maps are just good and old-fashioned difficult. I took some liberties here and there, but the flow of the first three episodes is followed relatively well. I only used a handful of extra added walls from Spear of Destiny and I re-colored/re-designed a handful of walls too.

EDITORS USED:

MapEdit 8.4
ChaosEdit
Merthsoft's Wolf Re-Color

SPECIAL THANKS:

Immense gratitude to Chris Chokan for making me aware of this fantastic WL6MAX12 EXE. I suggest any DOS nut out there to use this instead of the slow-paced regular v1.4 EXE. Boo!

Hope you enjoy the set. Now - mach schnell! Or something.
