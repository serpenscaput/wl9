GLOOM: An add-on made by Commander Keen for the full version of Spear Of Destiny



Commander Keen made this add-on in 2001 when he was 10 years old. It was recently 
found again and is being released because he is working on a sequel called 'Gloomy 
World'.

There are 16 levels in 'Gloom'. Most of the levels are quite small though many are 
well detailed. Two levels (including the first) have 'invisible objects' at times. 
There are several graphics changes but the original Spear feel remains.

To play the game, the gamemaps, maphead and vswap files from this addon need to overwrite 
the original files in a copy of the full version of Spear Of Destiny.
