Thanks for downloading and playing "Wolfenstein Redemption" my newest set.

It contains, 10 brand new levels as well as some graphics changes and many other 
surprises.

I believe I've improved from my last set, "World War 3" by a lot and I think you 
will all be pleased with this pack.

The following is a small description of the levels :





Level 1 : Lower Level

This level is quite easy and is meant to ease the player into the game,
and get them ready for harder levels.

Look out for secret walls, especially in the last room :)



Level 2 : Castle Floor 1

I tried to make this level a bit harder than the first, again to get the player prepared 
for future challenges.

It has a slightly more complex layout and more enemies.



Level 3 : Castle Floor 2

Now it gets challenging :)

This is a confusing layout with several elevators, (one is real).

This level still confuses me...



Level 4 : Office Floor

This is the most confusing layout of the set. There aren't many enemies
because navigating the map alone is hard.



Level 5 : Castle Floor 3

Taking a break from the confusing layouts and adding more enemies for
this level.

Look out for Secrets.



Level 6 : Hud 1

Main area of castle, slightly confusing layout, with enemies to spare :)


Level 7 : Hud 2

Very much like level 6, only slightly more difficult.

Stop in the kitchen for a tasty snack :)



Level 8 : Castle Floor 4

Fairly straight forward layout wise, but the many enemies makes it 
worthy of being the last real level.


Level 9 : Boss


A very cool boss, the trick is to use the confusing layout of the arena you fight 
him in to your advantage.


Level 10 : Secret

This should look familiar :)





Well that's it, again enjoy and have fun with it!


And look for my next set, coming soon!
