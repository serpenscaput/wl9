Welcome to 60 New Levels of Absolute Carnage!
---------------------------------------------

Welcome to The Renovation II: Conflict in the Fatherland, the sequel to the
reknowned 60-level conversion entitled The Renovation, released by Apogee
software in the "Wolfenstein Super Upgrade" pack. Each and every level in
Conflict in the Fatherland is hand-crafted by expert level designer Brian
"B.J. Blazkowicz" Rowan, a total Wolfenstein addict for over 4 years now.
More attention is paid to graphic appearance and playability than ever
before...these levels are right on par with id Software's original levels. As
the designer, I made sure that all the levels offered a good combination of
hard-core Nazi-blasting action, and suspenseful atmosphere induced by
multiple secret rooms and realistic environments. And it's all backed by 6
involving storylines.

It is of the utmost importance that you refrain from contacting either Apogee
Software or id Software concerning these levels. They will not provide you

System Requirements
-------------------

You will need the VGA FILES of the 6-episode registered version of Wolfenstein 3D 1.4 for these levels
to work. 

============================================================================

WOLFENSTEIN 3-D: CONFLICT IN THE FATHERLAND
EPISODE ONE: Operation Schutzstaffel!	


The Story So Far...
You're William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the Allies' bad boy of espionage and a
terminal action seeker.

Allied intelligence reports that a run-down WWI German castle has taken on a
new use. It's now being converted into a training center for the
black-shirted Schutzstaffel, also known as SS -- the ruthless "police force"
of Nazi-controlled countries. Knowing the location of such a training center
gives the Allies a tremendous chance to gain some ground in the war, and
they're not taking any risks that might lose them that chance -- so they're
sending you to infiltrate the fortess and liqudate the trainees and any other
Nazis you encounter.

The castle is bound to hold many secret passages and caches of ill-begotten
treasure, not to mention a good number of SA, or Sturmabteilung -- the
brown-shirted Nazi goon squad. Don't get cocky and start thinking that SS
trainees are the only foes you'll face. There's bound to be some high-ranking
Nazi officers there to train them. Along those lines, intelligence reports
that the second-in-command of the SS -- Hans Grosse -- may be visiting the
fortress. If you should encounter him, use utmost caution in engaging. He is
a very dangerous little maniac indeed.

The fortress will be heavily guarded. Himmler's SS are extremely dangerous
enemies indeed. They may be accompanied by vicious guard dogs and their SA
buddies, sometimes all at once -- be cautious when entering unfamiliar rooms
and passageways. Do not assume secret areas are safe havens. The Nazis are
tricky and they may hide where you least expect them: next to doors, in
hidden rooms, and in niches in the walls. The castle is old and its
architecture is filled with such opportunities for your foes, who, unlike
you, know the layout of the castle. Essentially, they have the upper hand in
both manpower and knowledge of the battlefield. But you, B.J., have the upper
hand in brains, cunning, and killer instinctiveness. Which, I admit, would be
an insult to anyone else, but....we all know you, Blazkowicz.

One last note: you may find various opportunities to "bug out", as they say
in the air force -- in essence, to escape the castle and return home. You may
seize these opportunities if you choose, or, if your curiosity gets the
better of you, you can stay to search for alternate elevator shafts to
further areas of the fortress.

Good luck, B.J. The Nazis don't know that we know about their secret training
operation, and we'd like you to keep it that way until they're all lying
dead.


EPISODE TWO: Lethal Infestation
-------------------------------

In this episode, you are sent to investigate one of the Nazi's primary troop
lodging bunkers. Your primary mission goal is not to destroy all the Nazis
there; that's only your secondary objective. Your primary objective is to
discover what kind of evil creatures have been dismembering the guards
stationed there. The Allies have overheard Nazi reports that some kind of
uncontrollable infestation is taking place at Castle Eisenschwert, set high
atop a German mountain. The strangest of the intercepted reports center
around suspicion that a Nazi doctor named Schabbs has turned traitorous and
is somehow behind this whole mess. We have no further information on that
subject.

To prepare you for your mission, we have arranged this briefing for you.
There is an underground sewer that will allow you to enter the castle's
cellars unnoticed by the guards patrolling the area. The first level will
take place in the sewer system, and the second and third levels you will have
to work your way through are the basement floors of the castle. From there,
you'll have to cover the miscellaneous barracks, cafeteria, storage areas,
and other floors that make up the ancient castle. We currently have no data
at all on the eighth or ninth floors, except to say that the ninth floor is
most likely not used; it is a small floor that was added onto the top of the
castle after its completion. As soon as you secure the castle and stop the
infestation, get out of there as fast as you can and head home.

Once again, your main mission goal is to find out who or what is killing off
the Nazi guards on station in this castle. Not that we want to help the
Nazis; we want to eliminate the possibility of them harnessing the
destructive forces you'll be seeking and using them against the Allies. Good
luck, B.J.!


EPISODE THREE: Hitler's Hideout
-------------------------------

As the German troops in Russia are pushed further and further back and the
Allies make one strategic strike after another, it has finally become clear
to Adolf Hitler that the Third Reich has but a little time left. Unable to
accept failure, Hitler, driven insane, retreats to the lower levels of his
underground bunker in Berlin, surrounding himself with hundreds of Nazi
soldiers. From there he continues to use increasingly desperate tactics to
wage the second World War.

Only recently, the Allies intercepted coded information as to the whereabouts
of Hitler's titanic bunker. Having cracked the code, we've decided to send in
one man to attempt what even Hitler's own generals could not do: eliminate
the Fhrer. Captain Blazkowicz, we've selected you from the list of our best
soldiers for the job; your last few espionage missions were entirely
successful, and if anyone can complete this seemingly impossible task, we
think it's you.

Hitler's bunker is quite possibly the most heavily guarded structure in the
world right now. If you're going to make it in and out of there alive, you'll
have to keep your wits about you, and your firearm in hand at all times!
You'll be entering the bunker from the disguised ground-level entrance, and
proceeding down through the lower levels. This is going to be a tough
mission, Blazkowicz. Fight hard out there.


THE NOCTURNAL MISSIONS: Episodes 4-6

EPISODE FOUR: Subterranean Terror	
---------------------------------

Corporal Blazkowicz, you've been called here today because we believe you're
the best man for our latest espionage mission. Intelligence reports that they
have found the location of Otto Giftmacher's headquarters. Otto is the
designer of the Nazis' new chemical warfare unit. He and his "creations" pose
a large threat to the rest of the outside world. It's imperitave that you
infiltrate his headquarters and take him out before he can put his diabolical
weapons into action.

However, Giftmacher isn't the only one behind the chemical warfare unit.
There are two other Nazis who are crucial to the implementation of these
latest plans: Gretel Grosse and General Fettgesicht. Once you eliminate Otto
Giftmacher, look around and see if you can discover where his other two
cohorts are basing their operations. Get back to us with the details. Good
luck!


EPISODE FIVE: Bite the Bullet
-----------------------------

Having discovered the whereabouts of Gretel Grosse, overseer of the plant
that manufactures the bomb casings for Giftmacher's chemical weapons, you
(B.J. Blazkowicz) head for the office complex adjacent to the plant, where
Gretel has her main base of operations. If you can take her out and bring the
manufacture of the weapon casings to a grinding halt, the Allies will be but
one step away from putting down the Nazis' chemical weapons plot -- and that
step is the elimination of the supreme commander, General Fettgesicht!


EPISODE SIX: The Command Bunker
-------------------------------

With Gretel Grosse dead, the General realizes his plans are all but foiled.
Outfitting his impregnable command bunker with a heavy-duty assortment of
crack troops and Himmler's SS, the General plans to prepare the prototype
chemical weapons he keeps in his bunker and launch them against Allied
Forces. It is imperative that you, B.J., get in there and liquidate the
madman before he wreaks one helluva messy brand of havoc on the population of
earth.

This will be your most difficult mission to date, Blazkowicz. You'll be
facing more than a thousand Nazi troops, all fighting for their beliefs in
your very face! If you can survive the insane amounts of guard in the bunker,
you still have to take on General Fettgesicht, who has armed himself with a
chaingun and a Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher especially for your visit!
Grit your teeth and slam that pistol clip home -- your in for the fight of
your life!


Your Enemies
------------

If you are familiar with Wolfenstein 3D, you'll have no problem recognizing
most of the opposition. However, two of the enemies have been substantially
changed in graphic appearance. They are the SS soldiers and boss Otto
Giftmacher. The SS soldiers now wear the traditional black uniforms with
eagle-and-swastika caps. Old Otto, meanwhile, has been promoted to the
position of SS-Obergruppenfhrer; he's wearing a cyan-colored uniform which
has been adorned with many decorations. He's still packing a missile
launcher, so steer clear of him!


Your Weapons: An Inside Look
----------------------------

* Weapon #2: Walther Pistole 38 (P38)
The replacement for the P08 (Luger) handgun was the Pistole 38, or P38,
manufactured by Walther. This was a more rugged hand-gun and at 2.1lb heavier
than the P08. It also had an eight-round box magazine and fired its 9mm
parabellum ammunition with a muzzle velocity comparable to that of the P08.
It was a sturdy and highly popular weapon.

* Weapon #3: MP40 Submachine Gun (SMG)
The MP40 was an improved version of the MP38, which utilized cheaper
manufacturing methods. Like the MP38, it was a 9mm calibre submachine gun
with a 32-round box magazine feeding from underneath the weapon. It weighed
8.75lb and had a cyclic rate of fire of around 500rpm. Although a few early
models did have a wooden stock, the vast majority featured a collapsible
metal stock.

* Weapon #4: MG34 GPMG
This versatile, belt-fed 7.92mm machine gun weighed just over 26.5lb and
fired at a rate of 900rpm, with a muzzle velocity of 726mps (2500fps).
Generally fitted with a bipod, it could also be mounted on a heavy tripod for
the sustained fire role, and an anti-aircraft mount was also available. Like
most weapons dating from pre-war days, it was exceptionally well made, albeit
rather expensive to produce.


Credits & Thanks To:

OTHER WOLFENSTEIN STUFF BY B.J. ROWAN

The Renovation
--------------

These were the first 60 Wolfenstein episodes I ever designed, dating back to
January of 1994. They were part of a compilation known as Wolfmaster. This
compilation, which was organized by Carlton Griffin, was a package containing
well over 800 additional levels for Wolfenstein 3-D. It was sold by Apogee
Software, along with other utilities, as the "Wolfenstein Super Upgrades
Pack". Game C of Wolfmaster is The Renovation, containing 60 all new levels
by this author. Nowadays they are also available on my website, as more of my
contribution to history than anything else, since they really aren't that
great by my current standards. Still, I got a lot of great comments about
them back in the day!

Project Totengraeber
--------------------------------------------------

Want more Wolfenstein? B.J. is at it again, in over 45 more pulse-pounding
Wolfenstein levels, this time with brand new EXE file and a standalone game
installation, totally independent of the original game files. Project
Totengraeber is part of a whole new breed of Wolfenstein add-ons, featuring
continuous level flow, two additional keys, changed music and ceiling colors,
new graphics and sound effects, and five secret levels hidden somewhere for
you to find - no longer hard-coded onto particular floors! And as always,
designer Brian Rowan realizes that a great engine does not a great game make
- and so Project Totengraeber's new executable is backed up by the same kind
of professionally-designed levels as his last set - each intensely
atmospheric and immersive For you absolute Wolf addicts, this third map set
by "B.J. Rowan" is his greatest Wolf design accomplishment yet.

Enjoy the Game!
