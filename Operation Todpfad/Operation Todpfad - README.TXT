~ Introduction

Thanks for downloading Operation Todpfad, my Total Converison (TC) to revolutionary 
game "Wolfenstein 3D" the 1st First 
Person Shooter game made by ID Software in 1992. This game includes almost every 
graphic recolored, modified, or replaced. 
Half of the sounds are new and more than half of the VGA graphics are either recolored, 
modified, or replaced. Tons of features and enhancements have also been added, learn 
more about these in the "Features" Section. I hope you enjoy the game as much as 
I enjoyed making it.

~ Story
~
1945: A couple of days have passed by since Mr. Blazkowicz had brutally murdered 
Adolf Hitler in Castle Wolfenstein in Germany. After Mr. Blazkowicz mudered him, 
he thought that the whole Third Reich would fall to the depths of the sea and disappear 
forever, and that the world would restore itself and continue back where it left 
off before World War II.
Mr. Blazkowicz is still currently in the United States Army, ready to serve his country 
anytime to protect it from any harm. Eva Braun had a castle built for her, little 
after her husband died, she became depressed and turned her base outside of Berlin 
in a huge castle into a war scene. It had taken her time to come up with a plan to 
attack the United States and make sure Mr. Blazkowicz was dead. The HQ tells you 
that you must sabotage the plans and castle by any means nesscary and assassinate 
Eva.  You're our only hope BJ! You could be a much bigger hero!

Every game in the world has bugs, and unfortuantly, Todpfad has some too.

The game no long needs EMS to run thanks to Dugtrio17 reminding of a memory bug!!


Save Often-
- If you bomb out with any memory errors like "Out of Memory!". I'm sorry I've done 
all I can to prevent this fromm happening.

- Sometimes Guards have a delayed reaction, and just stand there or they keep walking 
by, if you wait a few seconds, they should get into Attack Mode
- The Border may blink, I don't know what causes this exactly, but to temporarily 
fix it, press T
- The Breakable Columns may not fall down correctly
- The old dreaded Digitized Silence occurs often in Todpfad, to fix it, press T
