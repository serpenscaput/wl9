30 YEARS OF WOLFENSTEIN 3D:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anyone reads this far or even clicks on a readme file anymore?

In 1992 and again in 1995 id Software released a game and tool that
has spawned fun, ideas and creativity for players around the world 
for many years. 

Anyways, to celebrate Wolf3D's 30th Anniversary and 30 years of modding
history, we, a group of dedicated lunatics, have gathered to create 
a somewhat entertaining tribute.

We hope to inspire more players to join this lunacy and keep the
mod scene going for at least another 30 years.



FEATURES:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On demand the obligatory feature list. 30 years have passed some things 
got rusty and to ensure newcomers don't get lost in vast mazes it comes 
with a few changes.


* Blood carnage (Aderlass to keep up with Wolf3D's edge for the next-gen audience)
* Blood on the walls (Not the Manny Charlton Band song)
* Vintage colors (The ray-printer ran out of ink)
* Changed floor and ceiling colors (have more color in your life)
* WASD controls (for the noobs)
* Mouse forward movement toggle (for the newbs)
* High quality ogg audio (We are not deaf yet)
* Sprite shadows adjusting to floor color (fuck brown MAC shadows on grey floor)
* Bullet trails (cause you are in the byte Matrix)
* Wall marks (For extra carnage)
* Extra Lives at 100K instead of 40K due to inflation
* 6 postcards to drop (We couldn't afford any automap system)
* Distance counter (Google maps didn't work so you got to play Marco Polo)
* Adjusted player and enemy attributts (Bit of necromancy here and there)
* Weapons are borked or not
* Increased map limits so less expensive duct-tape is needed

* 5th Difficulty for hitscan-maze-deficient people
* Guide bot on the 5th difficulty helping the blind and reflexless
