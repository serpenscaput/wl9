The Wolfenstein Collection - by MCS Amsterdam, The Netherlands
30 levels for Wolfenstein 3D

Storyline
=========

Don't let this name fool you... All of these are original levels, made
by yours truly.
When I started this several months ago, I planned to make a story about
good old Dr. Schabbs, when I found out this theme was already used by all
you add-on makers.
So I changed my mind and switched to a Blake Stone setting with scientists
and the lot, and when I was half-way, I saw this theme more than once again,
so I dropped this idea as well.
I left the music and sounds in though, I just wasn't in the mood to replace
everything again, the whole project consumed enough time already.
For now, I decided to forget about the storyline and just put my levels
together in this "collection". There's just no more to it.
Don't expect any "ultimate Totengraeber", it's not that good, but since I've
spent a lot of time playing other people's add-ons, I think I can say this set
should be pretty neat overall.

Legal stuff
===========

No limitations. ID gave Wolf to the public. Use this stuff as you want it.

Tools Used
==========

Good old Norton's Text Search
Paint Shop Pro 5.01
FloEdit 1.0 (I tried 1.1 as well, but it was very unstable here)
Mapedit 8.4
Cool Edit 2000 1.0
UltraEdit 7.10 (the ultimate editor!!)
VideoThief 0.07
Borland C++ 3.1

Modifications
=============

- Mine added
- 2 keys added
- New sounds
- New music (YES!)
- New objects, doors and walls
- New status bar (no big deal)
- End level warp like in SOD
- Health and ammo max.200
- You start with the knife only
- Scores above 1 million are now displayed correctly
- Space bar noise made less irritating :-)
- Seamless level progression
- and some other minor modifications

Some new graphics (some were home-made, others were taken from various
add-ons floating around, not sure where they originated, except for those from
"Project Totengraeber". Tried to contact the author several times with no luck)

Levels
======

All levels were made with the original game spirit in mind.
If you're looking for weird stuff like guards-walking-through-walls, things
like invisible objects, or 20 bosses in a level, you can skip this set.

Challenges
==========

There are several secret levels in this game, presented as "challenges".
Challenges contain lots of treasures, but you usually get only one chance
to grab them. If you miss this chance, you can only go back to the end-level
elevator. You can find this elevator typically near the starting position.
Hint: save your game BEFORE you start exploring a challenge. Examine the
environment carefully and choose your strategy accordingly.
Be careful: when you follow a guard that opens a locked door for you, and
you don't have the proper key for that door, you may get stuck in there...

Cheating
========

The MIL-keys have changed, but the new keys are not very hard to guess...
When you press the changed keys, you get:
- all 4 keys;
- 200 ammo and health;
- all weapons;
- a score of zero (and... no more scores are added!)
- you cannot save your game while in cheatmode!

Debug Mode
==========

I changed the "goobers" parameter as well.
I won't tell you what it is. You hackers can figure it out by yourselves :-)
Once in debug mode, you don't have to press Shift-Alt-Backspace.
Just hit Tab-[cheat] to start "debugging".
I restored Tab-N (no clipping) for your -and my- convenience.
In God Mode, there is no screen flashing when you get hurt.

Known Bugs and Limitations
==========================

As in original Wolf, digitized sounds disappear from time to time.
If this happens, press B-A-T to reset the sound to normal.
Some levels are very large; during the designing process I experienced the
E6M10 flashing border effect or even "out of memory" errors from time to time.
I tried my best to circumvent these errors. Hopefully they're all gone now.
Some bosses simply don't react when approached from a certain angle.
I've adjusted their position to avoid this behavior.
