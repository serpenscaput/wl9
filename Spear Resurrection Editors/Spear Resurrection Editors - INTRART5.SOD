^C6c "It is a wise man that fears the unknown, for those who know no fear will know 
sheer terror..." ^C00 - Baron von Schmitt.

^C00 Well, this is it. You've fought well, B.J. But now you face your greatest challenge. 
One man stands between you and the Spear. And that man is none other than Baron von 
Schmitt. But what do you fear the most? The Baron? Or the Spear? Go forth, B.J., 
and fight bravely!
