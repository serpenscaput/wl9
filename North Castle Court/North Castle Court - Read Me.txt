Knights of the SS : Armour of Beowulf. 
Mission 3 Castle Court v 1.0

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


* MISSION BRIEFING * 

 Location: Secret Catacombs that house the Grand Lodge of the Order of the Magi of 
the Radiant Star. 
 Date:     3rd of June 1937

Brother Mueller I have something most serious to ask of you on behalf of our Order, 
as a friend I would ask you not to go.. 
for it is gravely dangerous, but I also know how important it is for the resistance.

And I know you are the best agent for the mission.

My Brother we need you to sneak into the Castle of DOSenstein. 
We need you to investigate rumors that a newly formed division of the SS has refortified 
the Castle...
..And began working rites of dark magick, with powerful ancient relics.  
Our intelligence gathering points to the Knights of the SS a new exclusive order 
of elite SS officers, 
who are forging an Arayan warrior nobility of the Third Reich. 
 SchutzStaffel der Ritter Schwarze Sonne ...   They are said to venerate the Black 
Sun.
We have heard rumors..
That Knights of the SS leading Ahnenerbe recently recovered the mythical hero Beowulf's 
Armor and Sword Hrunting.

Our members in Allied Military and Intelligence report that an Allied spy BJ who 
escaped from Castle Wolfenstein, 
has been dispatched to recover the Spear of Destiny. 
We have also heard from connections in the French Resistance that the SS is now searching 
for the Holy Grail.
They have raided a catacomb under the Notre Dame Cathedral after translating some 
stolen documents from another order.  
They have also been said to be excavating Old Norse Runes. 

As a Magi and a Knight of the Silver Cross you know that we must investigate these 
claims and if they prove true..,
That we must stop them. 
If you choose to accept this mission we will use your code name Falcon 93 in all 
correspondence to protect your identity. 

Brother Mueller we have witnessed the Nazi Party take over our country, the Wermacht 
has already swept across Europe,
and with the power of these talismans the Knights of the SS could become an unstoppable 
force of Fascism.
I fear we may never again see liberty, but surely the power of the mighty Horus is 
with you, you are our best agent Johannes,
And yet should you fall in the sacred battle for freedom I will always remember you 
as a friend, 
and your sacrifice will not be in vain, this Aeon shall some day shine with freedom, 
may our grandchildren see that day. 
 
Do what thou wilt my Brother. 
Agent Falcon 93 Do you accept this mission?

In the SOD TC Series ‘Knights of the SS’

The mysterious order Magi of the Radiant Star has been building secret resistance 
networks to fight against the Axis Regimes. Agent Falcon 93 sneaks into Castle DOSenstein 
to discover the truth about K-SS in the ‘Armour of Beowulf’. 
In other Episodes….
Brothers and Sisters of the Magi Order use guns, magick, and guerilla tactics in 
the fight against Fascism,
 from forests and groves, to the dark Castles of Wewelsburg and DOSenstein, 
all the way to subterranean caverns and catacombs, as they take on Special SS Knight 
Squads, 
battle the UnDead, and powerful SS Priests. 
Recovering great artifacts from the Nazi’s such as Beowulf’s Armour and Sword Hrunting, 
Old Norse Runes, and the Holy Grail. 


In the yet to be named Wolf3d TC…
6 Episodes of Special Operations and Intelligence Missions with Allied and Resistance 
Forces…

Including a Joint SS and Luftwaffe Bunker with advanced technology and bio-medical 
research labs,

and plasmas weapons, 
and reverse engineered Extra-Terersestrial technology.  

More planned including a multi installment series of TC’s spanning Wolfenstein 3D, 
Spear Of Destiny,
DooM, Heretic, and Hexen. This would involve porting Wolfenstein into those games.

Where the player uncovers a Nazi Portal and fights through Mars, Hell, and other 
dimensions. 

Including an Egyptian Episode using the DooM, Heretic, or Hexen engine, 
where the Magi fight along side Egyptian Mummies(allies) against Rommel’s Afrika Corps

**        Knights of the SS : Armour of Beowulf.         **
             Alpha Demo Featuring 
             Mission 3 Castle Court (demo level 1)
            and Elevator Lobby ([filler] demo level 2). 
================================================

This is a very rough Alpha Demo by Falcon 93 Studios. It is a modification of Spear 
Of Destiny(TM - ID Software [see credits]).

The First level is actually mission 3 of an upcoming TC of SOD called Armour of Beowulf,

 from a planned series called Knights of the SS. 
The second level is just a filler, it is merely a small elevator lobby. 
The Demo version of Spear of Destiny has 2 levels. In the near future I will release 
an updated version,
 with a full second level.
This may be done with engine I started to edit code for, it currently supports a 
lighting effect and atmosphere i.e. rain. 

Later Falcon 93 Studios will release a full length Spear of Destiny Total Conversion 
with source code changes, 
more audio & graphical changes, new enemies and weapons, and special features like 
reanimating corpses, 
treasure fueled manna as ammo for magickal weapons, and more.

This Alpha Demo runs on the Spear Of Destiny Demo version engine and game files, 
it does not use any source code changes, 
or any original graphics. 
It does however feature an original level designed by J Falcon, 
and several sprite & texture graphics developed by members of the Wolf3d/SOD Modding 
community(see Credits),
 and the order of music has been changed, with some music imported from Wolfenstein 
3D. 


* Alpha Demo V 1.0  Release Notes * And Trouble Shooting * 

This demo show cases as much as possible without reprogramming, and within the limits 
of the slimmed down SOD demo version,
 the general atmosphere of Armour of Beowulf from my planned series, The Knights 
of the SS. 

The TC’s I have planned will feature much more extensive redesigning. 

In v 1.0 

The title screen is not satisfactory but it is suitable for an Alpha Demo. 
The pallet used by SOD for the title screen causes great difficulty. 
The issue is either that I could not get my image editors to work with the pallet, 

or the Wolf3d/SOD editors do not have the title screen pallet configured correctly, 

or something else is going on that I don’t understand yet. 
Suffice to say I simply had to guess which colors to use and then test how it looked 
after uploading the graphics. 

The enemies and static objects are maxed out, this may cause issues,
 but I have play tested it and I believe the common bugs are worked out. 

Run Castle Court (EXE) to play the game. 
It is a newer version of the Demo with some bugs patched.
I have also included a folder with the Patched Demo EXE and the Older Demo EXE. 


I suggest downloading VDM Sound and DOS Box. 
Without running through VDM Sound I have no music on my machine. 
Just download it(it is free), then right click Castle Court  (EXE) and select "Run 
with VDMS".

                 A Word On LIBERTY 


Liberty is our most precious prize. Let us not take it fore-granted. 
It has been said before and let it not be forgotten. 
Freedom Is Not Free. 
It is hard won and hard maintained. 
Its cost is the lives of those brave enough to fight for it, and their loss upon 
their friends and families. Words do no justice to widows who lay roses on the graves 
of lovers, to sons who’s fathers where tortured in POW camps, to mothers who buried 
their sons, or siblings who’s brothers and sisters paid the ultimate price for their 
freedom.  
Yet its privilege is the most rewarding of all. 
Because of freedom our children attend scouts and sports camps not Hitler Youth.


The cost of Tyranny is also high. The suffering of people to endure hunger, brutality, 
restriction, slavery, child labor, and draconian laws. 
From woman in the Syria who cannot show their faces for fear of punishment, to workers 
in South America earning scraps afraid to Unionize for fear of assassination. 
And the rewards of Tyranny are only enjoyed by those who reign over it. 

Not even a century ago we fought against the most ferocious and racist tyrannies 
the world has known in ages. 
Yet the struggle for freedom is not over. 
In many parts of the world tyrannical regimes reign over the people. 
From the DPRK in North Korea, to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. 

Oppression and exploitation are not just found in overtly tyrannical regimes; they 
creep their way in through corruption, and even loudly proclaim their campaigns in 
thinly veiled reactionary and populist speeches. 

Even in Europe and the Americas we have threats to our freedom, and political corruption. 


Alas fear not for the resounding voice of the new era is a battle cry for freedom. 

The forces of oppression will make their moves and will gain footholds but victory 
and Liberty awaits those who take a stand. 

It has also been said that evil prevails when good people fail to act. 
History holds this to be true. 

In the cause of Liberty, those who have the courage to act must take a stand. 

For some that might mean getting involved in local politics and the community, or 
even running for political office, or simply helping out in a soup kitchen on the 
weekends. 
For others that might mean joining the Military or Intelligence. 
It could even be forming a watch dog group that holds the government accountable. 

Or perhaps that means joining groups dedicated to values like Universal Brotherhood 
and Sisterhood, Wisdom, and Liberty. 


For those living under overt tyranny only the most courageous will take up arms against 
the regimes, there are resistance groups who fight against the Islamic State, and 
to them I give my most solemn respect, my heart truly goes out to them for they face 
hardships that I could never imagine. 

For those of us living in nations fortunate enough to have representative governments, 
however corrupt they may be; Let Us maintain our liberty that our countries may not 
fall under direct tyranny. Remember not to fall victim the lies of populist and reactionary 
speeches and political manipulations that breed division and hatred among the people 
and empower malicious sociopaths. 
Nor should we be distracted and sidelined by paranoid conspiracy theories that distort 
reality and instill a sense of powerlessness. 
Patriotism is not Nationalism, it is a reverence to the principals of Liberty that 
our Constitutional Democratic Republics where founded upon. 
There is no higher Patriotism than to defend Liberty. 

Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly, Free Elections,
Separations of Powers and Branches of Government, Checks and Balances,  

These principals and more keep us free. 
We must maintain them 
And Our Liberty. 

Stay Informed. 
Get involved. 
Respect other viewpoints.
Let Freedom Ring. 

- Falcon 93
