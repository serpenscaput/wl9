North Castle Court 
* MISSION BRIEFING * 
Location: Secret Catacombs that house 
the Grand Lodge of the Order of 
The Magi of the Radiant Star. 
 Date:     3rd of June 1937

 Brother Mueller 
I have something most serious to ask of you on behalf of our Order,..... 



 As a friend I would ask you not to go.. 
for it is gravely dangerous, 
but I also know how important it is for the resistance.
And I know that you are the best agent for the mission.
 My Brother we need you to sneak into the Castle of Dosenstein. 

Our Research indicates the site was first a Norse Fortress, in medieval times it was even once a colony of escaped Eunuchs, 
Then later the Order of Teutonic Knights built Castle DOSenstein on top the ruins. 
During the Renaissance the castle was renovated and Nobles from the 
House of Limburg lived in the castle when 
Siegfried Donner-Mann Limburg 
known as the "Thunder Man" purchased the castle. 


We need you to investigate rumors that a newly formed division of the SS has refortified the Castle...
..And began working rites of dark magick, with powerful ancient relics.  

Our intelligence gathering points to Ahnenerbe, the Nazi Research Group involved in studying Germanic Ancestral Heritage, and the Knights of the SS a new exclusive order of elite SS officers, 
who are forging an Arayan warrior nobility of the Third Reich. 
 SchutzStaffel der Ritter Schwarze Sonne ...   They are said to venerate the Black Sun.
We have heard rumors..
That Knights of the SS leading Ahnenerbe recently discovered the mythical hero Beowulf's Armor and Sword Hrunting.

As a Magi and a Knight of the Silver Cross you know that we must investigate these claims and if they prove true..,
That we must stop them.
 
If you choose to accept this mission we will use your code name Falcon 93 in all correspondence to protect your identity. 
Brother Mueller we have witnessed the Nazi Party take over our country, the Wermacht has already swept across Europe,
and with the power of these talismans the Knights of the SS could become an unstoppable force of Fascism.

I fear we may never again see liberty, but surely the power of the mighty Horus is with you, you are our best agent Johannes,
And yet should you fall in the sacred battle for freedom I will always remember you as a friend, 
and your sacrifice will not be in vain, this Aeon shall some day shine with freedom, may our grandchildren see that day. 



Do what thou wilt my Brother. 

 Agent Falcon 93 Do you accept this mission?

In the SOD TC Series ‘Knights of the SS’

The mysterious order Magi of the Radiant Star has been building secret resistance networks to fight against the Axis Regimes. Agent Falcon 93 sneaks into Castle DOSenstein to discover the truth about the K-SS in the ‘Armour of Beowulf’. 
In other Episodes….
Brothers and Sisters of the Magi Order use guns, magick, and guerilla tactics in the fight against Fascism,
 from forests and groves, to the dark Castles of Wewelsburg and DOSenstein, 
all the way to subterranean caverns and catacombs, as they take on Special SS Knight Squads, 
battle the UnDead, and powerful SS Priests. 
Recovering great artifacts from the Nazi’s such as Beowulf’s Armour and Sword Hrunting, Old Norse Runes, and the Holy Grail. 


In the yet to be named Wolf3d TC…
6 Episodes of Special Operations and Intelligence Missions with Allied and Resistance Forces…

Including a Joint SS and Luftwaffe Bunker with advanced technology and bio-medical research labs,
 where mad scientists are rumored to have created mutants & cyborgs, developed laser and plasmas weapons, 
and reverse engineered Extra-Terersestrial technology.  

More planned including a multi installment series of TC’s spanning Wolfenstein 3D, Spear Of Destiny,
DooM, Heretic, and Hexen. This would involve porting Wolfenstein into those games.
Where the player uncovers a Nazi Portal and fights through Mars, Hell, and other dimensions. 

Including an Egyptian Episode using the DooM, Heretic, or Hexen engine, 
where the Magi fight along side Egyptian Mummies(allies) against Rommel’s Afrika Corps and the Knights of the SS.

* ABOUT *

        Knights of the SS : BeoWulfenstein :         
          Episode 1      -     Armour Of Beowulf
                    *  North Castle Court  * 
             Prototype Demo : Independence Day Pre-Release 
    ================================================

This is a protype demo by Falcon 93 Studios. It is a modification of Spear Of Destiny(TM - ID Software [see credits]).

Running off of  SDM4SDL which is in essence a modified source code of the SDL port of the Wolf3D/SOD Engine, and using customized .SDM files, this demo just like the the original ID software Spear Demo only has two levels. 

This has lent very well for a demonstration of the games engine and feel. Many more changes are planned but for the purposes of a two level demo the engine and game files are quite sufficient. 

These two levels take place on the North Side of Dosenstein Castle, and will be Bonus levels in KSS BW1 Armour of Beowulf which will have over 20 levels, and will begin on the South Side of the Castle.   

Many graphics that where developed by members of the Wolf3d/SOD Modding community(see Credits),
 and the order of music has been changed, with some music imported from Wolfenstein 3D [and in the Independence Day Edition] Featuring Music from Therion and Lana Del Rey. 

Many new graphics where made by Falcon 93. 
In this edition all the Sprites from EOD by ArEyeP & MCS, that where used in the Alpha Demo DOS SDM release have been replaced by Falcon 93 graphics, and while they have been replaced I would still like to thank ArEyeP & MCS for releasing those graphics for the community to use. 

Many code changes where made, and it was quite an ordeal, as I do not yet understand C++.
I would like to give an extra special thanks to Chris Chokan, AlumiuN, Arayan Wolf3d, and Tricob for helping me with these changes. Without them this literaly would not have been possible for me to do. 
I have learned a bit about the code, and C++ from tutorials, trial and error, community members, and youtube videos, but now that the Protype Demo is out, I am switching gears to learning C++ and getting to know the Wolf4SDL source code,  before I endeavor any further KSS development.

                 A Word On LIBERTY 


Liberty is our most precious prize. Let us not take it fore-granted. 
It has been said before and let it not be forgotten. 
Freedom Is Not Free. 
It is hard won and hard maintained. 
Its cost is the lives of those brave enough to fight for it, and their loss upon their friends and families. Words do no justice to widows who lay roses on the graves of lovers, to sons who’s fathers where tortured in POW camps, to mothers who buried their sons, or siblings who’s brothers and sisters paid the ultimate price for their freedom.  
Yet its privilege is the most rewarding of all. 
Because of freedom our children attend scouts and sports camps not Hitler Youth.

The cost of Tyranny is also high. The suffering of people to endure hunger, brutality, restriction, slavery, child labor, and draconian laws. 
From woman in the Syria who cannot show their faces for fear of punishment, to workers in South America earning scraps afraid to Unionize for fear of assassination. 
And the rewards of Tyranny are only enjoyed by those who reign over it. 

Not even a century ago we fought against the most ferocious and racist tyrannies the world has known in ages. 
Yet the struggle for freedom is not over. 
In many parts of the world tyrannical regimes reign over the people. 
From the DPRK in North Korea, to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. 

Oppression and exploitation are not just found in overtly tyrannical regimes; they creep their way in through corruption, and even loudly proclaim their campaigns in thinly veiled reactionary and populist speeches. 




Even in Europe and the Americas we have threats to our freedom, and political corruption. 

Alas fear not for the resounding voice of the new era is a battle cry for freedom. 
The forces of oppression will make their moves and will gain footholds but victory and Liberty awaits those who take a stand. 

It has also been said that evil prevails when good people fail to act. 
History holds this to be true. 

In the cause of Liberty, those who have the courage to act must take a stand. 

For some that might mean getting involved in local politics and the community, or even running for political office, or simply helping out in a soup kitchen on the weekends. 
For others that might mean joining the Military or Intelligence. 
It could even be forming a watch dog group that holds the government accountable. 
Or perhaps that means joining groups dedicated to values like Universal Brotherhood and Sisterhood, Wisdom, and Liberty. 


For those living under overt tyranny only the most courageous will take up arms against the regimes, there are resistance groups who fight against the Islamic State, and to them I give my most solemn respect, my heart truly goes out to them for they face hardships that I could never imagine. 

For those of us living in nations fortunate enough to have representative governments, however corrupt they may be; Let Us maintain our liberty that our countries may not fall under direct tyranny. Remember not to fall victim the lies of populist and reactionary speeches and political manipulations that breed division and hatred among the people and empower malicious sociopaths. 
Nor should we be distracted and sidelined by paranoid conspiracy theories that distort reality and instill a sense of powerlessness. 
Patriotism is not Nationalism, it is a reverence to the principals of Liberty that our Constitutional Democratic Republics where founded upon. 
There is no higher Patriotism than to defend Liberty. 

Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly, Free Elections,
Separations of Powers and Branches of Government, Checks and Balances,  

These principals and more keep us free. 
We must maintain them 
And Our Liberty. 




















Stay Informed. 
Get involved. 
Respect other viewpoints.
Let Freedom Ring.
