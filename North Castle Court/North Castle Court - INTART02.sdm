^C7c North Castle Court
^C7d Objective : Gain Entrance to Dosenstein Castle via the North Castle Court

^C00 Inteligence Reports Indicate that there is an elevator in the North Court to a structure that connects to the 
North Outer Defensive Complex. Be careful a source within the SS tells us that this area is heavily manned at times when it is being used to initiate promising Ahnenerbe SS men into KnightHood.
