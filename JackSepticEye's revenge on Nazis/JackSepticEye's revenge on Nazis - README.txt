This is JackSepticEye's revenge on Nazis.

Story: You are JackSepticEye, who tries to enter the World War II era by means of time machine. Upon entering, you are arrested by the Nazi soldiers, which they know you are the spy and the Jew. You were sent to the prison camps of Germany but fortunately you had your expertise in attacking as well as the way to escape. When Nazis found that out, they tried to attack you, but in vain. Interestingly enough, you freed all prisoners and mobilized them with weapons, but it is not until that there is a stronghold that there are ramaining Nazi officers that survived the outbreak you started against them. Unfortunately for you, there are five bosses which are the evil clone of your friends that almost resembles the five in appearance, namely Markiplier, Yamimash, LordMinion777, PewDiePie, and worse, JackSepticEye. (in robotic form!) Yet, the real 5 unlike the 5 mentioned as the bosses are your true allies as the POWs. What is suprising is that the Nazis have developed their first supercomputer after they stole your gaming PC as they teleported to your time (namely 2016) and that they are attempting to be smarter than that of the Allies. Fortunately your arms are superior than that of the Nazi's. You have the USP-45 Pistol, the AK-47 assault rifle, as well as the M249 machine gun, whereas the Nazi used their old machine guns and pistols against you. Take care, there are lots of Nazis in the bulwark that protects the Nazis from your attack and sight. If you are using the M249 machine gun, beware! There is a loud firing sound that signals itself as high-powered, and that your enemies should treat you with extreme caution but that does not fool the bosses, as they have the powerful weapon with themselves. Alas, at the last level, you will see your infamous archenemy BILLY who cannot be defeated at any cost, but there is a vulnerability for Billy, which is that he goes slower in pursuing you.

If you don't know how to play yet the Wolfenstein 3D (although I may not know whether or not you did play that game), here are the guides (you can go to "Control", and then "Customize controls" and then presto!):
= Go forward: W
= Go backward: S
= Go left: A
= Go right: D
= Fire: Left-click
= Use*: Space and Right-click
= W + Shift: Run
= 1: Knife
= 2: Pistol (USP)
= 3: Machine Gun (AK-47)
= 4: LMG (M249)
= Escape: Menu/Pause

*This applies when you are opening doors, or finding secret passages.

DIFFICULTY*:
= I am not ready yet :O (for beginners)
= Please less violence.. (for average players)
= Fight me like a man! (for expert players)
= LIKE A BOSS!!!** (for hardcore gamers and YouTubers (like JackSepticEye))

*There are the default formats of difficulty from the original game:
= Can I play, daddy?
= Don't hurt me.
= Bring it on!
= I am death incarnate!

This difficulty is more difficult than you ever think, as there are TONS, I mean literally TONS, of enemies in the map as well as the boss. I hope that JackSepticEye uses that difficulty as I have watched his videos that he accomplished an almost impossible task that no one have conquered.

If you are JackSepticEye or a hardcore gamer, try "LIKE A BOSS!!", this will be fun as you will enjoy the moment of shooting! ;)

-Hope that JackSepticEye plays this! :)
