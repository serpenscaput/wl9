He was just a flying whirly-machine!  You step on his mechanical/organic mashup of 
a brain and spit on the remains.  The world is better off without this lunatic.

Allied forces are dropping in and exterminating the rest of the hideous cat creatures. 
 The world is saved from yet another crazy Nazi plan!
