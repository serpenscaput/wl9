37 1/2 Encounter
by AstroCreep

This is a map set for ECWolf/LZWolf, based on my earlier released resource
pack EC_MacWolf (Look how easy it is to build mods with this - it took a few hours 
of making new
sprites and I was ready to make maps)  This is inspired by the MacWolf scenarios 
released
from the years of 1996-1999, especially the works of Laz Rojas, Clubey and YYR.  
As such this
is mainly built from stock MacWolf resources and a few select extras from Laz and 
Clubey's archives,
and while this uses minimal mapping features such as ROTT elevators and switches, 
it still retains that
old MacWolf feel.

STORY:

For the 37 1/2 time, BJ has been called in to investigate yet another fantastic and 
weird Nazi
experiment.  This time, rumors are that they are combining cat DNA with POWs to make 
weird 
psychotic cat creatures.  This sounds pretty far fetched, but after the zombie thing, 
who knows?
