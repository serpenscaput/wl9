More info:

Wolfenstein XL was created to let wolf fans enter the ALL TIME
WOLFENSTEIN HIGHSCORES. But since the GAME itself is exactly the 
same as the original, you won't need to keep the original version 
of Wolf3D after updating to Wolfenstein XL (plus, this version 
takes up 500K less hard drive space because of it's connection
with Chokage.)


*******************************
How to get in the Highscores: 
*******************************

Whenever you notice your score/time is large enough to go into the 
'Wolfenstein All Time World Records Page', instead of typing 1 in
the WOLF-XL Menu to play Wolfenstein, type 3 (will appear after you
save your game). Rules are as followed:

  Score competitions:

   - No rules, save your game anywhere in the game, and if your score is
     in the top 10 of it's class (episode), and it will be added.

  Time Competitions:

   - For an EPISODE record time, save your game anywhere in level 9 of
     THAT SAME episode after you've raced through it.
   - If you're sending in a time for a LEVEL (if available), make sure to 
     save your game INSIDE the ending elevator of that level.


Good luck!
