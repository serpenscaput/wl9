To use cheats, you don't have to write any additional text in a command line or anything 
like that. All you need to do is simply press the [Tab]+[key] combination while in 
the game, according to the following codes:

[Tab]+Q - fast quit
[Tab]+E - quit level
[Tab]+T - teleport to level
[Tab]+I - immortality (you won't be getting any points)
[Tab]+P - pause
[Tab]+S - slow motion
[Tab]+F - facing spot
[Tab]+H - hurt self (only when you are mortal)
[Tab]+C - count objects
[Tab]+B - border color
[Tab]+M - memory info

Note that after pressing the combination of M, L and I your health will be reduced 
to 1 percent, and ammo to 1 bullet, you won't get any keys, and your weapon won't 
change. Have a nice day.
