Welcome! Randomizer's goal is to try and create a spin on gameplay for Vanilla Wolf3D, 
and traditional
mods.

To play, simply drop the Wolf4SDL.exe and accompanying .DLL files into your Wolf3D 
game install! This
requires a complete set of .WL6 files to run. Make sure you delete any old CONFIG.WL6 
files or the game
will crash.

At present, Randomizer allows the player to play the normal game with no differences 
if they wish, but
with the added option to use modern WASD+Mouse controls.


Additionally, two new "Difficulties" are added to the game:

RandomX: Choose a density level from 1-10, then play maps with completely randomized 
placement of enemies.
You can get lucky with barely any enemies in a level, or you could get absolutely 
swamped by mutants.
Luckily you have infinite lives, and any treasure you manage to collect will increase 
your max health and
ammo for as long as you stay alive. Die, and both will reset.
There's also some added variety in enemies with the intention of making things a 
bit more interesting; it
might become preferably to target a certain enemy because of the benefit it provides.


Boss Run: Play through an episode of the game, with nothing but bosses!
Ammo and health randomly litter the level, and there are 12 varieties of boss in 
the game, though new ones
will be a rarer occurance.

RandomX mechanics

Prestige System:

If you gain enough maxhealth/maxammo in RandomX, you will be given the chance to 
prestige on a new level! Prestiging gives
you access to new weapons.

Prestige Levels:

Level 1 - Costs 50 maxhealth/maxammo - Gives the player a Chain Gun
Level 2 - Costs 150 maxhealth/maxammo - Gives the player a Fire Trap
Level 3 - Costs 300 maxhealth/maxammo - Gives the player a Rocket Launcher
Level 4 - Costs 150 maxhealth/maxammo - Gives the player bouncing rockets
Level 5 - Costs 400 maxhealth/maxammo - Gives the player a flamethrower

Each level can only be unlocked after unlocking the previous level, and will persist 
on death.

New Weapons:

- Fire Trap: This weapon deploys a fireball that sits stationary. When it comes into 
contact with an enemy
it will kill them and anything surrounding them.

- Rocket Launcher: What it says on the box.

- Flamethrower: Spray shot flamethrower, does massive damage.

Enemy Types:

- Green Guard and SS: These enemies are melee enemies, and will poison you with their 
bite!
- Brown SS: This gentleman shoots rockets at you, and if killed will give the player 
BLOODLUST, allowing you
to shoot faster and absorb health from successful hits.
- Red SS: This SS will spawn dogs to join the fight.
- Grey Mutant: The Grey Mutant is rare, and moves quicker than the normal Mutant. 
On death he drops the
BULLDOZER powerup; this powerup grants 10 seconds of godmode, and any enemy you touch 
will die. Very good
for clearing a busy room.
- Brown Mutant: Hey Mo! This mutant explodes on death, killing any Nazis surrounding 
him.
- Green Officer: Beware their syringes! If you're hit, the poison will take hold, 
damaging you every few
seconds. Collect any item that provides health to remove the poison.
- Pink Officer: Doesn't attack you, but when he takes damage he unleashes fireballs 
in all directions.

/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/=/

Boss Run mechanics:

Boss Run gives the player a few means to help fight off the growing waves of bosses 
they face.

Syringe: The Syringe weapon is accessed with the 5 key, and freezes the enemy for 
a period of time. They can still take damage.

Shield Weapon: This weapon will consume ammo but in exchange cover you in a blue 
haze that absorbs all
incoming damage.

Plasma Gun: Shoots a bouncing fireball.

Any buffs to maximum ammo and health will stay with you from level to level. While 
your new weapons may
chew a lot of ammo up in the beginning, in later levels that won't be a problem and 
you can have some fun.

Special Bosses:

- RED HANS: Flamethrower
- Brown HANS: Rocket launcher
- Green SCHABBS: His blood is infused with...something else.
- SPECIAL HITLER: He will get help
- SPECIAL GIFT 1: RAPIDFIRE rockets
- SPECIAL GIFT 2: Rockets go through objects
- SPECIAL GRETEL: Homing flames
- Special Fatface: Homing rockets

Killing a special boss will grant +25 maximum health.

Known bugs:

- This mod will work with any mod of the registered version of Wolf3D that doesn't 
change the original EXE.
However, a changed VSWAP file might result in certain "special" enemies being coloured 
weirdly. This is due
to how Randomizer changes the enemies to be identifiable in RandomX and Boss Run. 
Replacing the VSWAP will
be the only way to "fix" it.

- Sometimes mouse-turning can lock up in WASD. Tapping right click will fix this.


To be done:

- More enemy types for Boss Run
- Balancing of various sections

Randomizer wouldn't be possible without the assistance of the following people and 
organizations:

id Software, Ripper, and 3DRealms. For Wolfenstein 3D, Wolf4SDL, and for code excerpts 
from Rise of the
Triad, respectively.

Nexion, linuxwolf, Chris, AryanWolf3D, Wolf3DGuy: Thank you for helping me with understanding 
the source,
troubleshooting, and for helping me achieve things (And outright providing me with 
code at times!)

Thank you to everyone who provided tutorials on DHW, from which I have chopped changed 
and combined many
to obtain the effects I've needed. Notable mentions go to Ripper, WSJ, Chris, Richter, 
among SO many others.
There is a wealth of knowledge that has been built up over the passed 16 years and 
is has been invaluable.

And a big thanks to everyone who tested this on Discord! It was a blast making this.
