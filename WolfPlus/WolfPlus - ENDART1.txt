Our hero rises victorious once again! The bad guys are all dead and peace is restored... for a while at least!
What big adventure awaits ahead for BJ? What nazi master plan is he going to sabotage next? 

30 years later since this game's release our protagonist returns ready to kick some butt!
And as long as there is talented people out there willing to tell their stories he'll be coming back once again to save the day.

Thanks to the community who supported and encouraged me to keep modding and improving!
I'm eager to continue in this journey but in the meantime i'm going to take a break and focus on other matters.

Take care everybody and keep on modding!
