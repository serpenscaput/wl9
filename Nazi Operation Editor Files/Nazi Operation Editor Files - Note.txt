Here's the editor files for Nazi Operation.

I know it's not as big as seen Totengraeber or Spear Ressurection files be released.
But I hope you will take a look in my maps, because my skills are getting better and better.

This game was finished at December 29th, 2005.

In this zip is also a debugmode parameter for the game. 

TAB+G for Godmode.
TAB+N for No-Clip mode.
TAB+Z for Screenshot.

And that's about it.
