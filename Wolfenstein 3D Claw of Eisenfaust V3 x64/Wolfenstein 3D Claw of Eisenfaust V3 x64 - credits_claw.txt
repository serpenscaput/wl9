WOLFENSTEIN 3D: CLAW OF EISENFAUST (x64 edition)
Port of SNES Wolfenstein to ECWolf
12/27/18 	AstroCreep
v2 5/17/19

This is a port of the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D to
ECWolf.  This uses Executor's Second Encounter port as a
base, and then adds assets directly imported from the SNES
version of Wolfenstein. All sprites,textures and sounds
have been replaced with SNES counterparts, censorship and 
all.  Save the free world from Staatmeister and his Master
State!

VERSION 2
This version has been completely rebuilt, based off of
the actual extracted SNES maps and ec_snes/ec_macwolf.

X64 VERSION

This version cuts out most of the new textures in favor
of the original x64 textures, so now the mod only 
includes censored alternates of the original walls
(by AstroCreep) as well as a new brick texture
to better fit the SNES styled texture (Thanks
Dunkelschwamm - Red Block Wall from The Dunkelcollection)
This also changes all the palettes with the exception
of the title screen to the original Wolf3D palette.
This also has a new status bar, based off of the 
vanilla status bar but re-arranged in the way the
SNES HUD was laid out.
