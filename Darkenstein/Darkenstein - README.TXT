Welcome to Darkenstein 1.3! This readme file contains information on
the story, installation, cheats, trouble shooting, and info on contacting 
me.

This zip file contains the following files:
MAIN.DRK=The image information.
MAPS.DRK=All the maps and object information.
MAPS2.DRK=Another necessary map file.
README.TXT=This file! (DUH)
DARKIN.BAT=Installation file.
DARKOUT.BAT=Un-installation file

PERSONAL NOTE: During the making of this, what I consider the best and
the definitive Darkenstein, The NEC laptop that I was creating it on,
crashed. Everything was lost. Fortunately, some of the files were backed up,
but these were older files, and some of the coolest things were lost.
Because of apparent software and/or hardware problems, some of them couldn't 
be brought back. Darkenstein 1.3 originally had invisible walls, but for
some reason, the program froze up when I tried to rebuild it. 
	I apologize for any problems that might be created because of the
crash. Despite all of the bugs and let downs, I have tried to produce a 
product that can entertain the small crowd this will reach. I am proud
of it, and I wish you the best.

	                     STORY:
You are B.J. Blazkowicz, the hero of the famed "Operation Wolfenstein" 
mission. You returned home from the horrors you experienced as a spy for
the good ol' USA. You were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
However, just when you kick off the boots covered with Nazi
blood, you recieve a top secret message from the President himself. You 
carefully decode it, and read it:
TO B.J.
DE BIG CHEEZE
SCHABBS IS BACK. BE AT WHITE HOUSE AT 1200 HOURS TOMORROW.
OUT.
You speak with the President the next day, and he tells you that the evil
Dr. Schabbs has somehow re-animated himself and his hords of guards,
officers, SS's, and his own undead Mutants. You must go back to Castle
Hollehammer and wipe out Dr. Schabbs forever!

                 INSTALLATION:
To install Darkenstein, type "DARKIN" at the dos prompt. You must have all of
the Darkenstein files in your Wolf3d directory. That's it! It will make backup
files for you, and if you don't like Darkenstein 1.2, type "DARKOUT", and
your original wolf files will be replaced! EASY!

	Then go into Wolfenstein 3D and select the first mission. This is the 
Darkenstein mission. If you play in "Can I play, Daddy?" mode, there is almost 
no challenge. Using "Death Incarnate" mode is more fun. 

                      NEW FEATURES IN "DARKENSTEIN"
Darkenstein 1.3 has tons of new and different features from the original
Wolfenstein and even the Darkenstein version 1.0 and 1.2. Oddly enough,
1.1 was never released for a few reasons I won't go into. Here are the 
changes from 1.2:
New Levels:Instead of the old 6 level version, now you have a complete 9-level
mission!
Several new wall images,
Ammo images changed,
Door images changed,
Enemies now melt into a puddle of ooze,
Red Ghosts replace Dogs,
Weapons slightly changed.
 IF ANYONE CAN HELP ME INSERT NEW SOUNDS OR IF YOU HAVE A PROGRAM THAT 
ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT PLEASE CONTACT ME!

                           CHEATS
To use the cheats in Darkenstein, you need to type "goobers" after the
executable command. When you are in a game, press and hold down 
LEFTSHIFT, ALT, BACKSPACE. Then you press and hold down TAB and one of
the following letters for the desired cheat:

E=Exit Level
W=Warp
B=Border Color
S=Slow Motion
I=Free Items
V=Extra Vertical Blinking Lights
These also work for regular Wolfenstein.


                            TROUBLE SHOOTING:
Don't have enough memory:Edit your config.sys file to free up memory or
create a boot disk.

Game keeps freezing up OR the images look all wierd: You are using shareware.
 You can only use Darkenstein with registered Wolfenstein 3D 1.4. DUH!

I'm stupid. I don't understand this readme file at all:You can't fix stupid.
You can try, but you can't fix stupid.

Darkenstein 3D 1.0, 1.2, and 1.3 was created by Daniel Young
Wolfenstein 3D was created by ID software and distributed by GT Software
