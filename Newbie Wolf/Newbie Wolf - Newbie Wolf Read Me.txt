Newbie Wolf by Milanor

Hi all, this is my a demo of my first mod that I have created.  I worked on another mod back 
a few years ago but then took a break from it, and now I have come back to restart another 
project. This mod is basically a noobie friendly mod, where people with no experience or some 
experience for the game would be introduced to the old school wolf3d like mods. 

There are a few changes in source code, which includes having much more ammo, even more health to 
begin with, and also the knife is a silent weapon. The MLI cheat is disabled since there is no point in 
using it in an already easy mod. The ammo and health given is extremely forgiving. I have also decided to make 
this a seamless mod as well as enabling a read this! option in the menu (yes the read this is still vanilla but 
will be modified in the final version). 

This is only a demo so I don't have many levels out, except for a few. This is still a work in progress, 
but I thought I'd share my work that I have made in a few days and get feedback from others. I'm not really 
a pro at coding stuff, but I'm still learning myself. 

Also, there are still some minor bugs that I am trying to fix such as trying to get BJ's face to scale 
properly, I found a temporary workaround, but creates another problem, which is where BJ's face is changing 
much earlier than scaling later on.
