This file contains some tremendously difficult levels for
use with Spear of Destiny.  Levels available are 1-12 and
the secret levels connected to a couple of those levels.
Levels 1-4 and 19 were done by Butch Nordstrom, but I 
took the liberty of altering them a bit to make them
slightly easier (there was one level where Butch had put
seven or eight BIG guys (Barnacle, Death Knight, etc.) -
so I deleted four or five of 'em!  BUT, most levels be-
yond level 4 have at least 2 big guys each!  In a few
weeks, I should have more levels to add on to this file.
You'll need to unzip this file into the directory where
your Spear game is loaded.  You should rename your cur-
rent GAMEMAPS.SOD and MAPHEAD.SOD to something else BE-
FORE unzipping, since the new files will write over any
other file existing with the same names.

I'd love to hear your comments -- best way to communicate
with me is through Prodigy.  My ID is BJRC09A....

Happy shooting!
