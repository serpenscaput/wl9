Nazis managed to bring a supernatural being to their aid. That's what they think, 
at least. 
This creature you will meet cannot be killed. You can slow it down by shooting it, 
but you should focus in getting rid of it by other means.
If you waste too much ammo, you may get doomed later. Ignore it in the best way you 
can.
