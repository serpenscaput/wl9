Right at the beggining of this level, you will find a room with several artifacts 
of decay protecting its entrances. 

In the middle of this room, there's something that will definitely help you get past 
the last obstacle of the floor.

Although that's not necessary to beat the level, it's highly recommended you make 
some effort to do it. And do it now, because you may not have this chance again later.
