^C7eCONGRATULATIONS!
^c00You were found unconscious by police
a short ways from the burning studio. You
are arrested and charged on thousands of 
counts of murder but are ultimately found 
unfit to stand trial and commited to an 
institution. 
^P
In the aftermath of the massacre and the 
events preceding it, the Bundestag hold a
formal inquiry into what they call a 
"mafia culture" surrounding childrens 
entertainment. Shortly after, legislation
is passed which effectively bans 
commercialized childrens television in 
Germany. Most other countries are 
similarly horrified and follow suit.
^P
Despite the fire, the incident and 
subsequent inquiry produces mountains of
evidence  implicating DNP, VBK and 
Senseloch in money laundering,  
racketeering, drug trafficking and
crimes against the constitution. 
Several of the organizations top leaders 
are imprisoned and though the far right
remains  a threat to the constitutional
order of Germany, it is not until 
well  into the 21st century that 
they are able to claim the support
they previously held
^P
Siegfried the dinosaur is put into 
indefinite syndication immediately 
after the massacre. As new revelations
come to light, public  opinion turns 
against the show and it is 
eventually banned under section 86a
of the German criminal code.  
Despite this,  clandestine 
screenings by neonazi groups remain
a fact of life for many years to
come. 
^P
You spend the rest of your life in the 
institution. The doctors promise to release
you if you recant your earlier testimony 
but you stand firm. In your few lucid 
moments between doses of antipsychotics,
you recall the final battle. You blazing
away, blowing  limbs and chunks of flesh 
off of what surely could only be a man 
in a foam  suit who somehow still comes
after you. After he finally collapses, 
you rush to the  bloody remains and pull
off the tattered head of the costume 

Thats when you blacked out
^P 
Thanks for playing ^c7e"THE PURPLE REICH" 
^c00Watch out for more Wolfenstein 
adventures on the cutting edge of
good taste coming soon to a PC near
you!
