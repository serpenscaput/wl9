The Spear has a mixture of original Wolfenstein 3D and Spear songs and carefully 
selected imported music from verious sources such as Reactor's collection of IMF 
files and End of Destiny. But alternatively are this collection of included midi 
files, these midi files have been named for most reccomended use eg 1 level 1 or 
16 level 16 but it doesn't matter that much. To play a midi file in this mod just 
click on desired midi file, minimise the player and boot up this mod's exe file, 
to change the midi file while in game you can simmiltainiously pres alt and space 
bar or press the windows key. To get back into the mod double click it's minimised 
exe on the start bar. Or have the songs in a playlist works well. These midi files 
are from verious different sources including Reactor's carefully selected midi file 
pack, some songs are from games such as Rise of the triad, Doom 2 and Duke Nukem 
( mabye ) and alot of other midi files I believe are from Doom 2 mods. There are 
also quite a few songs from Wolfenstein mods including Spear End of destiny and Mutant 
uprising project. All credit goes to the rightfull composers of these songs.
