KNOWN BUGS -
-	When changing the music volume in the sounds menu, the sound effects volume is 
also affected.
-	The game will sometimes randomly crash when a sound plays at the same time that 
the game's music begins to loop. This only occurs with MIDI music
		from what I can tell.
-	The game may start up slowly due to the large amount of data present. This is not 
necessarily a bug, but just be ready for a bit of a wait between
		the Title screen and the menu.
-	The cheat command "tedlevel" does not function properly and the game will crash 
when using it to start a new game.
