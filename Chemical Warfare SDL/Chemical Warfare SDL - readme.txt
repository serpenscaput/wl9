For those of you who are looking for info on the features or levels, I have this 
to say to you:

PLAY THE GAME! You'll have a lot more fun figuring out stuff for yourself. Don't 
worry about getting discouraged either - if you're really really stuck on the levels, 
I can give you a nudge in the right direction if you e-mail me at wolf007jack (at) hotmail.com, 
but I doubt you'll need it.

TOOLS USED:

Mapedit 8.4 	- Levels
Floedit 1.1 	- Various Things
Wolfedit 2.1 	- Graphics
Imf Tools 2.0 	- Music 

AND, before I forget, here are some thanks:

Martin (aka MCS), for tons of coding help
and
Chris (aka...um...George), for the midi in level 29 (Control Deck 17), some awesome 
graphics modifications (including a unique missile launcher pic :) ), and some encouragment


ALSO:

Save before the elevator at level 12. Trust me.
Save before the very end victory jump. You'll know - it'll be a familiar place.

AND:

How do you see yourself in fifty years time?
