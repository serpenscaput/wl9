WOLFPAK 2 (LowRes Version)
compiled by Sam Feichter (AstroCreep)

This is a compilation of many levels, all taken from vanilla Shareware and
Registered Wolfenstein 3D mods, created from the years of 1993-2002 or so.
This version has the hi-res textures and sprites, plus sprite fix taken out, for

authenticity purposes and for better compatibility with external graphics packs.



[Changes from originals]
Edited exits, as some caused errors due to the location of the triggers
Edited a few walls, for some reason some of these had unknown wall types, which is 
odd since none of these had source hacks.  The unknown walls would crash the game

Added Spear bosses, to add a bit of variety (IDs replace pacman ghosts)
Various fixes
Cows

Thanks to Brian (Schabbs) for hosting all these mods, and an extra thanks
to him for hosting all of my shitty mods for so long, it has officially been
17 years!
