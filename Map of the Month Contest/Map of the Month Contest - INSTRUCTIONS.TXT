For convenience, map one of the gamemaps in this month's package has the top and 
left rows of the map set to allow for default settings as follows:

Dark grey ceiling
Light grey floor
Shading off
Crosshair off
(and if you use teleporters, the above four settings stay the same)
Blocking tiles block EVERY enemy
ALL enemies can open locked doors
Health, ammo and treasures are all worth the usual default values (1st aid kit restores 
25 points health, dinner 10 points, ammo crate gives 25 ammo, etc etc)
Enemies cannot use health items
Player starts with a gun and 8 rounds of ammo
Weapons do NOT jam
Bosses ALL drop GOLD keys
Par time set to 10 minutes
In game messages have white text with grey shadow

NOTE: WolfMMC2C.exe allows for 700 static sprites per level, 200 enemies and 150 
objects on screen at once, and this is the exe we will be using for October.

When referring to "values" in the map, it means the number value assigned to a particular 
map wall texture. Please see the end of this text file to see a list of the first 
90 textures and their corresponding numbers that are used to create various effects 
in the map.



The mapdata.def file contains the numbers relating to other textures (these can be 
viewed from in Mapedit using the left/right arrow keys).


THE TOP ROW OF THE MAP - Coordinates [0,0] to [63,0]
====================================================


-------- GENERAL FEATURES --------

[0,0] = Song to be Played for your episode (Songs 0 to 36)
[1,0] = The Ceiling Colour for your Map (ie: Map choice Invalid "0" placed on this 
spot gets colour 0, black, from the games palette. See the image "Game Palette" to 
see the colours according to number) 
[2,0] = Floor Colour for your Map (same setup as Ceiling Colour) 
[3,0] = Starry Sky Toggle (0 = Off) 
NOTE: The ceiling colour would normally be black if you enable a starry sky, however 
other effects can be achieved eg: a crimson ceiling would create the effect of a 
blood red sky, and a red moon with this could be quite effective. Playing with the 
shading settings to create a red haze may add to the effect.
[4,0] = Moon Colour (only if 3,0 enables the starry sky) 1=White Moon, 2=Red, 3=Blue

[5,0] = Rain-Snow Toggle (2=Rain, 3=Snow, anything else = No Rain/Snow) 
[6,0] = Shading Off (0=Turn Off shading for this level only, 1 or anything else turns 
shading on) 
NOTE: If you have a starry sky, be careful if you choose to use shading, as it can 
cause the moon to look odd with "non shaded corners".
[7,0] = Crosshair Off (0=Turn Off crosshair for this level only, 1 or anything else 
turns crosshair on)
NOTE: The included file "Floor Colour and Ceiling chart.gif" makes choosing floor 
and ceiling colours easy! It shows a complete list of textures corresponding to which 
colours you can use for ceilings and floors!



-------- TELEPORTING --------

These values determine what colour ceiling/floor an area you teleport to will have. 
If you want the player to teleport to an outside area, then you can insert the value 
"0" in [10,0] so as a night sky will be displayed. Use the same values as in coords 
[1,0] - [4,0] if you don't want different ceiling/floor colours (for when you're 
teleporting within a room or area).

[8,0] = Ceiling Colour Warped 
[9,0] = Floor Colour Warped 
[10,0] = Starry Sky Warped 
[11,0] = Moon Colour Warped
[12,0] = Rain/Snow Warped
[13,0] = Shading Off Warped (0=Turn Off shading, 1 or anything else turns shading 
on) 
[14,0] = Crosshair Off Warped (0=Turn Off crosshair, 1 or anything else turns crosshair 
on)



-------- BLOCKING TILES --------

The map coordinates [15,0] - [26,0] determine which enemies can cross a blocking 
tile object.
A value of "0" = Not able to cross.
Any other value and they CAN cross.
[15,0] = Dogs Cross 
[16,0] = Guards Cross 
[17,0] = SS Cross 
[18,0] = Officer Cross 
[19,0] = Mutant Cross 
[20,0] = Hans Cross 
[21,0] = Gretel Cross 
[22,0] = Gift Cross 
[23,0] = Fat Cross 
[24,0] = Schabbs Cross 
[25,0] = Mecha Hitler Cross 
[26,0] = Real Hitler Cross 



-------- LOCKED DOOR SETTINGS --------

These allow for even more control... While you can use the Blocktile above to control 
enemy movement, you can now also use these 4 settings for even more control... 
Using these coordinates: 

[27,0] = Gold/Yellow Locked Doors 
[28,0] = Silver/Blue Locked Doors 
[29,0] = White Locked Doors 
[30,0] = Red Locked Doors 

You can now tell who can open the locked door by minimum enemy type... eg: if you 
don't want Guards or SS to open those doors, but you want the Officers or better 
to use the door... then you put the proper wall value on that coordinate...

The values are: 

1 = Guard, 2 = SS, 3 = Officer, 4 = Mutant, 5 = Hans, 6 = Gretel, 7 = Gift, 8 = FatFace, 
9 = Schabbs, 10 = MechaHitler, and 11 = Real Hitler 

Suppose you don't want Guards or SS to open a locked door of say Gold/Yellow. To 
achieve this place wall value 2 on map coordinate [27,0]. If the door is open anyone 
can come through and use it, but if it's closed, Guards and SS can't open it, whilst 
Officers, Mutants and all bosses can. 

Ghosts and Dogs can't open doors so there is no setting for them. If you want no-one 
to open a locked door, place a value of 12 and no enemy can open the locked door. 
A value of "0" means that all enemies can open that locked door type.



-------- HEALTH ITEM VALUES --------

[31,0] = First Aid Kit Value (For usual value of 25, you'd place texture no. 25 here 
<purple stone with blood>)
[32,0] = Food Plate Value (For usual value of 10, you'd place texture no. 10 here 
<wood panel with eagle>)
[33,0] = Dog Food Value (For usual value of 4, you'd place texture no. 4 here <grey 
stone with Hitler pic>)
[34,0] = Gibs Value (For usual value of 1, you'd place texture no. 1 here <grey stone>)




-------- AMMO/WEAPON VALUES --------

[35,0] = AmmoBox Value (For usual value of 25, you'd place texture no. 25 here <purple 
stone with blood>)
[36,0] = Full Clip Value (For usual value of 8, you'd place texture no. 8 here <blue 
stone>)
[37,0] = Used Clip Value (For usual value of 4, you'd place texture no. 4 here <grey 
stone with Hitler pic>)
[38,0] = Ammo for Weapon Pickup (For value of say 6, you'd place texture no. 6 here 
<grey stone with eagle>)



-------- ENEMY HEALTH --------

[39,0] = Enemies using health items (0 = Enemies can't pick up Health items, 1 or 
higher = Enemies can pick up Health items if they need it)



-------- BONUS ITEM POINT VALUES --------

IMPORTANT NOTE: All these values are multiplied by 100.
[40,0] = 1Up Bonus Value (For say a 1500 point bonus, you'd place texture no 15 here 
<steel panel>)
[41,0] = Cross Value (For usual value of 100, you'd place texture no. 1 here <grey 
stone>)
[42,0] = Chalice Value (For usual value of 500, you'd place texture no. 5 here <blue 
stone with empty cell>)
[43,0] = Chest/Bible Value (For usual value of 1000, you'd place texture no. 10 here 
<wood panel with eagle>)
[44,0] = Crown Value (For usual value of 5000, you'd place texture no. 50 here <elevator 
rails with swastika>)

So if, for example, you wished to make a treasure chest worth 3000 points, you'd 
merely place texture number 30 (brown cave with blood 1) at coordinate [43,0]



-------- IF PLAYER STARTS WITH ONLY A KNIFE --------

[48,0] = If set to 0, Guards Drop Ammo only. If set to 1 or other, Guards drop Pistol.

So you would use setting 0 if you want to place the gun the player has to find, and 
setting 1 or above if you want the player to get a gun from the first guard he kills.

NOTE: Coordinate [61,0] determines what weapon the player starts with - see below.




-------- IF PLAYER STARTS WITH A GUN --------

[49,0] = If set to 0, SS Drops Ammo only. If set to 1 or better, SS drops the Machinegun.

So you would use setting 0 if you want to place the machinegun the player has to 
find, and setting 1 or above if you want the player to get a gun from the first SS 
he kills.



-------- WEAPON JAMMING --------

[50,0] Weapons jamming (0 = Disable Weapon Jam, 1 = Enable Weapon Jam)
[51,0] If Weapon Jamming is Enabled, 0 = Weapon jams momentarily then works again, 
1 = weapon is lost if it jams



-------- WHAT THE BOSSES DROP --------

[54,0] = Hans Drop Value
[55,0] = Gretel Drop Value
[56,0] = Giftmacher Drop Value 
[57,0] = Fatface Drop Value
[58,0] = Schabbs Drop Value
[59,0] = Mecha Hitler Drop Value
[60,0] = Real Hitler Drop Value
 
Drop Values (0= drop nothing?, 1=Gold key, 2=Silver key, 3=White key, 4=Red key, 
5=Master key, 6=1up)



-------- OTHER VARIABLES --------

[61,0] = Starting Weapon (0 = Player will start with Knife, 1 or above = Players 
starts with gun and 8 rounds)
NOTE: If you put texture number 0 (invalid/blank) at coordinate [63,63], then you 
retain the weapons and ammo you've accumulated for the start of the next level (for 
use if this package is used as the base for a mod)
[62,0] = Par time Minutes (texture 1 = 1 min, 2 = 2 min, etc)
[63,0] = Par time Seconds (texture 0 = 0 secs, 1 = 15secs, 2 = 30secs, 3 = 45secs)


So if you wanted a par time of 4 minutes and 30 seconds, you'd enter texture number 
4 in [62,0] and 2 in [63,0].



THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MAP - Coordinates [0,1] to [0,63]
====================================================== 

[0,1] = Red Shading Level 
[0,2] = Green Shading Level 
[0,3] = Blue Shading Level 
[0,4] = Fog Level (0 = No fog, 1 = fog on)
Remember, coordinates [6,0] and [13,0] along the top row of the map determine if 
a level has shading or not.

Now the Red, Green, Blue Levels can be adjusted for the shading using wall values 
just as you can for the other game settings. Ripper's Normal shading examples had 
the following values: 

Red = Green = Blue in all the settings 
And he used 3 different values for those settings.. 0, 10, & 15. Now you can play 
with them as you like to get the specific look that you want. One thing to remember 
though is that depending on the age and type of your monitor, the colours that you 
see may be different to someone elses machine. So play with them carefully.

[0,5] = Crosshair Colour (again using palette values - 0 to 15 are usual values, 
but you can use any colour from the wolfenstein palette) 
[0,6] = Shadow Colour for Messages 
[0,7] = Main Colour for Message 



-------- COORDINATE [63,63] --------

Just place A Blank or Undefined (0) walltile on mapspot [63,63], and this will not 
reset the next level ie: you'll start the next level with everything you finish the 
current level with (THIS IS FOR MOD PURPOSES ONLY).



NEW GAME FEATURES
=================


-------- RANDOM ENEMIES --------

There are a new set of enemies called "Random". You can place these in a level just 
as any normal enemy, except exactly which enemy appears here in the level will be 
a random thing. It will spawn a Random enemy type based on truely random numbers. 
The odds are as follows: 

3 in 14 that nothing will spawn 
2 in 14 that an officer will spawn 
1 in 14 that a mutant will spawn 
3 in 14 that an SS will spawn 
2 in 14 that a dog will spawn 
3 in 14 that a guard will spawn 

So by using those Random Spawn points your level will vary from play to play and 
so on. It shouldn't play the same each time that it is played because it's based 
on random numbers (and I randomized the case statements to make sure that it too 
was random).



-------- PUSHABLE OBJECTS --------

If you place floor value 145 under any object sprite, it should make that particular 
object permanently pushable in that level (note that in Mapedit you must place the 
sprite on a proper floor value first, and then place the floor code 145 on top of 
it - Mapedit won't allow you to put an object on something it doesn't consider to 
be a legitimate floor value). You can push the object as often as you like through 
the level. You can even block doors open by pushing an impassable object into an 
open doorway - the door will stay open until you push the object out of the doorway.


You can use this feature to make barrels etc pushable (you could make columns and 
trees pushable too but this would look a little stupid). Barrels could be used to 
block an enemies access, or you could gain access to an area that's blocked off by 
barrels. Be mindful too that the player will have to be careful not to block themselves 
in an area if they push too many items up against an exit.

There's also potential here to make hard to find secret areas - the player may have 
to say push a few barrels around in a particular order just to access a secret pushwall. 
Mind you, most people aren't keen on frustratingly difficult puzzlers, so it's probably 
best not to make it too complex.
