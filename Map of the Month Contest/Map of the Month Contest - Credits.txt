Map of the Month Club Credits

Thanks to the work of  many people in the DieHard Wolfer Forums, making this program 

was possible.  They contributed ideas, graphics, and code.  They also contribute 
their time
and maps when they particpate in the Map of the Month process.  It would be a very 
long
list if I gave the names and what they each contributed, so for the credits here, 
I will be 
just listing the names.  

But, I guess the first person I should mention for the Wolf4SDL Source is Ripper. 
 It 
was his hard work that created the SDL source that not only works with Wolfenstein 
3d 
([c]1992 Id Software), but truely enhances some of the original features.  The biggest 

enhancement being the sound, where now you can actually hear many voices and sounds, 

all at the same time.  

Now the names of others who deserve credit (As they are known in the Forums):

MCS				AreYeP			Ripper
Adam Biser			Tricob				Chris
Tek-Zk				Hair Machine			Darkone
Dugtrio17			

So basically, that's it - except for me.. the one known as BrotherTank - that took

an original idea and some code, and gave you the chance to play, participate, and 
enjoy
the game that we all love. I hope you will join in the fun and want to submit your 
own 
levels for a little friendly competition, but if you don't that's fine too.  Either 
way, enjoy
what we have created for everyone and have some fun with this little game that just 

won't go away.  And don't be shy, join the forums if you aren't already a member!


Let the Games Begin!,

BrotherTank
