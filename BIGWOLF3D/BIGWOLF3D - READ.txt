BIG WOLF3D for LZWolf
LinuxWolf 2022

This is the BIG mod for Wolf3D. The world with which you are familiar is
scaled up by 2x in each axis. That translates to an increase in space to
play in by 300%! The player, enemies and items are not scaled.

The intent of this project is to allow the original game to be experienced
in a bigger environment. Roam around with fewer obstructions and fight
enemies at a distance.

For best results run this PK3 using the latest LZWolf version and select
either Wolfenstein 3D or Spear of Destiny. Other games are not supported.
