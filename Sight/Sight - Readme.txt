SIGHT

The third part in my series of small experimental mods, the other two being Stealth 
and Bound.

The objective on each level is to not be seen at all by anyone. Guards, dogs, mutants, 
bosses etc. When you're seen, you die.

Features:
-If you're noticed by an enemy, you'll die.
-You start with 5 lives instead of the usual 3 (I'm generous like that).
-Officers patrol faster.
-You will always get 100% kill count, so it is possible to complete this 100% (Andy_Nonymous' 
tutorial)
-Pushwalls go 8 spaces (Dugtrio17)

Tips: save often, when necessary use the run button and don't forget to peek around 
corners! ;)
