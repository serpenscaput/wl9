To use these levels, just replace the files MAPTEMP.WL1 and MAPHEAD.WL1
in your Wolf3D directory with the files in this archive, and then run
Wolf3D.  Be sure to keep a backup copy of the two files that you replaced
if you ever want to play the old levels again!

If there is no file called MAPTEMP.WL1 in your Wolf3D directory, but
there is a file called GAMEMAPS.WL1, then you have a later version of
Wolf3D (1.1 or 1.2).  You'll have to get the old version (1.0) to play
the levels.  (We may release these in version 1.1/1.2 format later, but
be warned that some of the interesting "effects" don't work in versions
after 1.0.)

These levels are quite hard.  You'll have to expect the unexpected in
order to win them.  For example, if you enter a seemingly empty room,
don't be surprised if guards suddenly start coming out of the walls
(literally!)

Here's one hint: all of the "bosses" except for one of the ones in 
level 9 can (and should) be avoided.

After you think you've completely explored all of the levels (but not
before!), look at them with MapEdit.  We guarantee you that you'll find
lots of hidden areas in places that you never even thought to look.
