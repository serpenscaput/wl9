Untitled Wolfenstein 3-D Hack
By Usotsuki and Bidi
Alpha Version 0.10

  * This hack installs over Wolfenstein 3-D 6-Episode Full Registered
    Version only, tested with 1.1, based on 1.2 maps, should also work
    with 1.4 - anyone who has 1.4 please contact me.
  * Please do not call or e-mail Apogee if something goes wrong, message
    notwithstanding.  Instead, e-mail <bidi@pinku.zzn.com> or
    <steve@dosius.zzn.com> and we will attempt to resolve the issue.
  * The levels changed are currently:

      * Episode 1, Levels 1-10

    Please note that some of the levels may not be winnable in Death
    Incarnate mode; this needs to be worked on.  This game is certainly
    winnable, however, on the easiest level!
  * Levels 3, 7 and a walled-off area of 6 are "Bloodbath Levels" - they
    feature a single floor and lots of enemies.  Watch your back and pick
    up all the ammo and food you can grab!
  * The secret level derives from the secret level in Episode 3 of the
    standard game.  Otherwise all the levels are designed from scratch.
  * The last level is similar, but not identical, to that of the original
    game.
  * ATTENTION LAMERS: WE WILL NOT SEND YOU COPIES OF THE REGISTERED VERSION
    OF WOLFENSTEIN 3-D.  YOU ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE IT ALREADY.
