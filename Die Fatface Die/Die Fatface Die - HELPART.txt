^c00You've spent hours watching the guards, waiting for a break in their patrols. When the opportunity hits, you slip into the old Spanish mission.




Your mission: Find General Fettgesicht and terminate him.

^c00You are legendary WWII hero William Joseph Blazkowicz, three-time medal of honor recipient and world-renowned nazi killer. Two weeks ago, you were stocking shelves at a grocery store in Midland, Texas. That's where they found you.
They laid it all out; Fatface's survival, his surrender to the western allies, his escape to Bolivia and his service eliminating dissidents for the government and generating revenue by any means necessary.

^c00Now, Fatface has become a liability. His appetites for food, cocaine and sex 
have scandalized the people and dramatically increased support for anti-government
guerrilla groups. The state department wants him gone before the situation 
deteriorates any further. 

That's where you come in.

^c00Desperate to maintain the element of surprise, the G-men smuggled you overland into the country. 
After a few close shaves,you finally arrived in Sacaba three days ago. 
Equipping you with a knife, pistol and MP-40 submachine gun, your handlers gave you the location of Fatface's 
compound and sent you merrily on your way. 
Captain Blazkowicz, you've got a gun and three floors of hell to get through.
Good luck!

^c7ePOWER PLAYER TIPS AND TRICKS
^c00 * Crates are a valuable source of ammo and healing items! Smash them open to get at the goodies inside!
	 * The chaingun is a powerful weapon but is prone to jamming. Conserve it only for when you need it most.
	 * Watch out for barrels of flammable solvent. These will explode when shot.  
     * It's the seventies. BJ isn't above a little recreational blow. Using the 
	   cocaine lying around can give you the little extra boost you need to survive.
