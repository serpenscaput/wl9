Once again, you stand over the body of General Erwin Fettgesicht. Somehow still breathing weakly despite the dozens

You return to the United States. While your exploits will remain classified for decades to come, the government 
sees fit to provide you a healthy stipend for services rendered. Although easily capable of retirement, you grow
weary with idleness and soon return to doing odd jobs and waiting for the next call....
