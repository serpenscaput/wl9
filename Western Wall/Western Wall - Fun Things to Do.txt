10 Fun things to do before you play the game . . .

1. Do a mental two-step.
2. Get your French homework out of the way. Ca va? (Ca va mal)
3. Stop playing Beyond Wolfenstein II: SE. Playing that and WWI at the same
	time gives you the ultimate addon: Beyond Western Wolfenstein: The
	game with POW's with flamethrowers, toilets that bark, and rocket
	launchers that fire trucks.
4. Read the manual.
5. Have a ready supply of Pepsi. I suggest those beer dispensing hats with
	Pepsi substituted for alcholic bevrages.
6. Fire up the CD player with your favorite Electric Light Orchestra CD.
7. Run a Norton AntiVirus scan to make sure your computer is bug free and
	will not crash in the middle of your game.
8. Check all files in your WWI directory and make sure they all work by
	testing them with an air pressure gague.
9. Disconnect your phone line so as not to be interrupted while playing.
10. Press the any key.

10 Fun things to do in the game . . .

1. Listen to the hottest hits on Hugh's Jukebox!
2. Clip into a room full of "sitting" guards and pluck 'em while they're
	enjoying a nice chat.
3. Take a screenshot of the truck and print it out. Suitable for framing.
4. Another thing to do with the truck, sit and stare at it. Look at the
	finish!
5. Kill everything with a knife, no damage flash in Godmode!
6. Hold down TAB+D for a crazy fun time!
7. Read my funny "Exit the game" messages.
8. Read the Credits page.
9. Play "Follow the leader" with the scientist on level 3.
10. Do the "Fireman Dance" (Fire the chaingun without stopping and spin
	violently in a circle.)

10 Fun things to do after you played the game . . .

1. Play it again.
2. Tell all your friends about it.
3. Drink some Pepsi.
4. Listen to Alanis Morissette for 32 straight hours and then take out your
	mental anguish on some AI! (artificaial intelligence)
5. Go cow tipping.
6. Try to improve your low self-esteem you stupid freak.
7. Play ASTROSTEIN.
8. Call all your friends at the asylum.
9. Shove a roll of duct tape up your nose.
10. Make a game that rivals mine so your spirits can be raised to the point
	where you think yourself invincible and then I relase WWI: PLATINUM
	VERSION with Night Vision, Light Shading, Fog, Friendly AI, and
	Exploding Haggen Daaz Ice Cream, and your dreams are crushed like
	sea fleece in a landslide.
