Spifferanous Heffner's Western Wall I - VERSION 1.0

Game type:  Free-Standing
Episode, Level #: One large episode, 29 levels and a secret level
Single player:  Yes
Difficulty settings:  1-4.
New Sounds:  Yes
New Graphics:  Yes
New Music:  Yes (Sort of)

*Construction*
--------------

Base:  29 levels split up into various "units" with thier own theme and 
	goal. This is explained further in. The Manual.
Editor(s) used: 
	Graphics	-	Wolfedit, Paint Shop Pro 4, Wintex, FloEdit
	Levels		-	WolfMap (Yeah, the really old one), Mapedit
	Sound		-	Wolfaud, Wolfsnd, Goldwave, Wintex
	Code		-	Borland C++ Turbo Compiler (v 3.0)
Build time:  About a year and a half. Coding took a long time, my VSWAP 
		crashed 3 times, maps had errors, and hard drive crashes
		drug this project out but it's worth it.
Known bugs:  Dissappearing objects error in places near trucks. This is
		a necessity since the truck can only be viewed from 3 
		angles at once. Trees and shrubs are grouped heavily to
		obscure the side that cannot be viewed. 
	     If you pick up a chaingun before any of the shell weapons
             	and you run out of bullets, picking up a shell weapon will
	     	not do anything. You will be stuck with the knife. I'm working
	     	on fixing this.
	     If your health is at 97% or something like that and you pick up 
		a medkit, your health will shoot up to 115%. This is a minor 
		inconvenience on my part.

* Hugh's Jukebox - Yeah I know, it's Rob's but it's mine for this game. 
One night while I was drinking Pepsi I figured I'd add the jukebox to the
main menu. So I did. There's 3 lists of songs, ones that I picked, that
range from songs in the game like "Ulitmate Challenge" to stuff like "Hitler
Waltz." Who's Hugh? Hugh's me. You know, Heffner? Hugh Heffner? Owner of
Playboy. Ah forget it.

** Ok here's the deal: Syringes boost your health up past 100 to 115, BUT if
your health is at 98 and you pick up a first aid kit, it will be skyrocketed
up to 115. I'll figure it out one day.

*** "Sitting" Guard - This is a pretty cool feature. Hamez and I were 
conferring, conference-ing one day when he was trying to make the guards
drop something when they go into Attack Mode. He figured it out at the same
time I did but his compiler crashed and I did it first. So now all the guards
are sitting when you first see them, when they see you they stand up and 
leave their chairs behind.

**** The Scientist - What's the deal with this guy? You meet him on the 3rd
level. ON LEVEL 3 HE MUST BE KILLED!!!!!! SCIENTISTS ON LEVEL 3 DROP THE
IRON KEY!!!! THIS GOES ONLY FOR LEVEL 3!!!!! Any other time you see him you
can kill him but your score gets reduced 200 points every time. He won't notice 

you unless you get in his way. All he does is yell at you. These guys will become 

more plentiful in the Lab Unit of the game. They also drop syringes.

***** New Door Textures - No, I just didn't change the picture. I know some 
of you will ask that. Anyway, I figured it would be easy to do so I fiddled 
around in WL_DRAW and figured it out. 

THEN I READ PROJECT TOTENGRABER'S README AND FOUND OUT HE EXPLAINS IT IN 
THERE AND IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME A MINUTE'S WORK!!!!! 

****** The TRUCK - Yes boys and girls, hailed by Nate and Hamez alike, the
TRUCK is a pretty damn cool collection of wall patterns. This mother is
unique to my game so if I see it in one of your addons, you will be hacked,
cracked, and your hard drive will be fired into the stratosphere.

Anyway, that's about all I can say for this chapter. Now on to bigger things.

*Cheating*
----------

You wimp. Ok, here's all the cheats in my game:

IDKFA - Hold all these keys down at once to get keys, guns, ammo, and health.
MLS - Same as above but with godmode!
BAT - Displays a funny message

Debugging keys work the same way and have the same ALT, SHIFT, BACKSPACE uh,
initiator I guess you could call it. I forget the correct term. Here are
the cheats:

TAB+D - Test debug key. Just to see if I could make the new cheats do what
	I want.
TAB+G - Godmode
TAB+H - Hurt Yourself
TAB+I - Guns, points, ammo, health
TAB+K - All keys cheat
TAB+N - No clipping mode
TAB+P - Pause
TAB+T - View the pics and sounds
TAB+W - Level warp

*Credits, Disclaimers, and Such*
--------------------------------

DON'T USE THIS GAME AS A BASE FOR YOUR OWN!!!! I WORKED TOO DAMN HARD ON THIS
AND SUFFERED THROUGH VARIOUS VSWAP CRASHES!!!! AND IF I EVER SEE MY TRUCK IN
YOUR ADDON, I DON'T CARE HOW I DO IT, I'LL FIND YOU AND FORCE YOUR MONITOR
UP YOUR NOSE AND PLAY DIABLO WHILE LOOKING IN YOUR EAR!!!!
