             STAR FLEET BBS'S 2 NEW WOLFENSTEIN GAME UPGRADES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT NEW FILES....
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
these 2 files will give you 2 new games game 1 and 2, the name of the games
will be still the same but the levels will be difrent, the whole look,
the plans of each floor will be totally dirfent, difrent bad guys!
secrets passages will be difrent also,they will not be in the same places.
because the whole layout of each floor on game 1 & 2 will be totall difrent.
it took me some time to change the 2 games. i'm working on changing the
rest of the games, so look out for those..

INSTRUCTIONS....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok all you have to do is copy these 2 files in your wolf directory!
This upgrade will only work if you have all 6 wolfeinstein games
meaning you have to have a vswap.wl6 file in your directory for this to
work, also you must have the registered version for the upgrade to work.
also make sure you have a copy of the original game because game 1
and games 2 will be difrent, and you will not be able to get the original
game 1 and 2 back until you replace the 2 files i gave you with the original
files...


Have fun and good luck,some levels will be harder.....
