Storyline:
Germany, Autumn 1942. As the German Army continues it's advance deep
into Soviet territories and the Ukraine, German U-boats have started
the blockade of Britain. Lots of convoys are intercepted by Germans and
are taken over or destroyed. Britain seems to get starved out. 
The Allied High Command has no retort; more and more British
freighters get destroyed by German U-boats. The Gestapo
(Geheime Staats-Polizei, Secret Police of State) is now patrolling
German occupied countries with even more effective escorts,
inflicting heavy losses on the Allies. Nevertheless, the Allied
High Command orders more and more soldiers, with even lower ages,
into battle from their ports in various countries.

The battle for control of the war is turning against the Allies.

Many Allied operations have failed due to many German spies in the Allied
Command and Allied Army. It seems that the Germans have infiltrated MI6.
The Germans know every move the Allies make.

However, the Allies have received word of a secret operation going on in
a mountainious region in the mountains of Bavaria. This region is chosen
strategically because of the weather conditions in those mountains. It
always snows and the dawn comes at 1:00 PM. This means that nobody can
see that there's anybody here. In the direct neighbourhood of an
abandoned German airfield, Germans have made a network of various
bunkers and castles located in the mountains so that there will be a
pretty fast transport-possibility between the bunkers and castles.
The main installation of the network is a fortress called Festung Adler.
This castle, originally home of many German monarchs, was restorated by
the Third Reich's official architect (Albert Speer) and converted to fortress.
It's nickname is "The Eagle's Nest". It's well named, because you have to
be an eagle to reach it. It lies at 3000 meters above sea-level. There's
no connection with the valley below it, making it the perfect location for
secret operations as it is impregnable. Those who tried to get atop didn't
return. The Allies are uncertain if this was accomplished by the freezing
temperature or any Nazi patrols.

The castles within the network are interconnected by a system of tunnels. Originally 
officiated as airstrike cover, these tunnels connect the various castles with each other. 
To eliminate any spies, the entrances of these tunnels are protected by various SS and 
Gestapo. To get through these slimey, gooey tunnels, you'll need a few bullets and a 
good memory. Various parts of the tunnels look equal, but they are NOT.

The rumored operation currently running is called Aufräumung(literally,
Cleaning Mission), led by the Gestapo's main leader, Werner Gelassen, and
the Fuhrer himself. This mission is going to be the biggest one yet. All
Nazi weapons will be used for this mission, including a brand-new
technique manufactured by a mysterious scientist by the name of
Jurgen Schabbs. This man, who is not a Nazi but a scientist who gets
orders of Hitler, has found a way to make dead soldiers live again.
This option means that, if it would be used, the Third Reich will
be unstoppable and unbeatable. However, the soldiers who are revived
do have one little bug in their mechanical brain: they only obey Schabbs.

The experiments of Schabbs are held inside the walls of Festung Adler. No
one can possibly enter it because of the Gestapo controlling each nook and
cranny of the neighbourhood areas and the SS stationed at every entrance
possible. However, there's one abandoned castle in the neighbourhood of the
network. This castle called Hasselhoff, was used at the beginning of the
network-laying, but wasn't that strategical because of the many endless
corridors leading to nowhere. In the basement of that castle is a small
weapon-storage area with only Hitlerjugend-soldiers on duty. The entrance
to this castle is quite hard to find, but crude maps drawn by spies will
give you the location of it. 

Realising that this is the perfect way to get inside Cleaning Mission-network,
Allied High Command orders you to get in. Your mission includes:

A. The destruction of Cleaning Mission-Network;
B. The elimination of Schabbs dead minions;
C. The liquidation of Schabbs, Gelassen and perhaps the Fuhrer himself.

And in case you run into other high-ranked officers, liquidate them too.
Be warned that only points A,B and C are neccessary, so don't do anything
stupid. Fight hard in there! Good luck soldier. You'll need it.
Description of the game's levels

The game's levels are divided up in "units", groups of levels with a certain
theme. All the levels in an unit have something to do with each other. 
You don't have to do anything special to end an unit, by the way.

Levels 1-5: Castle Hasselhoff

You begin your mission in an old Prussian castle called Hasselhoff. It is the first 
installation in the network, mainly used for storage of Schabbs' equipment. On floor 5 a 
boss named Werner Gelassen is waiting for you. He is a Gestapo general with the duty of 
protecting the network behind the castle.

Level 6: Tunnel 1

Levels 7-10: Festung Adler

You finally reached "The Eagle's Nest". It lies atop of a mountain which is unaccessable from 
the valley below. This stronghold belonged to German monarchs for centuries, but now the Fuhrer 
has stamped it as the main installation for the operation. It's your task to run enough amok 
here so the stronghold will need a renovation. Be careful, this castle is heavily guarded! On 
floor 10 you'll face the Ubermutant, Schabbs' biggest and boldest mutant. Be careful!

Level 11: Tunnel 2

Levels 12-15: Felsendamm Dungeon

The cold wind howls in your ears when you enter the dungeon system Felsendamm, part of Festung 
Adler. Felsendamm, built in 1643, officiates as dungeon for captured spies. While being starved 
and tortured, the Gestapo pulls the info out of them. No wonder this place smells like death: 
blood, sweat and tears are part of the main smell. These cold, damp floors are protected by 
guards and SS. It also covers the Luftburg-bunker, the next installation of the network. The 
closer you get to the end, the less human guards you will encounter...

Level 16: Tunnel 3

Levels 17-20: Luftburg-bunker

When you climb out of the tunnel, you have reached Schabbs' laboratories. Here you'll face the 
dreaded mutant scum of Schabbs at last. Watch what you are shooting - there are many unarmed 
mutants too! After painstakingly crawling through the bunker, you will reach Schabbs.

Level 21: Contemporary Insanity
Level 22: Tommy's Tailor

In case you'll ever find the secret elevator leading to these levels, good luck!
