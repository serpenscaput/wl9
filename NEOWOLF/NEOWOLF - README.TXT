	Here's 4 new levels of Wolfenstein 3-D to play that I put together 
using MAPEDIT.  They are the first 4 levels of Episode 1, Escape From
Wolfenstein.  Also included are modified versions of MAPHEAD.WL6, 
GAMEMAPS.WL6, and VSWAP.WL6 that contains some new wall graphics, objects and
bloodier death scenes so be sure to save your old versions first or you'll 
have to reinstall them from the original disks later.
	The first level is a GREATLY modified version of level 1 just to give
you some reference points to go by.  The other 3 are built from scratch and 
are quite large.  There are no annoying mazes to navigate (yay!) and all 
secret doors are CLEARLY marked (because I HATE having to push every inch of
every wall just to get 100% on the secrets).
	Have fun!
