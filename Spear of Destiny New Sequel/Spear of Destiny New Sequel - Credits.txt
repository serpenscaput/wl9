Spear of Destiny: New Sequel

This mod is based on Megabyte's SOD Mappack. It brings 21 levels, music from Blake 
Stone, and some minor graphic changes. Most of the levels are from Megabyte's mappack, 
but they have been slightly modified. The Blake Stone music is arranged on dungeon 
and castle levels. The mod retains the original Spear of Destiny feel.
