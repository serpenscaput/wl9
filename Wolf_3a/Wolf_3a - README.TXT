10/31/93

Hello again to all you Wolf-3D fans out there!

Now, I have modified levels 1, 2 & 3 just slightly (!) to make them a
little more difficult (actually, a lot more difficult).  Even I
have trouble getting through on Death Incarnate.  You may find a surprise 
or two on all other levels except 10.  I won't mention that there may be
MORE than two surprises on level 9 (heh-heh).

First of all, thanks again to Apogee Software for a great game...

Thanks again to Bill Kirby who made a great map editor...

Now, the hints:

1) Look for secret doors
2) Use tactical maneuvering when in a battle
3) Try to remain calm when you enter the mazes and can't get out!
(you can with just a liiiiiiiiiiiitle patience).  You MUST go through the
mazes to get everything and to get out (sorry!).
4) Only levels 1, 2, & 3 (9?) have been altered, but they should keep you
busy, try to find everything
5) Yes, it's levels 1, 2, & 3 (9?) but you WILL have trouble recognizing
them
6) Levels 4-10 (not 9?) are normal and I will modify them 1 at a time in
the future
7) Keep track of extra health and ammo, you ARE going to need it.
8) The game is not quite perfect, I need some more hints from
others who have done this (I'm getting better though!).
9) Check those corners!!!!!!!
10) There are LOTS of goodies!!!!
11) Play on Death Incarnate; no wimps, please!
12) There are some new surprises on levels 1 & 2! (probably not on 9!)
13) Levels 1 & 2 have changed slightly and play differently (10/31/93).
14) GOOD LUCK!!! heh-heh-heh!!!
15) Does NOT work on version 1.4 - try to get an earlier version from a BBS.

Let me know what your scores are and what kind of problems you
seem to encounter.  This is a fun game and this should keep it
interesting.  Of course, there is no charge since the game
belongs to Apogee.  Happy gaming!
