Wolfenstein Reloaded Final Hotfix 3

Fixes the following issues:

- General alarm on non-stealth maps caused gameover
- Some boss sounds could still be silenced, not anymore
- Some bosses had incorrect firing sounds
- One typo in Fatface's introduction

Added stuff:

- More ammo to second episode (Requested)
- Some, not so important, messages

Notes:

- Old savegames won't work
- Old configs will work

Deepest apologies for all the fans out there, this is the third patch
to the version that was supposed to be the final version. There will be
no more patches, this is the last and final patch. Your old savegames are
not compatible with this code, also unlocks will work.

Also those that have difficulties with the second episode, the ammo situation will 
be
a lot better on the following episodes. Second episode was supposed to be difficult.


This will be the last update to this project, so you may consider this the final 
version
that it was supposed to be three patches ago. We are really sorry about this, but 
it was
absolutely necessary.
