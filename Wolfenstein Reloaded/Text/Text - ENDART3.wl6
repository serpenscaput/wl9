^C7d You Won!

^C00 Hitlers body collapses to the ground after a tough firefight. You kick his head 
away and prepare yourself to what's next. Next target is Giftmacher's chemical factory 
just outside Berlin. Sneaking isn't necessary anymore because you know that nazis 
are looking for you according to those wanted posters you saw in Berlin streets. 
French resistance provided you with some weapons so it's time for an assault. Nazis 
won't know what hit them before it's too late...
