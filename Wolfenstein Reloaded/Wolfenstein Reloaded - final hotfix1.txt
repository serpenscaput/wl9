Wolfenstein Reloaded Final Hotfix 1

Fixes the following issues:

- Barracks alert bug
- Reactor core sound
- Cleaned difficulty pictures (red pixels)
- Fixed the "And remember..." screen
- Bosses now give the 15k bonus
- Hopefully cleared more "Out of memory" issues
- Gave the M1Garand a facelift

Shouldn't interfere with old savegames,
but just in case, keep the old exe backed up.

- KFH Games
