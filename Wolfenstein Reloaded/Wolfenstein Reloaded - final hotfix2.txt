Wolfenstein Reloaded Final Hotfix 2

Fixes the following issues:

- Mysterious DosBox suicide heal bug fixed
- Now you can't stop custom bosses from speaking their mouth clean
- Made episode 2 Grand Hall map a little easier on death incarnate skill
- Fixed a few menu pic backgrounds
- Fixed incorrect mapnames when game is loaded from a savegame that is on a different 
map than current
- Ambushing guards now don't "find dead guards" when they start chasing
- Made everything demo playback compatible
- Hopefully eliminated "Walk: Bad dir" bugs (Which Megabyte reported once)
- Fixed door jams
- Fixed old config compatibility

Added stuff:

- Suicide message
- Recorded 3 demos (Supports 9 demos, without additional source code changes)

Notes:

- Old savegames do not work
- Old configs work, unlike I stated in diehardwolfers forum (Added compatibility 
code)

We know, this is the second patch to a version that was supposed to be final, we 
are sorry.
