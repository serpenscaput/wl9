The Inner Circle: SDL Version

The original 2 level Spear demo set was made by Philipp Luy (NeXuS). 


Running in DOS hints:

The Dos exe has been included too but if this is used then delete the supplied config.sdm 
file before playing. 

Also, saved games made with the Dos version are not compatible with those made with 
SDL.
