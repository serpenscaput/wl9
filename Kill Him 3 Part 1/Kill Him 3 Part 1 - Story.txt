 KillHim 3 part 1 - Crap

BJ: God damn I'm stuck in here, the elevator is damaged.

HQ: BJ, Your only way out is to go back to the other Elevator.. I just heard that 
the backup has arrived, there are flying ghosts of the soldiers you killed. I heard 
too that there are strange grey mutants in human form.

Here are the Ranks of the backup:

Battalion 1 - Strong SS Soldiers [ grey ]
Battalion 2 - Battlefield Soldiers [ grey ]
Battalion 3 - Guards [ green ]

BJ: Argggg.. I can't.

HQ: You must go in one time through it, it's the only way.. Otherwise you will be 
killed, Just shoot the first ghost in your face and run to the door, I didn't get 
any more information so you must find out, I'll call you later. Success.



PLEASE NOTE: This version is part one of the 'KillHim 3' game and has just one playable 
level. A version with more levels will be issued later.


INSTALL: To play this game you will need the full version of 'Spear Of Destiny'. 
Firstly, unzip the full version 'Spear Of Destiny' files into a folder called (say) 
'KillHim 3 part 1'. Then add the files from 'KillHim3Part1.zip', overwriting any 
original files.
