------Dr. Bob's Freakenstein: The Road to Insanity------

	I got the idea from the game Chokage. In that 
game, all the brown guards walk upside down and I
thought that ruled. I built upon that idea and lo and
behold, we get Freakenstein.
	Instead of just the brown guards being upside
down, EVERYTHING is. Including all other guards, static
objects and even wall patterns. You are also upside 
down. It's just wild.
	All the levels are the same, just upside down.
It's pretty cool. I was even thinking about reversing
all the sounds and music but my friend advised me that 
that might be going too far.
	I hope you enjoy Freakenstein.
