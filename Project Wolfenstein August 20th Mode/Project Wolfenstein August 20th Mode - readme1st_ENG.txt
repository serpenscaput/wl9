A Wolfenstein 3D - Project: Wolfenstein v2.0 August 20th mode mod created by Officer-Michael 
John

-------------------------------------------------
Mod type: Stand-alone, Mappack with new code and many GFX changes.
Engine: Wolf4SDL
Features: 
- New GFX, SFX
- 10 new level (Note: Some of them are now more complex compared to the original 
release)
- Completely rewriten source code.
- New musics.
-------------------------------------------------

This is an updated version of my Project: Wolfenstein, which includes some changes 
to the maps (as mentioned earlier), and a brand new Wolf4SDL.exe. Source code changes 
includes:
- Maximum amount of Ammo is now 999 
- A new weapon
- New ceiling colours
- SS always drops machine gun
- Boss enemies' routines are rewriten
- 4 keys 

The v2.0 also contains a second episode, titled "Unused Maps (DOS)". This small episode 
contains some maps, that are made for the original DOS version, but scrapped from 
the final SDL release. (You will most likely find out, why...)

How to install?

- Create an empty folder anywhere on your hard disk, and extract the content of the 
PrjWolf2_0.zip to there.

How to play?

- Start game with Wolf4SDL.exe.

Tools i've used to create this mod:

- ChaosEdit: Editing GFX, sounds, maps.
- Dev-Cpp: Compiling the code for the SDL version.
- Borland 3.1.: Compiling the code for the Early DOS version (It's never released 
trough).
- WDC: Replacing musics and AdLib sounds.


I hope you like this! :)
