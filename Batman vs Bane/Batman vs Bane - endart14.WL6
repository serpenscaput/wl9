^C7d Killer Croc

^C00 Waylon Jones aka Killer Croc was born with a form of atavism that imparted him 
with reptilian traits. The sewers are his home, and he does not like it when Batman 
sets foot on 'his property'.

^C7d Location

^C00 You are close, but not in the asylum yet. The sewer exit leads you to the parking 
area of the employees of the asylum. From what you can hear, there is definitely 
a riot going on. Be prepared!
