Operation Body Count

   This graphics add-on was hacked from Operation Body Count (demo). I also
borrowed the doors from Duke Does Deutschland.
   The game uses the Wolfenstein 3-D engine, so it was familiar enough for me 
to find and extract the graphics and sound data.
   This add-on is designed to work with the shareware version 1.4 of Wolf.
It worked fine on my system, and you should have no problems. However,
I cannot bear any responsibility for anything that might go wrong, so
use this add-on at your own risk.
   Thanks to id, Apogee and Capstone for the game design and Blackadder 
(Barneystein) and Loren G. Dobert (DOOMenstein) for inspiration.

                                        Have Fun!
