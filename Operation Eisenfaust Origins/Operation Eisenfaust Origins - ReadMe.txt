Operation Eisenfaust: Origins
=========================

Thanks for playing Operation Eisenfaust: Origins, a revolutionary add-on for Wolfenstein 
3D. 
The following pages will introduce you to the story and many new features of this 
project, 
as well as describing the mission at hand. Good luck and enjoy!
===================

Story:

You are BJ Blazkowicz

The Nazi's were slowly but surely losing the war, but rumours had it that the
Nazi's were working on one final all or nothing tactic. A camp had been set up,
but what had been taking place at that camp was unknown at the time. Infamous
Nazi doctors had been seen entering the camp, but the how and why were still a
mystery. 

A spy hardly ever gets a break, and the same goes for BJ. You had hooked up
with the Underground after defeating Hans Grosse, where you were informed about
Dr. Schabbs and his 'Operation Eisenfaust'. The camp was linked to the
operation; it was rumoured that it was here that the experiments took place.
You were sent in for investigation.

But something went wrong and you were caught. You got confirmation that
experiments had been taking place, for you were to become a test subject very
soon...

=============================
Weapons:

1. Knife
Unlimited ammo, close range weapon. Has "silent powerkill from behind" alt-attack 
feature.

2. Luger handgun
Handgun. As it sounds. Fires single shots in relatively slow fire rate.
Reloads clip after 8 shots.
Can be manually reloaded at any time by pressing "R"

3. MP40
Has a very affecting rate of fire, yet needs reloading after 32 bullets.
Can be manually reloaded at any time by pressing "R"

4. Chaingun
Has VERY high rate of fire, though lack accuracy.

It takes sometime to wind up and wind down so it's only really effective against 
bad guys you know are there before you go round the corner.

5. Gewehr 41 Sniper Rifle
Has large accuracy, especially over large distances.
But needs round loading after each shot, and longer manual reloading after 4 rounds.

Press "X" to zoom in and press "X" again to zoom out. Long "kewdown" leads to even 
stronger zoom.

Can be manually reloaded at any time by pressing "R".

6. Wire Cutters. When picked up, can be used to cut low fences - activation as alternative 
weapon to knife - under the same number spot.
Can be used to cut communication lines.
Don't pass from level to level.

7. Secret weapon. Not much can be said about it at this point. Has "X" as alt-fire.



Inventory:

1. Press "backspace" to use the medkits.

2. Warm coat - when found will give you 100 points of protection from freezer room 
on that level.
