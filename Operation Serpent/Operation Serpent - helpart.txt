^C67Thank you for downloading Operation Serpent First Encounter, an incredible new 
mod for the ECWolf source port. While my tech demo had shown some of the capabilities 
of the engine, Operation Serpent is far more ambitious and shows a glimpse of the 
engine's true potential.
^P
^G16 16 [OSMAP]
^C[Green]THE STORY

^C67The year is 1989. Since its independence in 1976, the Central American republic 
of San Salvacion had been in the grip of civil war, but now the war has ended with 
the ascendancy of the "Partido de Liberacion Nacional" (PLN).

The PLN are a militarist, quasi-fascist party representing the interests of the while 
"creole"
^P
^G16 16 [COATARM1]
^C[Green]THE STORY

^C67elite of the country, led by the dictator Enrique Cruz. They rose to power on 
platform of xenophobic paranoia and racial hatred, and by now have almost absolute 
power within the country. However, their aggressive policies are not restricted to 
mere words.

On December 13, 1988, the PLN passed the "Revolutionary Defense and Relocation Act", 
eliminating

^P
^G16 16 [OSBONES]
^C[Green]THE STORY
^C67the remaining human rights of the so-called "inferior races" of the country, 
defined as anyone who is not a white ethnic Spaniard.

The PLN immediately began widespread and brutal repressions against blacks, Indians, 
and mestizos, up to and including rounding them up and
^P
^C[GREEN]THE STORY

^C67deporting them to camps or plantations for use as slave labor. If the potential 
for a repeat of the Holocaust in the Americas wasn't alarming enough, it is believed 
that infamous Nazi war criminal Dr. Johann Moerder, has been hiding in the country. 
Moerder has been implicated in heinous medical experiments conducted at the Chelmno 
concentration camp in 1944.

Intelligence has it that Dr. Moerder 

^P
^G16 16 [OSDNA]
^C[Green]THE STORY
^C67is working with President Cruz and numerous other scientists on new medical experiments 
related to genetic and cybernetic modification of primates. At first the experiments 
were done on native monkeys and apes imported from Africa, but now it is believed 
that prisoners from the camps are being shipped to laboratories affiliated with Dr. 
Moerder for experimentation, as well as civilians abducted from Mexico.
^P
^G16 16 [OSUN]
^C[Green]THE STORY
^C67The Mexican government brought evidence of the Cruz's crimes before the United 
Nations Security Council in December 1988, showing images and written accounts of 
atrocities taking place in San Salvacion. However, the United States had lucrative 
arms deals and trade agreements with San Salvacion, and members of the Reagan cabinet 
had ties to government and business leaders in the country.
^P
^C[Green]THE STORY

^C67After nine days of debate and deliberation, the United States vetoed a UN security 
council resolution authorizing the use of force in San Salvacion. There would be 
no international intervention. Mexico then reached out to an armed antifa organization, 
Accion Antifascista Mundial. Declared terrorists by many in the First World, AAM 
uses armed resistance to subvert and destroy fascist regimes wherever they may spring 
up.
^P
^C[Green]THE STORY

^C67On March 13, 1989, the organization, with Mexican funding and support, commenced 
a secret operation known as ^C[Green]Operation Serpent. ^C67You are Agent Maria Cortez, 
an experienced AAM operative tasked with conducting Operation Serpent. You will be 
dropped into San Salvacion by helicopter to investigate the activities of the PLN 
and Dr. Morder and put a stop to them, by any means necessary.
^P
^C[Green]THE STORY

^C67Secrecy is paramount. You will be sent in with an Austrian Glock 17 pistol to 
avoid connection with the Mexican government; all other weapons must be procured 
on site from the enemy. If you are captured, Mexico will disavow any knowledge of 
you or your activities.

While history may bever record your struggle, hundreds of thousands of innocent people 
will owe their lives to you if you succeed. Good luck.
^P
^C[GREEN]FEATURES
^C67* Enormous 180x180 levels--eight times the size of Wolfenstein 3-D levels!
* 7 devastating new weapons.
* A variety of powerful enemies, including towering monsters.
* Deadly traps and environmental hazards, such as spikes, land mines, and lava.
* Completely new palette for a unique look and feel.
* Pulse-pounding heavy metal soundtrack.
* Weapon bobbing, like in Doom.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^C67Your objective in Operation Serpent First Encounter is to make your way across 
the country of San Salvacion to find Dr. Moerder's hidden laboratory and eliminate 
him and his creations.

Operation Serpent First Encounter consists of six levels plus one secret level. In 
each level you must navigate the area, obtain the keycards needed to open locked 
doors, and defeat your enemies to progress.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 40 [OSBAR]


^c67 The ^c[GREEN]status bar ^c67at the bottom of the screen provides critical information 
during gameplay. 

The first indicator shows the current area you are in, from 1-6 (or 0 for the secret 
level).

The next one shows your current score. You gain score by defeating
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 40 [OSBAR]


^c67enemies, collecting treasure, and gaining end-level bonuses. Score represents 
how thoroughly you have explored the game.

^c67The lives indicator shows your remaining extra lives. You lose a life every time 
you die, and if you die with zero extra lives, it's game over.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 40 [OSBAR]


^c67The mugshot provides a quick visual indicator of Agent Cortez's health. Her face 
becomes bloodier as she takes damage.

^c67The health indicator is more precise, and shows health as a numerical value. 
Agent Cortez starts with 100 health and dies if her health reaches zero.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 40 [OSBAR]


^c67The next indicator shows the ammunition for your current weapon. Different weapons 
use different types of ammo, and the knife uses none at all.

After that comes the key bar. It displays which keys you have collected via small 
colored icons.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 40 [OSBAR]


^c67The rightmost indicator shows an image of your current weapon and its hotkey 
number. You will collect seven different weapons over the course of the game.

You will receive an extra life for every 40,000 points you earn. A good player will 
be able to complete the game with millions of points.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 16 [OSSKILL]





^c67When you begin the game, you will have the choice of four skill levels. Operation 
Serpent is intended to be slightly easier than Wolfenstein overall. Skill level affects 
enemy numbers and strength.

^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 16 [OSSKILL]

^c[GREEN]Very Easy ^c67difficulty is for players who just want to experience the 
game without being challenged much. Enemy damage is greatly reduced. This setting 
is not representative of the game's true balance.

^c[GREEN]Easy ^c67 difficulty is forgiving, but still provides a challenge. Enemies 
are full strength, but appear in lower numbers.

^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 16 [OSSKILL]

^c[GREEN]Medium ^c67difficulty has an average number of enemies and tests a player's 
skill without being too hard. Most players should start on Medium difficulty.

^c[GREEN]Hard ^c67difficulty is very tough, with a large number of enemies and more 
of the stronger types. Hard is intended for veteran Wolfenstein players.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 16 [OSKEYS]
^G96 16 [ONWDORA1]
^c67There are three colors of ^c[GREEN]keycards ^c67in Operation Serpent: blue, yellow, 
and red. Locked doors are marked with the color of the keycard they require, and 
cannot be opened by guards.

^C[GREEN]One-way doors ^c67can be opened from one side but are sealed from the other 
side. The side that is unlocked had a triangle and green lights on it, and the other 
has an octagon.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY
^G32 16 [SWSHWNA1]
^G96 16 [SWIDOOR1]
^c[GREEN]Switches ^c67can trigger doors, pushwalls, and other effects remotely. However, 
a switch can also trigger a trap or release enemies!


^c[GREEN]Remote doors ^c67 require a switch to open them. They cannot be opened normally 
and will remain open permanently when opened with the matching switch.
^P
^C[GREEN]HOW TO PLAY

^C67At the end of each area you will find a passage or an elevator to take you to 
the next area. Once you leave an area you cannot return.

Bonuses will be calculated at the end of each area based on your time and the degree 
to which you explored the level. Killing all the guards, finding all the secrets, 
collecting all the treasure, or beating the ^c[GREEN]par time ^c67will add bonuses 
to your score.
^P
^C[GREEN]ITEMS
^G32 16 [OSHEALTH]
^c67 Your health does not regenerate in Operation Serpent, so you will need to use 
health items to replenish lost health. These items come in four varieties that provide 
different levels of healing.

^C[GREEN]Sandwiches ^c67replenish 4 health, tins of ^C[GREEN]Field Rations ^c67replenish 
16 health, ^C[GREEN]Small Medpaks ^c67replenish 10 health, and ^C[GREEN]Large Medpaks 
^c67give you 25. Large health items are usually stored in out-of-the-way locations.

^P
^C[GREEN]ITEMS
^G32 16 [OSHEALT2]
^c67In addition, there are special health items that can boost your health over the 
normal maximum of 100. ^C[GREEN]Adrenaline Hypos ^c67replenish 2 health, up to a 
maximum of 200. These items are rare at first but appear commonly in Dr. Moerder's 
lab. 

^c[GREEN]Adrenaline Injector Kits ^c67add a whopping 100 points of health (also up 
to 200). These are extremely rare and found in very secluded areas.
^P
^C[GREEN]ITEMS
^G32 16 [OSLOOT]
^c67The Salvaciano government has amassed incredible amounts of wealth from the narcotics 
trade, arms trade, and the theft of the property of non-creoles in San Salvacion. 
Part of your mission is to recover as much of this loot as possible so the drug money 
can be confiscated and the property returned to its rightful owners. Different treasure 
items give different score bonuses depending on value.

^P
^C[GREEN]AMMO
^G96 16 [OS9MM]
^c67Naturally, Operation Serpent's guns need ammo to fire. Unlike Wolfenstein, Operation 
Serpent has several different ammo types for different weapons.




^c[GREEN]9mm Parabellum ^c67ammo is a pistol caliber used by the Glock 17 and Mini 
Uzi. It comes in 12-round magazines and 50 round boxes.
^P
^C[GREEN]AMMO
^G32 16 [OS762MM]
^G96 16 [OS556MM]
^c[GREEN]7.62mm M43 ^c67ammo is an intermediate-power cartridge used by the AKM assault 
rifle. It comes in 10-round SKS stripper clips and 30 round AK magazines.

^c[GREEN]5.56mm NATO ^c67 ammo is a high-velocity American round used by the FN Minimi 
machine gun. It comes in 25-round belts and 100-round boxes.
^P
^C[GREEN]AMMO
^G32 16 [OSSHELL]
^G96 16 [OSROCKET]
^C[GREEN]12 gauge shotgun shells ^c67 used by the San Salvacion Liberation Army are 
loaded with 00 buckshot to do tremendous damage at close range in the Winchester 
1300. They come in sets of four and in 12-round boxes.

^C[GREEN]120mm rockets ^c67 equipped with HEAT anti-tank warheads are used in the 
Mefisto rocket-propelled grenade launcher. They come singly or in crates of three.

^P
^C[GREEN]ENEMIES
^G32 16 [HGRDA]

SSLA Guards ^c67are rear-echelon, inexperienced troops armed with Browning Hi-Power 
9mm pistols. They are slow to react and have limited firepower, but still pose a 
considerable threat in groups.

When killed, SSLA Guards will drop ammo for the Glock 17 and Mini Uzi. They wear 
no armor and take very little damage to kill.
^P
^C[GREEN]ENEMIES
^G32 16 [HNCOA]

SSLA Sergeants ^c67 are more experienced soldiers who lead the Guards in combat. 
While not armored, they do carry Uzis that can be deadly in close quarters.

If you don't have an Uzi yourself, killing an SSLA Sergeant will make him drop his. 
Otherwise they drop 9mm ammo just like the SSLA Guards.
^P
^C[GREEN]ENEMIES
^G32 16 [HSLDA]

SSLA Troopers ^c67are tough, well-trained regulars that form the backbone of the 
San Salvacion Liberation Army. They take several hits to kill due to their body armor 
and are usually armed with AK assault rifles, which can do a great deal of damage 
even at long range. However, some carry shotguns or even heavy weapons like the Mefisto 
RPG.
^P
^C[GREEN]ENEMIES
^G32 16 [HELTA]

SSLA Elites ^c67are the cream of the San Salvacion military, veteran soldiers with 
an absolute faith in the National Liberation Party and its doctrines. They are far 
more accurate with their assault rifles than other troops and can reliably hit targets 
at extreme range. Their heavy armor vests can stop rifle rounds, and they can throw 
hand grenades that can harm you even with a near miss.
^P
^C[GREEN]ENEMIES
^G32 16 [HFLMA]

SSLA Executioners ^c67carry out mass murder operations in San Salvacion. Their flamethrowers 
are absolutely devastating in close quarters and can kill almost instantly, and they 
have the strongest armor in the San Salvacion military, making them excellent ambushers 
as well. When an Executioner is killed, his flamethrower will explode, causing blast 
damage if you are nearby.
^P
^C[GREEN]ENEMIES
^c67 In addition, there are several other types of human and nonhuman enemies to 
encounter in Operation Serpent. We won't spoil the surprise--just be ready for a 
serious fight!

At the end of area 6 you will fight Dr. Moerder, the boss. You must defeat him to 
complete the game. Beware--he is far more dangerous than any normal enemy!
^P
^C[GREEN]HAZARDS

^G96 16 [OSMINE]
^C67 Enemies aren't the only danger in Operation Serpent. San Salvacion is littered 
with hazards and traps that can injure or kill you if you're not careful!

^C[GREEN]Land mines ^c67are common throughout San Salvacion, planted in millions 
since war broke out in the 1950s. Whatever their origin, they hurt--a lot. Look for 
the telltale clump of dirt where a land mine may be buried.
^P
^C[GREEN]HAZARDS
^G32 16 [OSBARREL]
^G96 16 [OSFLAME]

^c[GREEN]Explosive barrels ^c67are filled with noxious, unstable chemicals, and explode 
when shot, damaging anything nearby--including other barrels.

^c[GREEN]Flame traps ^c67 are vents in the floor that project gouts of flame up towards 
the ceiling. Standing near a flame trap when it fires causes severe burns.
^P
^C[GREEN]HAZARDS
^G32 16 [OSSPEAR]
^G96 16 [LAVA1]

^c[GREEN]Spear traps ^c67 project a bundle of spears from the ceiling to impale intruders. 
Unlike flame traps, spear traps are invisible until they trigger.

^c[GREEN]Lava ^c67is a natural hazard found underground. It is extremely hot and 
will burn you even if you are several feet away. Give it a wide berth.
^P

^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^c67^c[GREEN]Coffee Break Episode 1: Castle Hasselhoff ^c67(2014) returns to the 
visual style and atmosphere of the original Wolfenstein 3D while drastically expanding 
the gameplay and features. True to the mod's name, the levels here are generally 
short--but they're also my most devious yet! Only the Wolf gods will survive on Death 
Incarnate!
^P
^G16 16 [TDEMPIC]
^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^c67The ^c[GREEN]ECWolf Tech Demo ^c67(2012) was developed to show the functionality 
of ECWolf 1.0 and recreates the storyline of Wolfenstein episode 1 in 10 levels with 
a huge array of new objects, guards, and weapons.

It is not as advanced as Operation Serpent but really shows the flexibility and power 
of the ECWolf engine compared to the original engine.
^P
^G 16 16 [WSPIC]
^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
Wolfenstein Sextilogy 3 ^c67(2011) recreates the first three episodes of Wolfenstein 
for an older build of ECWolf, merging the original storyline and atmosphere with 
greatly enhanced graphics and features. 

Wolfenstein Sextilogy was originally planned to be six episodes, but a hard drive 
crash ended development of episodes 4-6.
^P
^G 16 16 [SRPIC]
^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^C[GREEN]Spear Revisited ^c67(2007) was my first serious test of the abilities of 
limitless source ports using the Wolf4GW engine. The 21 levels of this game are vastly 
more complex than any I had developed before, and still hold up well.

An ECWolf port was released in 2015, bringing high resolutions and full Windows Vista/7/8/10 
compatibility.
^P
^G 16 16 [E1RPIC]
^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^C[GREEN]Episode One Revisited ^c67(2006) was originally intended to be a drop-in 
replacement for the original Episode 1 levels as I was tired of the TC-like direction 
of the first mods. My levels were however too complex for the original engine and 
I migrated to Wolf4GW.

These ten maps are also available in Wolfenstein Sextilogy 3 as the first episode.

^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^C[GREEN]The Final Assault ^c67(2004) was my second released mod for Wolfenstein, 
running on a slightly modified Project Totengraeber engine. It is noticeably cruder 
than my later works but was better than what I was making earlier.

The only released version of this was an 8-level demo. Development ceased in late 
2004 due to lack of interest.
^P
^G 16 16 [TRTDPIC]
^C[GREEN]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^C[GREEN]The Road to Despair ^c67(2003) was my first released mod, after a long and 
tortuous development starting in December 2000 (the first map was written on Christmas 
Day). I learned the fundamentals of modding in this project, and it shows.

Everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. You should have seen the crap I made in 
'99...

^C[GREEN]POSTSCRIPT
^C67I hope you enjoy playing Operation Serpent. This has been an ambitious and challenging 
mod to develop, but there is much more to come. Expect more advanced and complex 
mods as ECWolf improves and matures.

Until then, go forth and kick ass!
