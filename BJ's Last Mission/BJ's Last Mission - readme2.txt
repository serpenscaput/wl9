I would like to thank you for downloading my little 
game!
This took me about 4 months to create and to get it just 
the way i want it, I hope you enjoy playing it.
I run an old Compaq with windows 95 I use mapedit and 
wolfedit to create this game the source code was unedited.
Special thanks to Bill Kirby for the mapedit and wolfedit
programs, and to Mr. Lowe for adding my game to his 
website.

George
