<p><font face="Georgia">The Obligatory README</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">First off, I should mention that this map replacement
set comes completely UNSUPPORTED.&nbsp; Should not be an issue as there are only

two files enclosed.&nbsp; Due to some spam problems, all email addresses listed
in previous READMEs from my other works have been disabled.&nbsp; Also, as of
June 10th, 2008 (such a mystical and magical day) I have stopped posting and
logging into all forums on-line, so private messages sent to me will never get
read.&nbsp; Just so ya know.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">What you have here is not exactly the first three
episodes of what will eventually be released as <i>acktung 2</i> (how's that for

a completely unoriginal title?).&nbsp; I would think that 20 or so of these
levels will make the final 60-level release, but at least five will not.&nbsp; I

have included four or five levels that have been released in other projects, but

have never been seen in their original form.&nbsp; Some friends asked to see
them, so here ya go.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">These levels are also not in the order they will be in
the final release.&nbsp; Consider this just a 30-level set slapped together
without rhyme or reason.&nbsp; I put this little ditty together as I wanted a
couple of the veterans to play through the levels so that they can answer
specific questions as I have some concerns over a few issues involving game
play.&nbsp; I have put together a new EXE, but because I am a purist, I do not
really want to use it with these levels.&nbsp; I like pure Wolf to be just that
- PURE Wolf!&nbsp; I might just create two releases.&nbsp; One with the new EXE
and one using the original.&nbsp; Time will tell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">The levels themselves are very much in my style.&nbsp;
Some easy, some hard, but I have been able to complete them all on IADI without
saving starting only with a pistol.&nbsp; Mind you, I know all the tricks I put
into the levels, so I know the easiest way to play through them&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
There may be some graphic overload if you kill to many enemies in the same area,

as per usual.&nbsp; Also, I would be a little careful of entering rooms through
a locked door opened by a guard.&nbsp; Should it close...</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">So when will <i>acktung 2</i> be released?&nbsp;
Probably in about a year.&nbsp; I have about 50 levels completed, but I know
some will get axed and I need time to test the living crap out of them
all.&nbsp; I have offered my services to a couple of mega projects, so it could
even be longer depending when these get off the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">On a side note, it amazed me how it has been five years
since the release of the original <i>acktung!</i>&nbsp; I just wanted to take a
second to thank all of those people who have sent me complimentary emails and
messages.&nbsp; I still chuckle at how it has managed to stay on the DHW Top 10
Charts for so long.&nbsp; I really do appreciate the support that level set has
been given!</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Finally, the obligatory thank yous...</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Brian Lowe - for keeping the on-line beacon shining<br>
Brother Tank, MCS, and AReyeP - for DHW and for being a really swell group of
guys<br>
Adam Biser - these levels were made with WDC (it rocks!) and for his being
easily as swell if not sweller<br>
The original line-up at iD<br>
Anybody else I forgot</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Peace,</font></p>
