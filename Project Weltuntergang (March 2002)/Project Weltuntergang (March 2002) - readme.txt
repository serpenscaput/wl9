This is the Final Version of Project:Weltuntergang.I hope you'll enjoy playing it. All the informations are in Read Me in the main menu of the game.

Cheats:

1. wolf3d -kuki in the command line and the standard Tab+letter combinations during the game (some of them were removed and there's a new one: Tab+K - keys).

2. L+I+M - save your game before using it

Sorry for this short readme, but I'm to happy now, when the Project is finished, to write a long text.
