my name for the graphics.

              The Story:

   It is 2055, and you are B.J. Blazcowicz's great-grandson.  You are thrust into 
World War III,
and the Nazis have stolen microchips and toxic objects for an attack on the U.S. 
 Since you
have the same strength as your great-grandpa, you were assigned to go in the dreaded

Castle Wolfenstein to face the Nazi forces.  What's worse, there are rebuilt versions 
of the
enemies your great-grandpa faced.  Dr. Schabbs' grandson has recovered plans for 
Operation:
Eisenfaust.  He has rebuilt Hitler and Hans Grosse.  Cyber-Hitler is in a bunker 
underneath 
Castle Wolfenstein, Schabbs is in a secret lab in the castle, and Hans is all over 
the place.
Now, load your Allied Handgun, and go to the castle!
