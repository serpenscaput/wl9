--AUTUMN'S ADVENTURE DEMO VERSION--
-------------------Beta Version 1.0---------------------
Description: You are Autumn, an Alicorn who is
best friends with Angel and Nocturnus. One day,
you were taken by Lord Tirek, and had your powers
taken away and was thrown into a prison cell deep
below the Castle of the Two Sisters. And it is up to
you to escape this madness and take down Tirek!

NOTE: Be sure to open the "PlayAutumn.BAT" file, not
the ecwolf one!

*This is the Beta version of the demo, updates and
changes will come out soon!

Hope you would enjoy my game I created for
Shadayloronic!
