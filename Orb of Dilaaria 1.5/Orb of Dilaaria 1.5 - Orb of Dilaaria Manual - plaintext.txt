STORY
The land of the Seven Kingdoms was once the peaceful
creation of Eilior, the Great Being. There were nine lesser
beings who served as council to Eilior called the
Nonacyclus. Among them was Wersin, the Deceiver, who
left the council to descend upon the world thus shattering its
peace.
For protection, Eilior gave man the gift of the Orb, which
strengthens the weapons of the Seven Kingdoms. However,
as a weapon becomes further from the Orb, its power wanes.
The elders of the Seven Kingdoms met and declared that the
Orb be kept within the castle of Dilaaria, since it was nearest
the center of all the lands. However, this left the southernmost land, Drami-on, 
without the power of the Orb.
The dark clouds of war covered the land as Wersin's
henchmen swarmed the countryside. For many years the
Seven Kingdoms have kept the lands safe, but recent
sightings suggest that a great army is rising against them
from the south. According to scouts, Wersin has ravaged the
lands of Drami-on and stolen their enchanted weapons to
equip a massive army.
As a royal guard for King Hylorn, ruler of Dilaaria, you have
been ordered to guard the Orb's chamber. From deep within
the castle, you only hear muffled sounds as they echo down
the hallways toward you. One voice cuts through the

jumbled mess: "The enemy approaches!" You listen as the
soft murmur rises to the panicked chatter of war. The Dark
Army of Wersin has arrived.
Torches dot the fields around the castle. Soon arrows are
loosed from all directions. Ladders spring from the ground
and the twisted deformities of the Dark Army have soon
breached the wall. The knights of the Seven Kingdoms fight
valiantly but to no avail. You prepare for battle as you hear
the main gates burst open.
Thirty or more demonic beings charge down the hallway
toward you and the other royal guards. You are soon
surrounded by them. The ten of you are no match for the
constant flow of demons and the other guards soon fall dead
at your side. A sharp blow to the back of your head sends
you sprawling to the ground. As your vision begins to dim,
you see the demons smash the door leading to the Orb's
chamber...
You awake surprised to see that you're still alive. You look
around and discover that you are in a small dungeon cell
littered with bones and fleshy debris. This can only mean
that you are trapped deep within Zaehylos' dungeon, the vile
prison of the ancient stories. Many heroes have been held
inside its walls, but none have escaped.
You try to stand, but your head is still spinning with pain and

you fall upon a pile of bones. A strange snort echoes outside
the door to your cell. Ignoring the pain, you stand again and
grab a broken bone from the floor. Within seconds there is a
snarl right outside the door and you hide in a darkened
corner of your cell. The door slides open and a foot soldier
enters the room. You lunge at it, knocking it to the ground.
A surprised scream pierces your ears as you shove the
shattered end of the bone into its body.
Convinced that it is dead, you grab its mace and prepare for
what lies ahead. If you can't escape, at least you'll leave the
mark of your presence in the hearts of your enemies...

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS GAME
This game is to be distributed free of charge. Share it with your friends!
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
This game should run on almost any Windows system. Starting with
Windows XP, DOSBox is required to hear sounds correctly and on a 64-bit
OS, DOSBox is required to run the program at all, but don't worry, the
installation process sets everything up for you.
Page 1

NAVIGATING THE MENUS
The game's menu system mimics that of
Wolfenstein 3-D. When you start the
game, you are presented with the main
menu. From it you can change game
play options, read the in-game manual,
or start a new game.
NEW GAME
Of course since you've installed the
game, you probably want to play it.
Before you do, you have to pick your
difficulty level. “Leave the lights on” is
the easiest and “Death scares me not!” is
the most difficult.
SOUND
On this menu you can change the sound
effects, the digitized sounds, and toggle
the music. For best sound results, use
the Sound Blaster settings as shown in
the image to the right.
CONTROL
From this menu you can set up your
mouse, joystick, and keyboard settings.
This is where you set up which button or
key press does which action in the game.
Mouse sensitivity determines how
quickly your mouse causes you to move.
Page 2

LOAD/SAVE GAME
You are allowed to have up to 60 saved
games. This allows you to save as many
times as you want in case you want to
back track to a previous scene to take a
different path.
OPTIONS
By default, all graphical enhancements
are enabled, but if you find that the
game runs slowly on your computer, try
disabling some of them.

READ THIS!
This is the in-game manual and the
information that can be found in it can
also be found in this manual. However,
the in-game manual provides easier
access when you're.... in a game.
HIGH SCORES
You have to battle your way through
many levels and defeat Wersin to make
it on this list. Are you ready for the
challenge?
QUIT
When you're ready to quit the game and
do something boring, pick this.
Page 3

THE GAME SCREEN
The game screen in this game is just like
that of Wolfenstein 3-D and most other
first-person shooters. The top portion of
the screen is where the action takes place
and the bottom is the status bar.
THE STATUS BAR
You'll want to keep a close eye on what the status bar tells you.

1. This is the act and scene you are currently playing in the game. Orb
of Dilaaria consists of six acts with each act containing five scenes.
2. It's you! Your face will change depending on the amount of damage
you have sustained or the type of death you have died.
3. Your current and maximum health points. Though the maximum
amount never changes, some items can temporarily boost your health
points above the maximum.
4. This is your score. You get points by collecting treasure and wiping
out enemies.
5. Your life scrolls. You start with 3 life scrolls and use one each time
you die. When a life scroll is used, a mystical force heals you and takes
you back to the beginning of the scene. The only drawback is that you
lose all of your items and magic points in the process.
Page 4

6.

Your current weapon. Use it wisely.

7. Your current and maximum magic points. Skull packs will increase
your maximum to 200. It would be good to find one quickly.
8.

Keys to doors in the scene.

9. Indicates that you are able to go under water without drowning. This
is a temporary effect, so watch out when it starts to flash!
10. Indicates that you are invincible to all damage, including the effects
of lava and slime. This is a temporary effect.
11. Indicates that you are invisible to enemies. They can, however, still
hear you. This is a temporary effect.
12. Indicates that you are poisoned and will lost 1 health point per second
until you health yourself somehow (or die, whichever happens first).
13. Indicates that you are paralyzed. You can no longer move, but you
can still attack. This is a temporary effect.
14. Indicates that you have been “slugged”, which means that your
movement has been slowed down considerably. You can still attack at the
same speed, though. This is a temporary effect.
15. Indicates that you have the Orb! Congratulations! Now to get home!
16. The number of soul crystals you have.
17. Indicates which weapons you have. The highlighted numbers show
which keyboard keys to press to switch weapons.

ITEMS IN THE GAME
The environment inside Orb of Dilaaria is rich with a variety of different
items. Some are useful, some are harmful.
HEALTH
Even Wersin's armies need some nourishment. Grab some for yourself to
help you on your quest. In addition to granting health points, all of these
items cure poison.
Bread
Healing: 4
Useful when you only need to top your hit points or if you're
in desperate need.

Mutton
Healing: 10
Pretty tasty and filling!

Health Sphere
Healing: 25
Blessings from Eilior? Maybe, because these are great to
find.

Page 6

ARTEFACTS
Those who have fallen before you have dropped several useful artefacts.
Use them wisely or you'll find yourself in a desperate situation.
Life Scroll
Summary: +1 life (up to 9), +99 hp (up to 200), +25 mp (up
to current limit), also considered a treasure item
These scrolls take you to the beginning of a scene when you
die. Also grant a temporary health boost and heal poison.
Invisibility Ring
Summary: Invisible for 30 seconds (cumulative)
Provides temporary protection from being seen. However,
you can still be heard and once they know you are nearby,
the beasts will attack relentlessly.
Skull Pack
Summary: Sets max mp to 200, +25 mp, +50 hp (up to
200)
These demonic looking packs will help your magic last
longer. Grab them when possible.
Heroic Brew
Summary: Invincible for 30 seconds (cumulative), mace
causes 4 times more damage
This bitter drink temporarily makes you invincible and your
attacks stronger. The catch? You can only use your mace!
Mermaid Artefact
Summary: Can breath under water for 30 seconds
(cumulative)
Provides a temporary air supply under water.
Page 7

TREASURE
Wersin has accumulated quite a collection of treasures. You might as well
take some back to the kingdoms from which they were stolen.
Coin
Points: 100

Gem
Points: 500

Pendant
Points: 1000

Ruby Encrusted Skull
Points: 5000

Page 8

WEAPONS
You're going to need something to help you fight against Wersin's armies!
Mana Pouch
These enable you to use the magical weapons you find. If
your magic runs out, you still have your mace.
Soul Crystal
These are used to power the Unsummoner.

Boom Staff
Your average lightweight magic wand. Packs a punch, but
is not so great against stronger beasts.
The Inflictor
A rapid fire magic crossbow always makes things
interesting.
Death Wand
Nothing takes down large amounts of enemies faster than
this!
The Unsummoner
Mystery surrounds this weapon. No one knows exactly what
it does. All that is known is that it wields a power so great
that Wersin keeps it hidden within his land so that no one
can find it.
Page 9

OTHER ITEMS
These will help you find your way to the Orb and out of Wersin's domain.
Keys
Keys are used to unlock doors.

Tomes of Knowledge
Anytime you see a book, read it! Surely Wersin and his
beasts have left behind some information as to where they
can be found. You need to learn what he and his armies are
planning, so read as much as you can. Who knows? They
might even help you find your way out!
Green Portal
Green portals take you to another area within the map.

Red Portal
Red portals take you to the next scene.

Page 10

HAZARDS
Wersin has created a variety of foul nuisances. Tread with caution!
Slime
Special: Takes 1 hp per second
Wersin has devised a liquid that is harmful to touch. It's
unlike anything you've ever seen. You must warn your
people about this treacherous sludge before he can release it
upon the world.
Possessed Walls
Special: Shoots fireballs
Trapped in stone, these tormented souls attack anything that
gets in their path. Watch yourself or you'll be toast.

Poison Mushrooms
Special: Once infected, takes 1 hp per second.
Be careful when running around outside or you might
trample these mushrooms and release their poisonous
spores into the air. If you do become infected, never fear,
just find something with which you can heal yourself.
Lava
Special: Takes 5 hp per second
A wise person would stay away from this flesh-burning
substance. A fast runner might be able to cross short
patches of lava unharmed, but beware: some lava can
engulf you.

Page 11

BESTIARY
MINIONS
Wersin's army features a wide variety of foul beasts, many of which have
special abilities. This information can also be found in the game after you
play the scene that introduces the beast.
Sentry
Points: 200
Special: None
You're lucky if you catch one alone because they like to
overwhelm their enemies with sheer numbers. Approach a
group with caution because they can back you into a corner.
Warrior
Points: 100
Special: None
Wersin's warriors are dedicated to doing his bidding. They
stop at nothing to complete his vile tasks. Be sure to grab
the staff when you kill one.
Guardian
Points: 500
Special: Throws fireballs
This foul brute really packs a punch and if you want to
survive, you'd best steer clear of it. It summons powers
from the Void and channels them into a torrent of fireballs.
Kirapter
Points: 200
Special: Poisonous bite
Don't let these flying menaces get close to you because one
bite has enough poison to grant you a slow, painful death.
Page 12

Serpa
Points: 700
Special: None
These slithering foes are fast and deadly. You had better act
the same way toward them or you will soon fall.

Araknemon
Points: 200
Special: Throws webbing and has a poisonous bite
Wersin awakened the araknemons from their sleep deep
within the heart of the earth. Beware should one come at
you from a distance because their webbing will temporarily
entangle you so they can come closer to poison you with one
bite of their deadly fangs.
Karkass
Points: 400
Special: Throws fireballs
For a rotten pile of flesh and bones, Karkass is a worthy
opponent. Eternally damned to live a tormented life after
death, Karkass roams the lands hunting the living.
Flamus
Points: 200
Special: Silent and throws fireballs
A wretched union of plant and animal, Flamus attacks
anything that gets close to it. How it manages to hurl
fireballs at its victims, we may never know. One thing is for
sure, caution must be used when near these silent attackers.
Page 13

Wippen
Points: 200
Special: Silent
Wippen hides away below the ground waiting to attack. No
amount of running can help you escape them for their reach
is fast and their hold is strong. Always watch the ground!
Nekrodaemon
Points: 2000
Special: Throws fireballs
High priests for Wersin, nekrodaemons are among his most
trusted servants. He has given them the ability to focus his
anger into a fiery sphere to strike down his foes.
Wraith
Points: 300
Special: Invisible until active
These lost souls are forever cursed to roam the world.
Called upon by Wersin, they lay in hiding to watch his
enemies with unseen eyes. What you don't see can kill you.
Nowhere is safe from their presence.
Slug
Points: 300
Special: Throws axes that cause temporary slowness
So called not due to being slow to act, but due to being
powerful. When he's too far away to strike you with his axe,
he throws it in hopes of slowing you down.

Page 14

Paishkyn
Points: 500
Special: Throws fireballs
Possibly an incantation gone wrong, this humanoid fish
lurks in the shadowy depths. Some strange magic has given
them the ability to produce a flame beneath water, so watch
out!
Web Lord
Points: 200
Special: Throws webbing and fireballs
When the araknemons were awakened, so was their master.
He directs their actions through his antennae. Destroying
him should send them into disarray. Right?!?
Wyvern
Points: 300
Special: Throws fireballs
Wyverns have plagued mankind's existence for centuries.
With a heart filled with the desire to inflict pain and
suffering, they hunt their prey with a vigilance that is
astounding.
Reccah
Points: 500
Special: Shoots twin fireballs
An apparition of peculiar circumstances, the reccah are
beings who glide through the air using an unknown force.
Be wary of them, however, because looks can kill.

Page 15

Orcus
Points: 15000
Special: Almost invincible and brutally strong, but does not
count toward kills
Though extremely slow, this brute should not be taken
lightly because he's unbelievably strong. His step might be
slow, but he's quick to smash out your innards if you get too
close. It's best not to worry about killing him. More thought
should be given to escaping him!
BOSSES
Wersin has selected five top commanders to help him organize his assault
on humanity.
Zaehylos
Points: 5000
Special: Throws crushing hammers
This colossus guards the entrance (and exit) to the dungeon
and torture chambers found below Wersin's demonic
cathedral.
Mallus
Points: 5000
Special: Shoots fireballs
The ancient myths mention a demonic being known as
Mallus, the visage of Wersin in the overworld. These myths
also mention many live sacrifices performed in his name.
Dreko
Points: 5000
Special: Shoots fireballs and electricity
Dreko commands of Wersin's army in the overworld.
Page 16

Yserbnira
Points: 5000
Special: Shoots fireballs
Known as the Watcher of the Forest, Yserbnira resides in
one of the fortresses of the underworld.

Somondre
Points: 5000
Special: Shoots fireballs
Somondre is the guardian of the forest who calls upon the
spirits of fallen demons to rise for service in Wersin's
armies.
Wersin
Points: 10000
Special: Unknown
Not much is known about Wersin's physical manifestation
because nobody has survived his presence.
OTHER CHARACTERS
You'll also find these characters in Wersin's domain.
Note: Killing these creatures is not beneficial in any way. It can even be
detrimental to do so.
Rats
Though they may be annoying and they might get in the way
at times, they are simply rats. They hold no allegiance to
Wersin, so you have no need to fear them.
Page 17

Monks
These beings care nothing about war and try to keep their
minds focused on the worship of Wersin and his demons.
Just because they won't attack you, doesn't mean you should
bother them very much.
Ferox
Some monks have been blessed by Mallus and granted life
after death. The ferox believes in one thing: vengeance.
Woe unto those who have to battle these foul beasts.
HINTS
It is wise to use the mace to take out enemies as much as possible. Some
scenes lack mana to replace your magic points.
Avoid the orcus! You cannot kill him with your might or magic.
Avoid killing monks. They can block your path, but killing them
sometimes unleashes the ferox!
When going under water, You should grab any mermaid artefacts you see.
Some scenes, however, require you to enter the water several times, so it
might be good to leave some if you can.
Being invincible, invisible, or able to breath under water are temporary
effects. However, these effects are also cumulative. If you have 10
seconds of invisibility remaining when you grab an invisibility ring, 30
seconds are added to the 10 you already have.
Learn how to use the inflictor for long distance shots. Unlike your other
weapons, the damage it causes does not lessen due to the distance.
Page 18

Save your game before ending a scene. Some scenes have more than one
exit, each leading to a different scene. Some scenes are harder than others
so if you are stuck in one scene, you might try going back and choosing a
different exit.
If you are lost and can't find the way out, retrace your steps. Wersin's
domain is ever-changing and the area you just left can be very different
when you return.

Page 19

CHEAT CODES
To use the cheat, or debug, codes, you'll have to make a small change to
the dosboxOrbOfDilaaria.conf file in the game's install folder. Open the
file in a text editor, scroll down to the [autoexec] section at the bottom,
and type... HEY! WAIT A MINUTE! I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
HOW TO CHEAT!
TRIVIA
The building in the title screen is from a picture Adam took of the Biserica
Neagra (Black Church) in Brasov, Romania. The church received its name
due to a great fire in 1689 that blackened its outer walls.
Orb of Dilaaria started as a total conversion with no code changes, but that
soon changed.
The Death Wand was originally a sword that could shoot magic in rapid
succession and the mace was a jagged bone shard.
The original idea for the game was written down on June 11, 2003 under
the title of "Dungeon of Destiny". The game was also called "Orb of
Madjik" for a short time.
The game was envisioned, written, rewritten, tested, and released in
exactly three years.
At one point during development, the game had six additional guard types
and the bosses were directional (not just front-facing).
The monks are speaking Romanian.

ODDS 'N ENDS
Touchplates
Wersin has cast strange spells over his possessions. Some to
bring death upon his enemies, others to confuse them.
Beware of what evil may be unlocked by stepping on a touchplate.
Special Floor Colors
If you have textured flats disabled, you will notice that there are some
special floor colors to help you know what is happening.

TROUBLESHOOTING
This section pertains to running the game in DOSBox.
Sound is choppy OR game play is not smooth.
Be sure that all other Windows applications are closed. DOSBox can be
resource-intensive. If no other applications are open, try lowering or
increasing the DOSBox CPU cycles.
Inflictor bolts do not appear when firing at something nearby.
If the game is running at a low frame rate, the bolts might move to quickly
to appear on the screen when firing at something very close to you. Even
though they might not appear, they will still damage enemies.
There's no sound (the Sound Blaster was not detected).
Occasionally DOSBox seems to cause the game to not detect the Sound
Blaster. Exit and restart until the game detects it and turn on the sound
again.

Note
A Game Setup application is available in the game's start menu and
installation folder. This application provides easy access to some of
DOSBox's settings. If you are familiar with editing DOSBox CONF files,
feel free to try changing other settings in the dosboxOrbOfDilaaria.conf
file in game's install folder.
