Introduction
----------------

     All new floors for Spear of Destiny (SOD) add-on mission two game 
     owners, these floors are packed with more action and surprises. 
     Hitler has risen once again. He has made his castle harder to 
     penetrate and escape from. He have gathered more guards for protecting 
     his castle. They have well hidden the keys and place less foods 
     and ammo throughout each floor. So take my advice, eat light and 
     lay off the trigger buddy. ***WARNING*** Play at your own risk, 
     I am not responsible for your color blindness due to seeing too 
     much red.  Finally enjoy yourself but do not over do it.

General Information
-------------------------------

	You are about to enter a world of all new floors and challenges for 
     the Spear of Destiny game. I designed these floors that you are about 
     to play primarily for the add-on mission two of the Spear of Destiny 
     game. I have tested these floors with the original mission and add-on 
     mission three of Spear of Destiny, and they are fully compatible. The 
     only disadvantages of using these missions with these new floors are 
     that the object may appear as something other than what was actually 
     put in that position. For Example, In add-on mission two, a dead rat 
     would appear as a bucket in the original mission, and the walls will 
     appear differently in the add-on mission three. 
	I created this software and these floor designs out of hard work 
     and much time spent getting this software and these floor designs 
     prepared for uses. Now, I state that you may not modify this software, 
     translate, disassemble, recompile, reverse engineer it in any form other 
     than the way this software and these floor designs were originally 
     designed. You may not use any part or parts of these floor designs in 
     your own creation(s) without written permission from Jamie E. Edwards 
     saying you can do so. Remember that this software and these floor 
     designs are protected under United States copyright laws. 
	All software mentioned in this text is copyright by their respective 
     owners. 
	Sending any payment for this software is not necessary. I distributed 
     this software as shareware. All I ask you to send me is your opinion(s) 
     about these floors by E-mail.

Installing
-------------

      FLOORS.EXE is self extracting file. To decompress this file in 
      a target directory type the following:

		FLOORS.EXE and press ENTER or RETURN
      
      After decompressing these files, there are two ways to install 
      these new floor designs: 

	1. From within the directory where the FLOORS.EXE files are
	   stored, type INSTALL.BAT at the DOS prompt. INSTALL.BAT will
	   automatically install the new floor designs in the C:\SPEAR 
	   directory, but if you have the Spear of Destiny files in a 
	   different drive or directory you will have to use the following 
	   syntax below in order to install automatically: 
				    
		  INSTALL [d:]\[directory]
		  [d:] = hard drive letter
		  [directory] = Spear of Destiny directory
		      
			 Example: INSTALL D:\SOD
		      
	2. In the Spear of Destiny directory, rename GAMEMAPS.SOD to 
	   GAMEMAPS.ORI and MAPHEAD.SOD to MAPHEAD.ORI. Then copy the new
	   floor designs into the Spear of Destiny directory. See Rename in
	   your DOS manual for further information.
	     
      You may play either the original designs or the new floor designs by 
      using the file ORI2SOD.BAT. This file renames the original floor 
      designs so that the new floor designs can be played and vice versa:
	    
		  ORI2SOD [d:]\[directory] [Option]
		  [d:] = hard drive letter      
		  [directory] = Spear of Destiny directory
		  [Option] = [/O]riginal designs or [/N]ew designs
		  
			Example: ORI2SOD C:\SPEAR /O
	 This will rename the game files so that the original designs 
	 can be played.

			Example: ORI2SOD C:\SPEAR /N
	 This will rename the game files so that the new floor designs 
	 can be played.

       **NOTE**
	    In order for ORI2SOD.BAT to work properly you must have run 
	    INSTALL.BAT first or manually rename the original floor designs
	    with the *.ORI and new floor designs with *.JEE extensions.
