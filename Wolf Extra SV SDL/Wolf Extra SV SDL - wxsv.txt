Wolf-Extra SV has 21 levels including 6 secret levels.
The remaining 20 levels from the original DOS version of Wolf-Extra are added to Enemy Around the Corner 4SDL as Wolf-Extra Prologue.

The "Death Incarnate" difficulty level of Wolf-Extra is designed to be as difficult as possible without being impossible!
It is possible to get the 100% ratio in the "kill" and "treasure" categories on all levels, including the boss- and secret levels.
Some levels are designed so that the use of some secret doors eliminates the use of others, and vice versa.
Although it is possible to get 100% secrets in many levels it is not possible in some levels.
It is recommended that you don't bother particularly with getting 100% ratio in the "secret" category in any level. 
  
All levels have been tested and won on "Death Incarnate" with total ratios of 100% in the "kill" and "treasure" categories.

Remember to leave saved games in different slots so that you may go back to different stages of the level you are on if you need to.

Please note: Some of the secret levels have very difficult openings!
Leave a saved game at the previous level before you enter a secret level!
