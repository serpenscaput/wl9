^C[Red]NOT AGAIN.....
^C00For being such a bad ass secret agent, you sure do suck, Agent Blazcowicz.  Captured 
yet again.  What is this shit?!  I mean, you escape every single Nazi prison, but 
they are still able to lock you up?  Ridiculous.

Well, time to escape again, I guess.  Next time, don't go out into the field stoned, 
K?

^c00This is a compilation of many vanilla Wolf3D mods, mostly early map replacement 
sets.  These maps were released from the years of 1993-2006.  There are many varying 
degrees of difficulty.  I tried to put most of the easy ones first.

There is a complete list of the levels used in this mod inside the .PK3 (the file 
named READ)
