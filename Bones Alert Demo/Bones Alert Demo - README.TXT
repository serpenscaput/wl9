Bones Alert Demo

The map files supplied are to be used with a copy of the 60 level version of Wolfenstein 
3D.

This is my first attempt at releasing maps for Wolf 3D. There are 2 new levels, both 
on episode one. The first is a very large level with 148 guards on the highest difficulty 
level. There are many secret areas to find, including a secret elevator to level 
10. Getting all 100% ratios for level one is very difficult and should provide quite 
a challenge. The second level is a Boss level, a bonus level featuring Schabbs and 
some decorative effects.

Other episodes have been removed for copyright reasons.
