Thanks for playing Silencer!

This is a TC of Wolfenstein 3D by id Software. This mod was developed by Sheridan 
"Redeemer" Rathbun and Sterling "Woodstock" Rathbun as a hobby. This game is similar 
to the original Wolfenstein 3D, but with a several noted differences:

-A futuristic theme
-New sound effects
-3 totally new episodes ( the demo version only contains one episode )
-Completely new graphics
-New weapons
-New enemies
-And Teleporters

A note about the teleporters: when you walk into a teleporter, you are instantly 
transported to some other location on the level. Normally this puts you into a hostile 
situation, and due to the nature of teleporters, you can't travel back to where you 
started until you finish the area you teleported to. Be careful!

The demo version only contains one episode. You can access the other two episodes, 
but they are far from complete, and only contain one test level each. These levels 
are not meant to stay, and will not be in the full version.

This game is incomplete! Feel free to ask any questions or state any comments, but 
remember this when you comment or review the game.

If you're having difficulty playing the game, just start a new game and turn down 
the difficulty. We have tested the game, and it is completely beatable on all skill 
levels. Don't send us complaint emails, unless you think it's really a problem!

Thanks, and any comments and questions you can send to skrathbun@earthlink.net
