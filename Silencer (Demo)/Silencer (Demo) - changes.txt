Thanks for downloading version 2 of this demo. The first demo, I felt, was very incomplete 
and almost featureless from a coding standpoint. This new version contains:

*Gun Bobbing
*Replaced Music
*Ceiling and Floor Textures
*Level fixes and changes
*Other minor things

One thing about this demo: The floor and ceiling textures take up a lot of memory, 
and you should make sure to feed enough memory to your emulator before you try to 
play the game.

Thanks again for playing Silencer, and I hope you enjoy this demo! Any questions 
or comments should be sent to skrathbun (at) earthlink.net
