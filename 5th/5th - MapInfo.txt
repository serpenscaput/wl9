About this File: 
Here's some info that you might want to know about the levels. 
The main thing on this file is to tell the background of the map.
Happy? 

..I knew it.


Episode 3 - Floor 1: Entryway

This level was made in about 30 minutes, and that's not bad. I used to make levels for SoD like in 18-20 minutes, it was fast becuase I had them drawn in paper and the only thing that I had to do was to make them and play them.

Anyway, this level is short. When you start, you have 2 choices. The first one is going to the left and getting some ammo. The right way is just to o straight and get that damned gold key and exit the freaking level. You will notice that there is not a single treasue around. Well, it's hidden, just check on any wall that you think there might be something and there you have it.
Officers and Guards populate this level.

Episode 3 - FLoor 2: Unlinearlistic

This map was going to be the first level for an Episode that I had in mind, "...and Death Came Along." I lost interest in doing that project so I left those maps somewhere on my HD.
This level is short...way to short. You don't have to get no fancy gold/silver keys to get out, just kill kick some guard's & SS's butt and you'll be fine..
..this map is hard right from the start.
You can get to the exit from 2 different ways, I though that made the level more...unlinear.
There's a cool secret somewhere on this level..w/ 2 1ups and a chaingun. = )

Episode 3 - Floor 3: Gretel..is that you?

Well..the maps can't be getting any more easy. This map has lost of corridors to explore, and it's fun, and colorfull. I really like this map becuase it's not like any other level for wolf. You need to get the yellow key from Gretel, and then you need to fight some more w/ a few SS's and Officers...did I say a few? well, I'm wrong.
You can get the chaingun from a easy to find secret, and some health if you have trouble w/ Gretel.

Episode 3 - Floor 4: Tight Walls

A friend of mine (Tobias Munch), is making a 10 level episode. He is not on a rush of getting that finished, but I'd seen his map and I made one for his set. The style that he has is a completly new thing from anything that I have seen. There are tight maps out there, but these maps are really fun and they actually make scence.

Anyway, I tried to make this map tight, but I don't think I did a good job at it.
The level is really hard, and it might be a little confusing, but is very straight forward.
Lost of badguys, and you need to kill Hans to actually get the yellow key, then find the silver key and finally...exit the damned level.

Episode 3 - Floor 5: The 19th Floor

This map was for a 2 level set called "The 19th Floor", which was for SoD. I relesead it but never got much attention 'cause it had 2 levels (The other one was e1f1 of "Escape!" but it wasn't anything like the first version). The map is based on the original secret level of SoD, and it was at floor 19. The map has a similar start, but the rest is different. 
I really love this level, and it's one of the weirdest ones that I have done for Wolf. 

The level uses all the enemy's (no mutants or bosses though), and it ends w/ a Ending trigger. this map is really cool if you play it w/ Sod's "Jazzin' Them Nazis" song.
