WOLFENSTEIN 3-D Add-On

(See end of file for information on obtaining WOLFENSTEIN 3-D.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Start:

    (1)  In your WOLF3D subdirectory
            rename MAPHEAD.WL1 and GAMEMAPS.WL1
            to     MAPHEAD.SAV and GAMEMAPS.SAV     (for backup purposes)

    (2)  Rename any files named SAVEGAMx.WL1 to SAVEGAMx.SAV
            (where x is a digit from 0 to 9)

    (3)  Copy the files included in this ZIP to your WOLF3D directory

    (4)  Go play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

More complete information:

Included herewith are two files that provide ten new levels for
the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3-D (tm).  These files replace
the equivalently named files that were provided with the original
program.  (Note that this product will only work with shareware
versions of Wolfenstein 3-D released after 6/1/92.  See below for
information about the map files.)

Before installing, I recommend that you first copy the two original
files so that they may be retrieved later.  These files are:

    MAPHEAD.WL1   and   GAMEMAPS.WL1

You should copy these into MAPHEAD.SAV and GAMEMAPS.SAV.

Note that any saved games will be rendered inoperable once you install
this add-on.  If you would like to be able to recall these saved games
(after recalling the original MAPHEAD and GAMEMAPS files), you should
back them up before installing the add-on files.  Saved game files
are named SAVEGAMx.WL1 (where x is a digit from 0 to 9).  Copy these
into SAVEGAMx.SAV before installing the new MAP files.

After backing up any desired files, simply copy the included files into
your Wolfenstein 3-D directory.

Some words about the map files:

All versions of Wolfenstein 3-D have two files that are used to describe
the maps.  The larger of these files contains hex codes that are used
to identify every graphic element of the map.  The smaller one is used
as a sort of table of contents so the program will know where to look
up data in the main map file.  There are a number of other files that
come with the program, but the map descriptions are entirely contained
within the two aforementioned files.

Early in the development of Wolfenstein 3-D, the map data file had
its name changed.  This change apparently occurred with the 6/1/92
release of the program.  The table-of-contents filename was not
modified.  The filenames are as follows:

       Table of Contents:      MAPHEAD.WLx    (all versions)

       Map Data File:          MAPTEMP.WL1    (shareware versions
                                               prior to 6/1/92)
                               GAMEMAPS.WLx   (versions after 6/1/92)

The file extensions are encoded by the number of levels available.
That is, since the shareware game contains only one level, the
extensions are WL1.  If you have registered, and paid for the entire
set, the extensions are WL6.  I'm not positive, but I think there is
also a three level set available, in which case the extensions are
WL3.  Spear of Destiny, the sequel to Wolfenstein 3-D, has SOD as
the extension.

Version 1.0 of Wolfenstein was dated 5/5/92, and had a few bugs.
Version 1.1 came out on 5/20/92, but the file naming convention had
not been modified.  A new Version 1.1 was released on 6/1/92 with the
new map filename.  The latest version, 1.4, was released on 12/1/92.
The version number is shown on the Wolfenstein 3-D opening screen in
the lower right corner.

The bottom line is, if you have a version dated prior to 6/1/92, and
you want to install an add-on such as the one included here, make sure
it has the MAPHEAD and MAPTEMP files.  If you have a version after
6/1/92, make sure the add-on filenames are compatible with the names
in your original set (including the suffix that is on the file
extension that indicates the number of game levels.)
