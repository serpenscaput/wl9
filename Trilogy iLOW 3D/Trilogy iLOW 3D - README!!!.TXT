
The Trilogy - iLOW3D											17 January 2014


Here's a new mod and the fourth add-on by Ipank7000, 30 new levels. This is the SDL 
version so dosbox or any dos emulator isn't neccessary
to play this mapset. 


Because i learned the weapon coding and i want make a simple mod, so i released this 
thing and that's it.

Thanks to:

 * The God, who has given favors, so i can finish this mapset nicely		
 * id Software for releasing the Wolf3d source code
 * Ripper for creating the Wolf4SDL engine to play Wolf3d in Windows
 * Florian Stohr which create Floedit
 * All members of DHW and Haven forum and all Wolfers who make this game still alive

---------------------------
Update:
* I updated the map because it has very mazy secret in some levels. So i reduce them 
and you can play the updated map in    "Updated Levels" folder.
* (09/03/2014) Fixed the rifle accurate. (Thanks for MrWolfForever for reporting)

* (10/03/2014) Fixed the secret on E2L6 in "Updated Maps". (Thanks for Thomas reporting)

* (16/03/2014) Fixed the secret on E2L3 in "Updated Maps" and "holo wall" glitch. 
(Thanks for MrWolfForever reporting)
	       Reduce the E2L1 difficulty (by adding some goodies only, not reduce the enemies) 
(in "Updated Maps" only).
* (23/03/2014) Fixed enemy placement in Hitler's Room (Both version of the map).

---------------------------
Note:

* I have tested ALL the map (from pistol start) and it POSSIBLE to get 100%
* DON'T try cheating or using warp parameter or you will screw !!! ^_^ 
* You can hurt yourself by pressing I+T+A if you get locked and you accidentally

  save the game (You can use this if you want to challenge yourself :P)

---------------------------
Known Bugs:
* Sometimes the game freeze. To get rid this problem save your game often, exit the 
game and load it.
