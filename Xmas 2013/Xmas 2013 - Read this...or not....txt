Merry Xmas 20103!!

Here's a little 1 level Xmas mod made for a bit of fun.

This uses the exe base of Arielus' Xmas mod, so credit goes to him and id games for 
the base Wolf 3d sprites these were based on. Credit to DoomJedi for some sprites 
aI used. Some additional sprites are from Xmas Wolf and the rest I made or edited 
myself. If I missed crediting anyone, please let me know and I'll update this.

Hope you enjoy the level, it was fun to make. Who knows, maybe I'll make one each 
year :)
