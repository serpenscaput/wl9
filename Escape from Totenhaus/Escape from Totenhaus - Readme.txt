Description: 10 levels for Wolf 3D, replacing the first episode
This is a port of a Mac scenario I originally created in 1996.

Story: It's the spring of 1943. You're working as an undercover agent behind enemy 
lines, passing yourself off as a German in a quaint Bavarian village. One afternoon, 
you're sitting in a tavern sipping schnapps and flirting with a pretty fraulein when 
someone identifies you as an Allied spy. Before you can amiably protest and offer 
to buy the man a drink, somebody else hits you on the back of the head and the lights 
go out.

The next thing you know, you wake up in what appears to be the basement of a large 
mansion. But this is no ordinary mansion. This is Totenhaus (House of Death), the 
dreaded location where Allied spies are taken to be interrogated and executed, and 
overseen by a contingent of cruelly efficient Gestapo and Waffen-SS.

Until now, no one has escaped from Totenhaus alive. Will you be the first?

Installation: Rename your gamemaps.wl6, maphead.wl6, vswap.wl6, vgagraph.wl6 and 
vgahead.wl6 files, then put the files in this archive into your Wolf 3D directory.


If you have any problems with the included vgagraph and vgahead files, just use the 
originals that come with Wolf3D. All the new ones do is replace the title screen.
