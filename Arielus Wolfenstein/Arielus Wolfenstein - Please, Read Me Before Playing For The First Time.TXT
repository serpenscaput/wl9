 Hi there, Wolfenstein 3D community.
 My name's Norberto Ariel Castañares, I'm writing this here in my home of Claypole, 
in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
 This is March 9TH of the year 2K2, today I've decided to make public my creation:

Wolfenstein 3D "Arielus", a Wolfenstein 3D add-on.
 This add-on consists in the classic Wolfenstein 3D Registered V1.1, with the diference 
that the six episodes have been replaced. Every level is mine, from my own brains 
and heart.
 None graphic have been changed, it means that the Vswap.WL6 is the original, as 
the sounds and every little thing that has to do with the whole Wolfenstein 3D.
 I know pretty well that there are many, many add-ons like mine and even far better 
than mine. But, mine's somehow especial because I created it from 1996 to 1998, during 
those years when we could only change the Vswap, the Gamemaps, the Maphead and the 
Audiot. No source code was available then, and there were just a few editors hanging 
around, like WolfEdit, WolfSnd and MapEdit... this last one is the only one I used, 
the version was 4.2, I think.
 Anyway, I personally think my levels are especial, I like them but I really hope 
fans like my from out there like them as I do. I took me a lot of time to do them.

 I've also made Spear Of Destiny "Arielus", which is already online and available 
to be downloaded. This Wolfenstein add-on is named almost the same because my pals 
here gave me the nickname of Arielus; that's where the names of the games come from.

 Well, that's all... I hope you like my levels, and if you haven't tried Spear Of 
Destiny "Arielus", please do so and have fun...
 Please, write to me at spaceraker (at) hotmail.com, I'm willing to receive mails from 
Wolfenstein 3D lovers from the world.
 Farewell... and take care.
