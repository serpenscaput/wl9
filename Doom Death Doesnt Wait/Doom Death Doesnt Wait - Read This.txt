+Weapons+

There are four weapons.

Fist:
Your fist. This is the only weapon 
that you can use if you don't have ammo.
Obliviously this is not too powerful.

Pistol:
Your sidearm, you begin the game bringing this one.
Medium damage and range.
I think you don't use this weapon if you have 
more powerfuls weapons.

Shotgun:
A short range powerful weapon and my favourite.
It take down in one hit also more enemies.
It is not difficult to find.

Chaingun:
A very rapid fire weapon that can transform your 
ammo from 99 to 0 in less than one minute.
A weapon hard to find in the first episode.
