You play the role of B.J's Brother Mark.

This takes place during the TGOEL mod



You came home after the day off you found out B.J. was gone. You sat down and the 
phone rings - you pick it up. "Hello. This is the President." 

"O Hello." 

"Mark this is big news. B.J. went to get the Cup of Christ.  Someone told us that 
the Spear of Dreams was stolen by Nazi's and took it to the Castle out where B.J. 
is. I want you find the Spear of Dreams and bring it back. Sounds fair?"

"Ya."  

"Good, a plane will await you. Good Luck." - When you're on the plane then you jump 
out of the plane and open your parachute... you land on the ground. It is quiet and 
cloudy. You draw your knife and see no one. Good Luck.
