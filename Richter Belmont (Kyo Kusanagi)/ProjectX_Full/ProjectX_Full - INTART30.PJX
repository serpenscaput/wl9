^C7d Chapter 3: Welcome To the Dream World

^C2a This is Thomas, journal date unknown. I think I've made it to the Master of 
Dreams. He snarled at me and stared me down with his evil green eyes. I think this 
is going to be a hard battle. But I must kill him to wake up, so I don't really have 
a choice. End of Log.
