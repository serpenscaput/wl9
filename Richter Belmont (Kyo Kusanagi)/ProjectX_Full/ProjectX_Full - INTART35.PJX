^C7d Chapter 4: The Awakening.

^C2a This is Thomas, journal date January 26th, 2019. Man, it's cold. I had to wake 
up in winter, didn't I? I've walked though the forest to find the base. After hours 
of looking I found it burnt out and full of demons. This is just freaking great. 
[sighs] I hope everyone is OK. End of log.
