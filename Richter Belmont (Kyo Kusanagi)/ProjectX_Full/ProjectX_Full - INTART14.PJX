^C7d Chapter 2: Carmilla's Domain

^C2a This is Thomas, journal date October 16th, 2014. I've just left the sewers, 
and HQ has just contacted me about the strange readings inside of Buckingham Palace. 
 Hmmm, it's only 3 blocks away from here. But there appears to be a vampiric tank 
squad in the way.  I'm screwed unless I find a rocket launcher.  I hope those Vampiric 
Robots have some.  End of Log.
