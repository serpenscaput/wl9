^C7d Chapter 2: Carmilla's Domain

^C2a This is Thomas, journal date October 16th, 2014. London is in ruins.  I guess 
I was too late.  My expedition has led me into a sewer system.  Yuck!  It really 
smells in here, but it's the only way through to the vampiric checkpoint. I'll put 
on my envirosuit to withstand the smell and make sure I don't catch anything from 
this disgusting sludge. End of log.
