^C7d Chapter 5: Searching for Yuki

^C2a This is Thomas, journal date Febuary 2nd, 2019. Its been six days on this damn 
hovercraft. [sighs] It's starting to piss me off a bit, but I'm finally over a forest 
in Romania, and I'm going to jump out and parachute into the forest. It's not the 
graceful exit I'd hoped for, but it's my only choice. End of log.
