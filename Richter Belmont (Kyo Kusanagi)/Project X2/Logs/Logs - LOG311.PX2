^C7d Message To Rain.

^C2a Ahh, Rain. As you are reading this, I am in full control of the Demons living 
around here. I can't wait for our little match to get you back home, but you'll never 
be able to beat me. Even if you did, Edward is undefeatable, you can't win.

^C2a If you want to enter my university, go find and hit three switches, but they 
are guarded by three Dark Knights. Kill them, then enter my university. This is Jason 
out.
