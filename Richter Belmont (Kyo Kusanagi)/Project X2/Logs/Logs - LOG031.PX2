^C7d Hiding The Keys

^C2a Damn it all, why is everyone hiding their keys? I mean, what's the point in 
all of this? Last time, I saw Frank hid his key in the other side of this room. I 
mean, do people really steal stuff in this place? If so, what's the point if people 
are already locked up? End of Log.
