^C7d Data Breach

^C2a The servers have been breached somehow. Some of the data had been stolen from 
an unknown source and we are still trying to figure out, who took the data about 
the Demons and our lord Edmund, too. They are winning this war and with Rain back 
from Hell, things are about to get hairy. End of Log.
