^C7d Lockdown In Effect

^C2a We have managed to contain the outbreak, but a high number of military and science 
personnel has been killed. We cannot risk any further casualties, so this lab sector 
is now under lockdown until further notice. The electric gates are to remain on AT 
ALL TIMES, and a heavy trooper will be posted on guard. Entry is strictly prohibited.
