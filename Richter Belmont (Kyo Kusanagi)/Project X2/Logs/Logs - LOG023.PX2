^C7d Edward's Orders

^C2a Damn it, we were ordered by Edward to put Rain in an extra tight cell, but the 
dumbasses put him in a normal cell, 'cause they thought he would "never escape". 
Now he's free, on the loose to get out of here. Where are the extra men for this? 
Why did Edward sent them to a temple outside from here? Why is it so important there? 
Who knows. End of Log.
