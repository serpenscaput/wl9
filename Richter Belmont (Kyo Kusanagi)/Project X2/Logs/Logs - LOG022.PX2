^C7d Hidden Shotgun

^C2a They just won't shut up about the victory of capturing Rain. For all we know, 
he can escape at anytime he wants. -sighs- Staying in this bathroom is a bad idea 
to do this log. Well, I've hidden my own shotgun from Fred, God knows what he'll 
do with that. I've hidden it in a pushable wall in the dog pen. End of Log.
