^C7d Something In The River

^C2a My buddies and I were bored, so we went fishing by the river today. And what 
did I catch? A freakin' two-headed fish! Yuck. Must be some kind of mutation. No 
doubt, the river has been polluted with something nasty. Benson said it could be 
a "run-off" from the test labs. Guess I won't be going fishing around here anymore.
