^C7dChapter 3: Welcome to Hell

^C2aThis is Rain, journal date Unknown. Looks like a large fortress has been built 
in Hell. Edmund's army has the demons under their control, it looks like they're 
fighting alongside him. I overheard someone said they caught a spy and have sent 
a powerful demon to guard him. Who is this spy? I'm going to find out. End of Log.
