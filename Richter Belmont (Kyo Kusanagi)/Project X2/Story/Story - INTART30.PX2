^C7dChapter 3: Welcome to Hell

^C2aThis is Rain, journal date Unknown. I've found out where they keep the spy, I 
see him crucified with a knife in his chest. It's odd, because there is no blood 
dripping out of him. But as I walk close to him, the big demon, that the guards talked 
about, appeared. It looks like it's wrapped in front of me with fire from both his 
claws. If I'm going to get to the spy, I have to take the demon out first! End of 
Log.
