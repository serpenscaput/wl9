		   FINAL VERSION V 1.3

	Welcome to Schoolenstein 3d, the Wolfenstein 
game that takes place in the schools that I attended: 
Transfiguration Elementary School, and Bishop Hafey 
Jr/Sr High School. These levels are not exactly the way 
the schools look. Since Wolfenstein 3d doesn't have the 
option of making stairs to climb, the places where there
should be stairs, I put false doors. If you come across 
a door you can't open, it's not supposed to.
	Schoolenstein 3d has many graphics 
modifications. There is a realistic looking locker wall
style. If Wolfenstein was more interactive, you'd almost 
think you could walk right up and open it. 
	Level 7 is the Teacher's Hideout level. It is 
done pretty poorly. In levels 8 and 9, you enter a 
different part of the game, the part I call the 
basement. There are blue steel walls and pipes all over 
the place. Also, you might find out that level 9, the 
boss level, is not in fact the boss level. It's filled 
with Guards. just run straight down the hall and don't 
stop. Do not make a sound. The Boss is in this room. 
Once you beat him, you'll just go onto the final level.
The one the game thinks is the boss level.
	Level 10 is the boss level and also a sneek 
peek at a later Spear of Destiny game. The graphics in 
the SoD game will be changed slightly. No biggy there.
	Enjoy playing the game. If there are any 
problems, reach me at the addresses below.
