*Begin Transmission to B. J. Blazcowicz from allied HQ*

***********************Confidential*********************

To Big Bad Wolf
de Little Red Riding Hood,
eliminate threat to U. S. school
Imperative
Complete job within 24 hours
out.

	Ok, Blazcowicz, enough with the secret Morse 
code and all that government crap. Let's get down to 
business. This is your biggest job yet. Those @%*#&! 
Nazis have taken a liking to U. S. soil. There is a 
threat in a small town called Hazleton in Pennsylvania
of Nazi attack. They. . .
	Wait, I'm getting a wire. . . the Nazis have 
attacked. They. . . holy lord, they're attacking a 
High School, an Elementary School, and a Vo-tech! 
We need you now Blazcowicz. This is the stats we have. 
Also, one more thing: The UAC company may be in on this.
We got a hint from a student that said UAC is engraved
in some of the chalkboards.

YOUR WEAPONS
--------------------------------------------------------

Fist- New replacement for the knife. This was inspired 
from a different game. This fist seems to be more 
powerful than the knife. When it is used, you just punch
your target.

Walther P.38 Handgun- Still unchanged from the original
Wolfenstein 3d. This gun rules supreme over all other 
guns in my mind even though it is weak.

DD.44 Dostovei- Supposed to resemble the .44 Russian, 
that is used in the N64 game Goldeneye. It's not the 
best replacement in the world, but it gets the job done.
Sorry about the sound. My sound editor has never worked 
properly.

Chaingun- She's still the same guys. This bute' is the 
original Nazi @$$ kicker. Put away those weak little 
toys and get ready to let fly. 

YOUR ENEMIES
--------------------------------------------------------

The Nazis regulars are up and about. Veterans of 
Wolfenstein will hear the same words hurtled out of 
their mouths as they see you or die.

Dogs- Still the same

NOTES: What is there to say about a dog? They're too 
easy to beat.

Guards- Still the same

NOTES: Whack the guards with something small. I suggest 
using the sword or the Walther P.38.

S. S.- Still the same

NOTES: S. S. still carry the Machine gun. They also 
carry a backup DD.44 which is dropped when he dies. 
S. S. are still as hard to beat as ever.

Hans Grösse- Well, well, well, the principal has 
learned German. Principal Wolfgang Tressler is one tough
cookie to beat. He has dual firing chainguns which fire 
at different times. 

NOTES: Shoot, hide, shoot, hide, shoot, hide.

New Interesting Wall Patterns
--------------------------------------------------------

Lockers, Chalkboards, Blue Steel Walls, Walls W/Pipes,
Grey Brick Walls, Walls W/Vents, Walls W/Tortured Kids.

Y U   DE P-- --  - -   -   - - - -     -   /////////////

	That's it Blazcowicz, I lost the signal. It's up
to you now. Go find those Nazi bucketheads and really 
screw up their day. There are kid's lives at stake. 
One more thing, don't steal anything from the lockers. 
Ha ha ha.
