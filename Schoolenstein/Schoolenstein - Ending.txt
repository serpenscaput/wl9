***************Schoolenstein 3d: Epilouge***************

-------Don't read this if you didn't beat the game------	

	As the battle between you and the Principal went
on, the West Hazleton police arrived at the scene. At 
about 10:35 PM on the night of July 8, 1998, Principal
Wolfgang Tressler breathed his last. You wander around
the school looking for the Spear. 
	Alas, your search proves no good. The Spear is
not there. You walk out of the school and into the 
waiting arms of your wife.
	"Oh, God. Thank God you're safe," She says as 
she kisses and hugs you in the usual manner.
	She pleads with you to resign from the corp, but
you finally speak up and say, "I think this is just the
beginning of this little party. The allies need someone 
like me. I can't resign now."
	You and your wife walk off the scene. You were 
right about one thing, this is just the beginning.
