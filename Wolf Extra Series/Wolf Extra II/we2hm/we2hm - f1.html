			<P>Push the wall in front of you and fight the mutants in the first room.<BR>

			Then continue exploring the floor fighting off enemies coming in from every direction.</P>

			<P>The two central gray rooms have gold key doors, these rooms hold a 1-up and 
the silver key. Someone may open the doors for you but you will still need the gold 
key as well as the silver key to get to the elevator in the southeastern part of 
the floor. The gold key is found in a little room in the blue section. This section 
also holds a 1-up in a secret room. Both keys are heavily guarded by SS behind stationary 
objects. You have to defeat them and note that you will not be able to get any of 
their machine guns.</P>
			<P>When you finally get to the last room in the gray maze section in the southeast 
push the rightmost glass wall to reveal the elevator.</P>
