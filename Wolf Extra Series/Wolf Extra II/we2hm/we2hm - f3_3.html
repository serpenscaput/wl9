			<P>When you get to the next set of armours you are on the other side of the pushwall 
near the chaingun. If you didn't get the chaingun earlier remove this pushwall southward 
blocking the original path. Mutants will come at you, go through the unlocked door 
to the south and have them follow you through the locked one. Shoot them in the doorway 
past the skeletons. If you have shot all these mutants previously you can move further 
south and alarm some enemies in one of the purple/green rooms and have them perform 
the trick. Any remaining enemy in the areas that you have been through may possibly 
also fix it.</P>
			<P>If you enter the big room with the three Ubermutants in the southwest corner 
you definitely need to have a chaingun. You can get into this room past a Dead Guard 
Trick at the south end. To get out again you need the silver key found in this room. 
To get this key you need to push a wall block. You will probably have to kill at 
least one Ubermutant before you can start thinking about performing this action.
