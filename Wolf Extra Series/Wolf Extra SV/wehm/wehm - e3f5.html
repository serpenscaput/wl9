			<P>A quiet opening. Get the ammo in the secret room. Passing the wooden barrel 
you may hear a familiar greeting. In this level too there are two ways of getting 
the Gold Key. Battle a whole army in the big south-western room, or defeat a Grosse 
in a secret area in the north-east. A pushwall by the blue wall leads into some parts 
of this area, if you have a chaingun you can try to beat Grosse past the column, 
but you may run out of ammo. Find the pushwall near the entrance. Pass through the 
green barrels fighting off the officers (if you have not dealt with them already). 
Push the block in the next room and open the door, that is if Grosse is not already 
coming through it. Get the chaingun and the ammo, fight him running around the purple 
block. With the Gold Key you can get the 1-up in this area. Fight your way to the 
south-west, here you can go by the outer corridor if you have the Gold Key. But of 
course you will want to fight all those enemies even if you don't have to. A 1-up 
is in the red room. Make it through the vines with the mutants. Get the Silver Key 
in the panel section and find the short cut back. Enter the last room before the 
elevator.</P>
