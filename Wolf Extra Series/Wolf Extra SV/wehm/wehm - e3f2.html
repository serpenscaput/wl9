			<P>It's heavy action from the start. Shoot the guards, grab the ammo, then deal 
with the SS. Now you have a machine gun.</P>
			<P>You will be attacked from every possible angle on your way to the Silver Key 
found behind the pushwall and the column in the south-eastern corner of the floor. 
A 1-up is found in the room in the south-western corner. In the secret room not far 
from the entrance is another set of pushwalls that let you pass through the wooden 
barrels in the central hallway. Prepare for a hard fight getting into the main eastern 
section, the Gold Key is found in one of the northern rooms of this area. Then you 
make it for the elevator.</P>
