			<P>Nothing but dry wells, dead plants and skeletons make up the surroundings on 
this terrifying floor. Eliminate the 4 mutants. Behind a pushwall you see into a 
gloomy apparently empty area, pick up the machine gun and proceed by another pushwall. 
Things seem quiet, but in the south-eastern area it starts. Open the door and shoot 
the first mutants, but don't hang around. Your only chance of survival is to be on 
the move. Run past the blocks, shoot the mutants in your way and pick up the ammo. 
Finish quickly with the guards in the next hallway. Then find your way to the south-east 
and get the Silver Key and the 1-up. Find yourself engaged in more heavy fighting 
behind the silver key door. Soon you will find the elevator. But there is a door 
in the corner leading south into more sinister areas. Behind a secret door you enter 
deeper into the eerie purple brick structures. You know the Dead Guard Trick by now, 
ah! at least there's a chaingun. Then you freeze!... Find the Gold Key to get to 
areas with more power-ups. 1-ups are found behind pushwalls. Behind Schabbs is an 
alternate entrance to the elevator.</P>
