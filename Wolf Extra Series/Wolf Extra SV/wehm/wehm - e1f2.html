			<P>Clear the main hallways, then get the Gold Key.</P>
			<P>There are SS in some of the rooms, but they are behind stationary objects.<BR>

			To get hold of a machine gun as well as some treasure you must get past pushwalls.<BR>

			The best way is to kill the SS at spots where they won't block the pushwalls,<BR>

			it is still a little difficult though.</P>
			<P>Grab as much treasure as you can plus the Silver Key and head on towards the 
elevator.</P>
