			<P>In the big and medium sized levels you start in an elevator room. And that 
is also the fact on this floor.</P>
			<P>But where is the elevator? Well it's right there.<BR>
			The many Fake Hitlers indicate that this level is not really what it seems.</P>

			<P>The Gold Key is found in the south-western corner, and the Silver Key in the 
south-eastern one.<BR>
			Pick up all the powerups and treasure you find.</P>
