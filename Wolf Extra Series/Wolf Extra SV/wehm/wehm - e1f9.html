			<P>You start in the same outdoor area in which you found the elevator on the previous 
floor.<BR>
			This level offers a lot choices of moving making it develop differently each time 
you play it.<BR>
			There are only guards and officers in the first areas. If you are without a machine 
gun, there is one in the secret area in the northern part of the floor, accessed 
from the red brick section. A 1-up is found inside the blue maze.<BR>
			After a lot of varied action you will get to the grey brick section in the south-eastern 
area. The Silver Key is hidden behind the green barrels.<BR>
			After clearing the south-western area don't forget the chaingun behind the pushwall 
if you not already have one. You will need it.<BR>
			Then you confront Hans Grosse. Get to the ammo and health and start running around 
the parallel walls while fighting him. Once he is defeated you take the Gold Key 
and enter the next room. Only to meet another Grosse! Get him out of the room and 
push the wall by the 1-up for more ammo. Fight him till he is defeated or you run 
out of ammo. Then make it to the exit.</P>
