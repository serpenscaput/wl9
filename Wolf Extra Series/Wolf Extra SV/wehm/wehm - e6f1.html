			<P>The opening to this episode is very hard. Open the door and then run to the 
left or right picking up ammo. Get through the door in either of the corners, position 
yourself with your back against the wall next to the door so that you don't get hit 
neither by the SS behind the barrels nor by the officers behind the columns. Shoot 
the guards and rush through the health and ammo, then take on the guards in the next 
room. Be aware that the guards in the other section will be following you. It can 
be a good idea to try to finish with all the SS though it may cost you a lot. But 
forget about finding a secret passage into their rooms to get a machine gun. You 
need more pistol practicing! Push a wall next to a column ahead of the entrance to 
get the Gold Key plus some health and treasure, but look out for the officers. Move 
by the north section and by a pushwall, battle the officers by the elevator. The 
Silver Key will let you into the big officer's room.</P>
