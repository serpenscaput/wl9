			<P>Enter the third section. Be on your guard! Find a 1-up plus ammo in a secret 
room. Then make it past the officers in the outdoor area. The terrifying aspect of 
this area indicates that you are moving in for the final terrible battle. Fight the 
last officers, notice a 1-up and ammo behind columns. Then you pass through the door 
to the fourth section. This will be the last time you see the Dead Guard Trick. Push 
the block of no retreat. Then enter the maze. Locate the secret areas you have seen. 
You may try to find the powerups plus the 1-up at the south end, but the mutants 
have located you. You fight them bravely but they come from everywhere. You move 
deeper into the vines, they track you down. There's another turn, you back into it 
firing to keep them off. DIE ALLIED SCHVEINHUND! Brazen it out at short range. Turn 
a corner, he's coming after you. Deliver another blast and turn the next, don't forget 
the mutants. Soon you are desperately looking for the powerups, the menacing sound 
behind you. When at last, his armour broken, you're down to your last. Again you 
move into the vines to confront the hidden fiend.	<A HREF=e3f9.html>back</A></P>
