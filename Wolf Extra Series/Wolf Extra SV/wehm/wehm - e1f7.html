			To get the Gold Key move straight forward from where you start.<BR>
			Then you venture into the southern parts.<BR>
			The Silver Key is hidden near the central room and so is a 1-up.<BR>
			Try to shoot as many as possible in the central room past the column or the well 
by the treasure.<BR>
			Then take out the rest on your way to the elevator. You have to push a wall block 
in the central room.</P>
