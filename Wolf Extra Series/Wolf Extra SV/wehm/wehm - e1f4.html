			<P>If you still don't have a machine gun this will be tough.<BR>
			Get one as quickly as possible, then go for the Gold Key.</P>
			<P>This level is the first where you come across my "Poet's Dead Guard Trick", 
getting you locked into a new area. If you enter the maze without having picked up 
the Gold Key, you have to find a secret passage back to the main hallway.</P>
			<P>Clear the room in front of the elevator, get the Silver Key and move back through 
the short cut in the north-eastern part of the floor. But prepare for some more fighting.<BR>

			Push the block with the sign and get to the elevator.</P>
