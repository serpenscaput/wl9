Storyline:

The year is 1944. Captain William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz has just been recruited by the United States Army in an alternate timeline where the Nazis have been moving further forward without the intervention of Blazkowicz to complete the project Eisenfaust. For this project, Hitler has planned a new war, dubbed the Giftkrieg. Instead of using normal infantry/artillery, he has planned using super chemical weapons. These weapons are many times stronger than normal bombs or explosives, because they use certain chemical ingredients. If these weapons are successfully used, and the plan is executed, the Allies could be crippled and destroyed, permanently.Already the chemical bombs are loaded, and the Nazi Party continues to grow with new technological advancements of astonishing feats. Already the biological departments have worked to create horrendous unions of flesh and gears, and with plenty of funding the research groups have created massive computers able to generate thought and perform extremely complex equations. Weaponry has advanced, and with it the Third Reich grows to massive power, waiting to strike out and easily crush its opponents as soon as shipping of the new weapons, bombs and technology to the German armies begin.

Chapter 1: Entrance

Blazkowicz, after only a month of training after his recruitment, is assigned to a stealth reconnaissance mission of extreme importance. He is to infiltrate the many conglomerates of Nazi bunkers spread across the new capital of Germany, and find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust. He is brought in using fake shipment trucks and escapes to the first bunker. Armed only with a combat knife and a gas mask, he slips through a set of pillars, stabs a guard and now stand over the dead guard's body, grabbing frantically for his gun. He retrieves it, and turns back to look from whence he came. In the heart of Nazi Germany, at the entrance of one of many massive bunkers of the most powerful army in the world, Blazkowicz has only a knife, a gun, and an urge to find the plans and defeat the Nazis for good. However, he must race against time in order to stop the Nazi army and save the world for good.

Chapter 2: Operation: Grabgrabbener

At the time of Blazkowicz's second mission, taking place in an adjacent bunker only moments after the first mission, the first wave of chemical war is already underway. Nearby European counties already lie in ruins, slowly taken over by huge endless armies of Nazis with the ability to first release gasses across the nation using only a few powerful bombs then clean the air using machines. The death counts are staggeringly high, and he future looks bleak as the second wave of shipments, a much larger load, is to reach the Nazi army. 

Dr. Schabbs, the head of the new bio-tech Nazi department, has created a mutant army made of captured, now undead soldiers and civilians. Using muscle enhancers and tons of robot technology, he can take dead bodies and resurrected them into new, brainless zombies. These new mutants are ultra strong, and are virtually limitless to create. They could easily lead the war, and already you have discovered that upon the destruction of a single solider it begins to repair itself. Now, in the heavily guarded fortress of Erlangen, the plans for the second half of the current Giftkrieg (or Poison War) lay out in the open, guarded by swarms of loyal Nazi forces and mechanical mutants alike. Blazkowicz has managed to partially delay the speed of the Nazi power by retrieving the first set of plans, and now must race for the second set in hopes of saving the world from mass destruction.

Chapter 3: Operation: Sturmwind

One bunker to the next. Now, Blaztowikcz must keep his wits about him. The big kahuna is just around the corner! The allies have already found the location of the research and laboratories of these weapons. Blaztowickz must travel to that place, and destroy any more continuing research and production. You must also kill the scientist behind the matter, Otto Giftmatcher.

Chapter 4: Deep Bunkers

Old enemies return! The technology is too powerful now. The Nazi army is seconds form shipment, and the massive Höhepunkt will happen any second now. Closer and closer to the final set of plans, Blaztowikcz must find these as quickly as possible. Only one fake shipment truck remains, the rest discovered and destroyed. With the Nazi forces on full alert with so much destruction at the height of their reign, the armies are on full alert and are being pulled back to find the bug in their system. Blaztowikcz will surely be crushed by the marching armies. The bunkers are so close to the capitol, he can almost hear Hitler echoing through the halls in his angry, booming voice. Hurry, hurry, the fate of the world depends upon you!

Chapter 5: Closer to the End

It is done. The plans have been taken. Left alone in the center of the Nazi capital, armies swarming in to find him, Blaztowikcz sits defeated in the long elevator rides moving up, down, left and right. There is something still here, however, and the time grows nigh. Blaztowikcz must discover the hidden horror behind the blue whirring walls of techno-Germany. It feels so close now, the true purpose of this mission in his head.

Chapter 6: Denker

The final bunker, located so secretly from all the others, abandoned and only filled now with the first scouts of the army, feels cold and dark as the heart of the Nazi regime should. It is here. Find it, Blaztowikcz, and complete your destiny. They will crush you, but then they will be crushed in their haste. End World War 2, and let these nations of good enter the peace you will create for them. The utopias of tomorrow will already hail your name, as America and Britain and China begin new progressive eras and technology booms. The world will float on a metal cloud of peace, so now complete yours. Find the end. Find it.
