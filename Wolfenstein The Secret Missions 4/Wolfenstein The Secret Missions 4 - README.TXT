Classified information (Background information on Orich Goonkastle)*************************


Name:Orich Katsull Goonkastle
DOB:03-17-1922
Rank:General

  Orich Katsull Goonkastle,twin brother of Jurich Wilhelm Goonkastle,is a man of 
the third
reich who has a twisted obsession with death.Before Hitler promoted him to captain,he 
was
a leading member of one of the SS paranormal teams.In early 1943,he studied tales 
of some
type of undead armies and has even been performing bizarre rituals in which he was

resurrecting soldiers back from the grave.Hitler feared that he could become too 
powerful  
and ordered Heinrich Himmler himself,to put an end to his occultic ceremonies.

  With the occult taken away from him,he studied how to resurrect fallen soldiers 
with a 
more scientific approach,geneticly.During operation:Eisenfaust,dr. Schabbs taught 
him and
his brother Jurich how to create the undead mutants which would surely win them the 
war.
Unfortunately the 3 of them didn't expect that B.J. Blazkowicz would be as much as 
a
professional soldier as he is,and so he put an end to Schabbs,and operation:Eisenfaust.


  Shortly after the death of Schabbs,the twins started to study on how to alter a 
human's
genes.In their studies they found out how to increase human's muscle structure by 
89%,a 
remarkable discovery.However,by doing so their human subjects would feature a number 
of side
effects starting from glowing blood shot eyes,and insanity,and ending at uncontrollable

violent behaviors.They named these soldiers das uber soldats,meaning the super soldiers.


  After the death of Hitler,the Goonkastle twins promised to keep the third reich 
alive in
their 2 bases of operations.Orich will be in charge of a mountain base on the german 
and 
austrian border,and to have him along with 3 other generals to occupy it.Heinrich 
Wolfgang,
Josef Weirsauf,and his big brother Von were the generals he had chosen to guard this 
base of
his.The other base that is commanded by Jurich is located 15 miles north of Fagernes 
in
Norway,but Jurich's base of operations is a different story.
