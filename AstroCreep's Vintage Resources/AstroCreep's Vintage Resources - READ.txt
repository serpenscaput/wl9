ASTROCREEP'S VINTAGE RESOURCE PACK

This is a giant pack of PNG images ripped from most of my vintage mods,
dating from between 1998-2006.  Not much of super value in here,
but there are some cool things like a few weapons and walls, as well
as some early MS Paint edits of mine, which are always good for a laugh lol.
Stuff was ripped with WDC directly to WAD file, so if these things should
be used with DOS/SDL Wolf projects they will need to be converted to BMP 
and the sprites need to have a 64x64 image boundary size.  I may do a straight
BMP rip later on.
