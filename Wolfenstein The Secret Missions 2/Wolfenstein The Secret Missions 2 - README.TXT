Classified information (Story)**************************************************************


After defeating Josef Weirsauf and his personal guards,you ran to the elevators that 
go up 
to the next areas of the fortress.With a low ammo count and both guns overheated,you 
dump 
them at the side of Josef Weirsauf's dead body seeing how those weapons won't do 
you any 
good anymore.Now you have to rearm yourself.The elevator stops at the next floor 
and so 
you unsheath your knife once again,now knowing that the guns overheat so soon after 
the 
generals die,you think to yourself that your going to need to use the knife more 
often then
you thought before.
