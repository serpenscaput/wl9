WEX60 Hint
Book
Document version: 1.0a
Written by The Torpid Rodriguez
in 2020.2
This document contains information about the Extreme 60 maps, which is an
unofficial Wolfenstein-3D level package.
The legendary Wolfenstein-3D have created by id Software in 1992.
The WEX60 levels have created by me between 2009 and 2020 with the great
ChaosEdit! www.chaos-software.de.vu .
I started studying Wolfenstein levels with CE in 2009. Back then I just wanted
to create one level. Then I made two more levels, and I ended up with a whole
episode. Then I decided to make even more. And by now, I have finished with
all sixty levels.
Note: I had no intention of making changes in the executable. I have designed
my levels to work with the original program. Therefore the Extreme 60 level
pack is Secret Level Return Path compatible with the original Wolfenstein-3D.
Please don't play with “Can I play, Daddy?" or “Don't
hurt me.” difficulty: You will be bored, and I will
be pissed!
Legend:
h: the key is hidden
L: this key is necessary to complete this level
S: this key is necessary to go to the secret level(s)
!: yes
-: no

L4 For the first part, and for the last: Just go forward, follow the path! Good luck!
L5 Monsters are in stasis. They are unable to use their gun now, even after you woke them up. Destroy
them ‘till not too late! After that you must find the hidden silver key! Good luck!
L6 The frightened Nazis barricaded themselves with crazy stuff they found, while others fled by walling
down the path behind them. You must find the hidden gold key to complete this level! You must alert a
certain officer in area “A” to alert his twin in area “B” to unblock an essential pushwall in area “B”.
Don’t worry! It’s just an insider information. Good luck!
L7 You must find the hidden silver key first. Good luck!
L8 You must find the hidden gold key first. Beware! Ghosts cannot be killed.. Good luck!
BL The Boss lurks almost at the center of the map. He has the gold key for his office, but you need to find
the silver key too. Good luck!
If you are unfamiliar with the Wolfenstein-3D world, or just want to get used to it, you can
see below the simplified maps for the first episode, except the secret level. The grey areas on
the maps are the corridors and rooms where you can move. White rectangle around a wall on
a map means that wall is a pushwall. You can push it with the Use key, the same key with
which you used to open the doors. The white “E” means an end-of-episode trigger, the level
and the episode will be completed if you step on one. (No soldiers, monsters, dogs, food,
treasure items, and other non-blocking items have marked. I’ve also omitted floor codes and
direction markings. I redrawn all markings to make them identifiable for those who are
unfamiliar with CE.):4

L1 You must find the hidden silver and gold keys to complete this level. The final elevator is hidden. You
can check the map E5-M1 on page 14. Good luck!
L2 You must find the hidden path to proceed to the center of the level. Good luck! Note: Max secret is 66%
here, sorry!
L3 Memorize the site of the door you walk out of because you must go back exactly there! The other doors
just for demons! Good luck!
L4 Don't let you killed by the grey monsters! Attack them from behind! To do this, you will need the silver
key, which is in the labyrinth. This labyrinth can't be just walked through with the well-serving alwaysturn-left method. Be strenuous! (Or do whatever you want.) Good luck!
L5 You must find the hidden silver OR the hidden gold key to complete this level. You also have to be
"lucky" to find the hidden gold key. When you see "Verboten", it says: Paranormal danger ahead! Turn
back, and don’t come back until you almost finished the level. You can check the map E5-M5 on page
14. Good luck! Note: Max secret is 83% here, sorry!
SL Good luck!
L6 You must find the hidden silver key to complete this level. The final elevator is hidden. You will have
one extra life at the beginning of the level, and two med kits awaiting you after you acquired the gold
key. These three are the only health items on this level! Use bullets rather than being hit! Good luck!
L7 Be smart! Good luck!
L8 The final elevator is hidden. This level contains a puzzle. If you proceed without solving the puzzle, you
will be killed in seconds, Mr. Blazkowicz! (Except in baby mode.) (Unfortunately, those demonic
smokes sometimes break out spontaneously, so it is advisable to save often in different slots to be able
to continue the game when this occurs.) Also, you should save your game at the beginning of the level,
and keep it untouched! You can check the puzzle in E5-M8 on page 15. Good luck! Please ignore the
secret score here!
BL Shoot Schabbs! Good luck!13

L1 You must find the hidden gold key and the hidden gold key door to complete this level. Good luck!
Please ignore the secret score here!
L2 You can check the map E6-M2 on page 15. Good luck!
L3 Follow the guard! If you do it too tightly, you will be noticed. But if you lag behind the guard, the door
will slap before you. Good luck! Please ignore the secret score here!
SL Surprise! This is the right place but not the right time. Believe or not, this is the final Boss level, but in
its earlier stage! Sludge break is a minor problem now. Since you are here, improve the opportunity,
and look around before you come back again! Good luck!
L4 You must find the hidden gold key to complete this level. Good luck!
L5 A huge labyrinth. Use the silver key maze doors as a shortcut when you want to go back to the silver
key door located in the first room. You can check the map E6-M5 on page 16. Good luck!
L6 Beside the silver key, you must find the hidden gold key to complete this level. As you get the gold key,
something startling will happen: Your silver and gold keys will merge together, and you will have only
one bronze key that will open EVERY DOOR. Good luck! You will need it.
L7 **You shouldn’t open every pushwall on this level. If you push the wrong wall, you will be chased by
demons. Check the map E6-M7 on page 16. Good luck! (Besides, if you not open all pushwall, your
secret ratio will not be 100%. I will not blame you.)
L8 Good luck!
BL Hitler is lurking somewhere near here now... Halt Hitler! You can check the map E6-M9 on page 17.
Good luck!
