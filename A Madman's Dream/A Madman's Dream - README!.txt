                       by John Bucksnort


    Welcome to the dream... a nightmare of madness and carnage unequaled anywhere
but in the mind of Adolf Hitler...He is plenty pissed off too...You destroyed the 
fuel depot at Tobruk and took all his treasure and The Spear too!! Now he has a big time
attitude problem! But controlling him is the face of the Ultimate evil...You have to
blast your way through 10 more levels of his bloodthirsty guards and minions to discover the
maniacal force behind him...One more of those stinky, nasty castles that Hitler always seems
to find and hide in....Find him, toast him and then on to the final level to get the evil 
thing that controls him.....Good luck!

     Beware, for there are many traps, tunnels of no return, and 1 way passages...there are dozens
of pushwalls and fake tunnels...Some exits are in secret areas, and some are out in 
the open....it won't be easy...it won't be pretty, but if you make it all the way to level 10,
you will have felt like you have been thrashed, for combat is never pretty or easy...
GOOD LUCK and HAVE FUN!!...............................John
