^C[Green]An ECWolf Mod for Super 3D Noah's Ark





^C[Red]KICKING ALIEN ASS - BIBLICAL STYLE

^G 16 16 [M_CURS1]
^C[Red]The Story - ANCIENT ALIENS?!?!




^C00It was a very rough few days for Noah.  Tending to all of those anxious animals 

was starting to wear down on him.  After building himself a pimp new pad, 
Noah was ready to take a very well deserved nap.  However, just as he was about to 
doze off, 
he hears a strange noise in the distance...
^P


^C00Suddenly!  A light!  Right over the mountains and getting closer!  
Before Noah knows it, bright beams fill his house and yard!  
Before long the entire yard is infested with ugly weird looking beings!!!!!
They seem to be wearing some strange metallic clothing, and are carrying mysterious 

magical weapons.  Noah looks out his window and is appalled!!!!  
^P

^C00Some of them seem to be sodomizing the livestock with metallic doo-dads!  For 
what?!?  
WHY?!?!  What is this blasphemy!!!!  God cursed the planet with the flood to 
rid the world of monstrosities such as these!!!!  This has to be the work of the 
Devil.
Luckily, it seems that the animals' feed is corrosive to the beasts' flesh!  As
God's only soldier, it is up to you, Noah, to rid your house of these heathens 
and finally get that gosh-darned nap!!!!!
^P
^G 16 16 [L_BJWINS]
^C[Red]ABOUT ^C[Green]NOAHPAK

^c00This monstrosity is a mod for Super 3D Noah's Ark!  As far as I know, this is 
the first of
its kind - an ECWolf mod for S3DNA, enhanced with new enemies, weapons, and lots 
of other 
fun stuff!  This mod started out as a level mod for S3DNA and morphed into 
this fucked up adventure about Noah cleansing the Earth of evil sheep-fucking aliens!

^P
^c00The point of this game is to rid your poorly-planned, over-sized house 
(It was built from the remnants of the Ark, you know...why do you think there are 
no ruins?)
of aliens, and then infiltrate their ship to destroy the remaining invasion forces 
and 
the battle computer! However, the animals from the ark haven't moved far from where 

the ark landed yet, and they are pretty freaked out by all this invasion stuff, so 
you must 
feed them to distract them from this anarchy!
^P
^G 16 16 [M_CURS1]
^C[Red]The Invaders





^c00These are the ugly bastards that have come to rain on God's parade.  
The only thing these creatures will understand is a deadly handful 
of corrosive feed!
^P
^G 16 16 [GRUNT]






^C[Red]Grunt


^c00These little green shits are the main invasion force, aka bullet bait.  They 

carry laser rifles, and have no problems zapping you out of the picture to 
rape this world of resources!
^P
^G 16 16 [CAPTAIN]






^C[Red]Captain


^c00These seem to be the commanders on the battlefield.  They are much bigger and 
faster than their underlings,
and have heavy duty laser cannons ready to blast you to smithereens!
^P
^G 16 16 [TROLL]






^C[Red]Troll


^c00Bioengineered by the invaders, these things live only to eat.  To make things 
worse, they puke up plasma balls.
Joy.
^P
^G 16 16 [BLOBOID]






^C[Red]Bloboid


^c00A native species of the invaders' home planet.  Ugly, smelly green piles of flesh 
eating snot.  They also
split when killed! The only way to destroy them is to keep smashing them until they 
are liquid piles of goo!
^P
^G 16 16 [OVERLORD]






^C[Red]Overlord


^c00These things are the architechts of the attack.  These are the most battle hardened 
warriors 
this side of the Milky Way! These guys guard key areas of the ship.
^P
^C[Red]ALSO INCLUDES
^G 32 16 [WHISKEY]
^P
^G 32 125 [NOAHDEMO]
^c00This serves as sort of a prequel. After building his pimp new pad, Noah is ready 
to kick back and drink some whiskey. However, he finds that Melvin the Monkey has 
stolen his whiskey! To make matters worse, he's gone and hid in a cave somewhere, 
probably to hog the whole thing to himself!!!!! Not to mention the fact that he has 
amassed a small army of his snobby followers, ready to stand in between Noah and 
his buzz! Go get your whiskey back from that stinky ape!
