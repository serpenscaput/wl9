	---STORY---

		You are awoken by the sharp sound of a train whistle, a great contrast to the low rumble of 
	the locomotive chugging down the track. You have no issue opening your eyes, considering you 
	can't see anything anyways. Moments later the train seems to come to a screeching halt, and 
	yells from Germans are hardly heard through the cold steel. The door is yanked open 
	and a breeze flows in. Before you have a chance to react you are thrown from the train car onto
	the dirt. 
		As you look around the environment. Germans are everywhere. Herding these people into 
	buildings like sheep. It's hard to focus. A rancid smell eminates from a building to your left, 
	and former men and women are being sorted and dehumanized. One group sent to the "Labor," one 
	sent to the "Arbeitsbereich," and one sent to the "Entsorgung," like hell I know what it means. 
	They "Don't deserve names." Disgusting. When the guards aren't looking you sneak under a train 
	carraige to the other side. 
		As you fumble to your feet and rub your chin, a German engineer 
	turns around, and his eyes open wide, realizing the situation, "Halt! Du solltest nicht wieder
	hier sein!" Looks like we aren't welcome here. You grab a wrench from his toolkit and swing it 
	fullforce towards his head. With a crunch and a splatter his jaw hit the floor. Didn't even have
	a chance. You rummage through the various pouches and pockets in his uniform. "Nothin'." This 
	facility needs to be taken care of, but I need to get back to allied heaquarters. Turning to the right, you 
	discover a pistol sitting on a crate. "This'll come in handy." You top off 
	the clip, cock back the slide...
	
	And get psyched.

	---DISGUISE-MECHANICS---
	
	In level 4, you have successfully gained an officer's uniform, and using the documents you discovered 
	on the Conductor's corpse, you learn that boarding the U-423 and travelling to a base miles away 
	will be the only way back to the frontlines. 
	
	Press 6 on your keyboard to bring up your papers. SS guards will stand in front of vital doors you
	will need to gain access to. Another type of sentry sits behind a glass wall. They require the highest
	clearance possible, 3rd level, and can't be killed. Flash your papers and if you have the correct level, they will
	let you pass. Giving them the wrong papers won't make them raise the alarm though. Just be sure to take
	a good look around and don't be afraid to pick off a few special targets on your way. Taking out your 
	weapon will alert any enemies that can see you, and while it's out your disguise is useless.
	
	---LEVEL-8---
	An SAS force has been dispatched to rescue you, but you don't need rescuing. You've got a job to do.

	Alarms will be tripped after a certain amount of time after being alerted. Shoot them!
