Escape From The Labyrinth v0.9b
===============================
levels by Jordan Buck

Yeah, I know it's a crappy name. But it works because there's a lot of mazes
in these levels. Uh-huh. Anyway, for the most part they're in the style of
the original Wolfenstein levels. No walking through walls, no elevators or
keys stuck behind secret doors (besides secret ones), and in general they're
of quality design. They *are* a bit on the hard side, but it gets boring when
it's two Stormtroopers per level. And the mazes are on the easy side if you
know what you're doing.

Episode 1 is complete, 100%, but Episode 2 only has the first level. If you
go on to the next level you'll just be in a little hallway with an End Game
trigger set up (for completeness). There's no new sounds or graphics, just
some levels that are entertaining to play and actually work.
