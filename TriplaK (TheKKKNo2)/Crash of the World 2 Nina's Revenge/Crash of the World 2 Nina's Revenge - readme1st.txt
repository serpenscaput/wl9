role
and now she is the new leader of the Neo Corp. The USA army sends BJ's close friend,

JB, to eliminate Nina, and end the madness once for all! 

3. Gameplay

The gameplay is Exactly the same as in COTW1, nothing has changed. You mission is 
to go
through Cortex's Castle again, as BJ did, and kill all enemies behind you, loot treasures,

find secret walls. You will find familiar places from the first game! What more can 
i
say........Bring' em on!

4. Guide

4.1 Weapons

Knife - Basic weapon, no ammo needed for this, but weak against stronger enemies.

Luger P08 - Re-used from World War 2, nothing special about this.
FG42 - Germany rifle, works great on all enemies, even some bosses!
Chaingun - The ultimate killing machine! This weapon can take out everything, but 
uses
many bullets, so watch out while firing with it!

4.2 Enemies

Tribesman - Basic guard of the Castle. Wears a spear with a built-in pistol. Easy 
to
take out.

Elite Guard - Stronger than the Tribesman, he wears a bulletproof suit, and an FG42.


Shepherd Dog - Weak enemy, only one knife hit, and they're killed instantly.

Beavis - Wears a pistol, very similar than the Tribesman, but he have more health, 
and
fires rapidly!

Mutant - Cortex's previously created mutants, they can be very dangerous! Be carefull!


Lab Assistant - Fires white electronic balls, that can seriously damage you! Strafing

and shooting will works.

Eddy - Armed with a Chaingun, Eddy is one of the hardest enemies to kill. Make sure

you have very high amount of ammo and health, unless he can shoot you down easily!


4.3 Bosses

Boss 1: Pinstripe - Nina's weapon expert Henchmen. He is less stronger than Eddy, 
but
have more health.

Boss 2: General Strassenmeister - Nina's right-handman. He has a rocket launher. 
Not
so difficulty to kill him, but he's also being sorrounded by some mutants!

Boss 3: Hans Grosse - Highly ranked soldier, armed with two chainguns, followed with 
two
rocket launchers.

Boss 4: Nina Cortex - The new leader of Neo Corp., she is pretty strong, so better 
be
carefull!

As in the first game, COTW2 also contains a secret level (Floor 19), but instead 
of a Nina
clone, this level contains a secret boss! Of course, this level again can be accesed 

from level 10.
