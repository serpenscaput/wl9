Project: Wolfenstein
By NT Games (TheKKKNo2)

This is my early Wolfenstein 3D Mod, started back in around february-march 2011 (Under 
my previous nick name, kkk911XD).
This mod was cancelled in 2012, since i thought, i've lost the mod.
But in september 2013, i've found a disk, that contained this mod. Of course, i was 
so happy :) After that, i quickly copied the mod to my computer, re-wamped to SDL 
format (Since the original was would be made in DOS version), and released, as you 
can see!

This mod contains a full episode, with 10 levels.
These levels are not very good, compared to my never mod's levels, but back then, 
i didn't have much mapping skills.

Installation & play:

1. Extract PrjWolf.zip into any empty folder
2. To play it, click Wolf4SDL.exe

Have fun! I hope you like it! :)
