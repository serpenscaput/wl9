Author's notes:
This is a Cristmas-themed mod, inspired by Bob and Adrienne's Xmas Wolf and Reactor's 
(unreleased
at the time) Christmas Eve. It also includes some elements of Ringman's The Night 
after Christmas
mod. I've pretty much loved both mods (i hope some day Reactor will release Christmas 
Eve, because
it looks very promising!), so i've mixed it all together to make a little surprise 
to all my
guests on our webpage/Facebook page & group, and of course to my YouTube viewers!
