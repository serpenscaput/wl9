     The nightmare will never end. The story of the hideous mutants will never end. 
Here in the fourth segment,
you will encounter more of Schabb's nasty creations. This time, they seem to have 
a real attitude problem too.  They have infested an old stinky castle with all kinds 
of secret rooms, and twisty halls full of surprise ambushes. The surprises they have 
in store for you aren't too pleasent either. Be on the watch, for these things come 
out of "nowhere". Your mission is to escape alive...and with all your body parts 
intact. You dont have a large supply of ammo lying around, so be sure to pick up 
all you can...you'll need it! There is some first aid, but not much, so be on the 
watch. Have a wonderful trip through
these 6 levels and hopefully I'll see you on the other "side"...
