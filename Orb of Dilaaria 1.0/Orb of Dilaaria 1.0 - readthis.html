It has been optimized in hopes of providing an enjoyable experience on a variety 
of computers.
By default, all options except "Show FPS" are enabled.
If the game performs poorly, try disabling "Shading/Fog" first, then try disabling 
"Sky", "Clouds", and "Textured Flats" one at a time until gameplay is acceptable.</p>

<b><u>Story</u></b><br>

<p>The Land of the Seven Kingdoms was once the peaceful creation of Eilior, the Great 
Being.
There were nine lesser beings who served as council to Eilior called the Nonacyclus.

Among them was Wersin, the deceiver, who left the council to descend upon the world 
thus shattering its peace.
For protection, Eilior gave man the gift of the Orb, which strengthens the weapons 
of the Seven Kingdoms.
However, as a weapon becomes further from the Orb, its power wanes.
The elders of the Seven Kingdoms met and declared that the Orb be kept within the 
castle of Dilaaria, since it was nearest the center of all the lands.
However, this left the southern-most land, Drami-on, without the power of the Orb.</p>


<p>The dark clouds of war covered the land as Wersin's henchmen swarmed the countryside.

For many years the Seven Kingdoms have kept the lands safe, but recent sightings 
suggest that a great army is rising against them from the south.
According to scouts, Wersin has ravaged the lands of Drami-on and stolen their enchanted 
weapons to equip a massive army.</p>

<p>As a royal guard for King Hylorn, ruler of Dilaaria, you have been ordered to 
guard the Orb's chamber.
From deep within the castle, you only hear muffled sounds as they echo down the hallways 
toward you.
One voice cuts through the jumbled mess:  "The enemy approaches!"  You listen as 
the soft murmur rises to the panicked chatter of war.
The Dark Army of Wersin has arrived.</p>

<p>Torches dot the fields around the castle.
Soon arrows are loosed from all directions.
Ladders spring from the ground and the twisted deformities of the Dark Army have 
soon breached the wall.
The knights of the Seven Kingdoms fight valiantly but to no avail.
You prepare for battle as you hear the main gates burst open.</p>

<p>Thirty or more demonic beings charge down the hallway toward you and the other 
royal guards.
You are soon surrounded by them.
The ten of you are no match for the constant flow of demons and the other guards 
soon fall dead at your side.
A sharp blow to the back of your head sends you sprawling to the ground.
As your vision begins to dim, you see the demons smash the door leading to the Orb's 
chamber...</p>

<p>You awake surprised to see that you're still alive.
You look around and discover that you are in a small dungeon cell littered with bones 
and fleshy debris.
This can only mean that you are trapped deep within Zaehylos' dungeon, the vile prison 
of the ancient stories.
Many heroes have been held inside its walls, but none have escaped.</p>

<p>You try to stand, but your head is still spinning with pain and you fall upon 
a pile of bones.
A strange snort echoes outside the door to your cell.
Ignoring the pain, you stand again and grab a broken bone from the floor.
Within seconds there is a snarl right outside the door and you hide in a darkened 
corner of your cell.
The door slides open and a foot soldier enters the room.
You lunge at it, knocking it to the ground.
A surprised scream pierces your ears as you shove the shattered end of the bone into 
its body.</p>

<p>Convinced that it is dead, you grab its mace and prepare for what lies ahead.

If you can't escape, at least you'll leave the mark of your presence in the hearts 
of your enemies...</p>
