^C00'Master Wayne, it would be wise to preserve your coins in this part of Gotham. I checked the security cameras, and there are many hobos wondering around who are attacking everyone in sight and steal their money. Keep the amount of coins above 30, at the least. You'll be needing 20 coins to buy a key from a con artist, and you can buy hints from some of the more shady figures in this part of town, in case you get lost. If you do not have enough coins to buy the key, you will be stuck in this part of town with no way out. Be careful.'
