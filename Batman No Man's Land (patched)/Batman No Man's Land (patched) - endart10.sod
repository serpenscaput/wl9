^C7d The Beginning

^C00 It was going to be a long night.

Bane has been defeated, but it was too late to stop his attack. Using a device, he was able to stimulate an earthquake within the western part of Gotham. Many villains have taken advantage of the chaos in order to set up camp in the ruined part of town. It's Batman's task to find them all, starting with: The Riddler.
