^C7d Remote Batarangs

^C00 These experimental batarangs can be controlled remotely. All you have to do is keep pressing the 'fire'-button (l-ctrl by default), after which you can steer your batarang towards your intended target. Or you can use it to explore an area without being seen, though enemies will usually hear it when a batarang flies into a wall!
