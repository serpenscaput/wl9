^C02 Riddler Clue

^C04 For nostalgia's sake, one final riddle: just follow a certain element, it will be a batarang well spent! Aim it at a switch, and you might just survive without a hitch.

But I prefer if you don't, naturally, for defeating you would look marvelous on my supervillain-resume! And let's face it, this is just one big trap from which you cannot escape.
