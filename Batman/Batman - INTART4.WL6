^C7d THE STORY

^C00 While in the bank, it seems as though the Scarecrow wasn't just stealing money... 
he was BURNING it -- the money which went to fund the Gotham University. 

After you catch a brief glimpse of the Scarecrow, he gets into a helicopter and flies 
away. The helicopter starts to head for the Gotham University Museum. Is the Scarecrow 
trying to destroy the University out of revenge?
