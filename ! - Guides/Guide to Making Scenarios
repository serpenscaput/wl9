HOW TO CREATE WOLFENSTEIN LEVELS AND DISTRIBUTE THEM!This document teaches Wolfenstein fans like you guys how to make scenerios, get them out to the public, and make them popular!Stage 1: The Creating1. Make 1st AND 2nd and up scenerios. They'll be more popular that way.2. Download the WolfEdit Package from WolfAddict's Page. But whatever you do, do NOT use the Wolfenstein Mover application.3. Check out other scenerios that are popular. They serve as role models.4. Make your levels by creating 1 or 2 at a time, then testing them. You keep doing this until you have a complete scenerio.5. E-mail creators of popular scenerios like me, WolfAddict, Greg Ewing, Blake Zuckerman, Laz Rojas, Doug Ingram, Bob Thijs, and Christian Vinaa for advice on making scenerios. They offer useful advice. A list of people's addresses are at the end of this document.6. Every now and then, send a beta version of your scenerio to other Wolfenstein fans. They'll find bugs if there are any and let you know of them.7. Make your scenerios realistic. Don't put 100 Nazis in a room unless your scenerio is supposed to be a torture session.8. PUT IN OBJECTS! It'll make your scenerio feel like a castle.9. Download WolfEdit hacks. That'll give you special effects, like day/night scenes.10. The more music variation, the better.11. Get a BinHex converter for downloading scenerios. I've got one. E-mail me to get it.12. DO NOT MAKE UPDATES TO YOUR SCENERIOS THAT REQUIRE RESEDIT!!!Stage 2: The Preparing1. If your scenerios are for 3rd or the Commercial Encounters, make an icon for it so it'll appear in the little window in the "Choose your scenario" dialog box.2. Make an in-depth readme. Wolfenstein rookies wouldn't have a clue on what you're talking about if you don't give in-depth instructions on installation.3. Include your e-mail address in the readme. You'll get more customers that way.4. Try to include things to aid the user in installation, like the Wolf FKEY with its original instructions.5. Include demos of your other scenerios. It'll make them more popular.6. Use StuffIt to compress your files, not Compact Pro, DiskDoubler, or MacBinary. Make the files SEA files.7. DO NOT BINHEX YOUR FILES!!! Your e-mail program or the people you send it too will automatically BinHex them.8. DO NOT MACBINARIZE YOUR FILES!!! Not many people have MacBinary.9. DEFINITELY DO NOT MAKE YOUR FILES ZIP!!! I don't know any Mac users who like PCs anyway. Bill Gates seeks to destroy Apple. Trust me.Stage 3: Sending it Off1. Try sending them to Mac Gifts first. Include a brief summary (abstract) of the scenerio and what it includes besides the scenerio itself. They'll put it on all of the Info-Mac servers, and they're the most popular in the world. The Mac Gifts e-mailbox is macgifts@mac.archive.umich.edu.2. After that, send it to Doug Ingram. His e-mail address is ingram@u.washington.edu.3. If you made a 1st Encounter scenario, send it to the 2 addresses above and Christian Vinaa's e-mail address, which is para-vin@inet.uni-c.dk.4. Finally, send it to horace@erinet.com or radams@winternet.com for it to be reviewed. If it's good, it'll become even MORE popular!Stage 4: After All That1. When you get e-mails from customers, thank them for any good comments they made and be friendly to them. If they ask a question about a level of your scenerio, go back and look at it in WolfEdit format, and answer it in-depth. Tell them about upcoming scenerios.2. VERY occasionally, someone might REALLY like your scenerio if it's REALLY good and in fear of losing business, ask if you'd want to be his/her/its partner. I've never been in a situation like that, so I don't know about it. But, I DO know it happens.3. If someone asks you for something that ain't commercial, hand it over, or else they'll bad-mouth you. Don't hand it over if they ain't friendly about it.4. Work on another scenerio. It'll be better than the first one you made.5. If you really want to be known, why not start making Bolo maps? E-mail me about Bolo!6. DO NOT MAKE UPDATES TO YOUR SCENERIOS THAT REQUIRE RESEDIT!!! It does NOT work! Just send in the full, revised version to the people you sent it to.7. Ask other scenerio makers for new ideas for making scenerios.E-mail addresses of helpful people:Me (Josh Mills) horace@erinet.comJoel Adams: adamsjm@freenet.msp.mn.usLaz Rojas: filmman@pacificnet.netGreg Ewing: greg@cosc.canterbury.ac.nzDoug Ingram: ingram@u.washington.eduChristian Vinaa: para-vin@inet.uni-c.dkBlake Zuckerman: zuckerma@sfu.caWolfAddict Software: WlfAdSoft@aol.comChris Funk: funk@nas.comBob Thijs: Bob.Thijs@innet.beJeff Reinecke (Bolo guy.
