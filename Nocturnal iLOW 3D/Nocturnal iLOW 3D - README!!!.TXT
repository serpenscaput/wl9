Nocturnal - iLOW3D											16 January 2015


Here's a new mod and the fifth add-on by Ipank7000, 30 new levels. This is the SDL 
version so dosbox or any dos emulator isn't neccessary to play this mod. 

Because i some people asking me for the sequel of my previous mod called "The Trilogy 
- iLOW3D" so yeah, i make this mod. And now i studying in computer science so i think 
making this mod works perfectly for learning about code programming.

Thanks to:

 * The God, who has given favors, so i can finish this mod nicely		
 * id Software for releasing the Wolf3d source code
 * Ripper for creating the Wolf4SDL engine to play Wolf3d in Windows
 * Florian Stohr which create Floedit
 * All members of DHW and Haven forum and all Wolfers who make this game still alive

	- PM me in DHW forum (Ipank7000) or in Wolf3d Haven forum (Ipank7000)
