Wolfmods III
by Acord Games
Fumbling through hundreds of different Wolfenstein mods, I discovered a bunch
of features that I could include in my Pacstein game, which I first developed
about 20 years ago. Grabbing a feature here and a feature there, I gradually
think that the quality of the game has been increased, and the hardcore fans
will appreciate the new features.

You are Captain Zoom, trapped in the land of Pacstein, and surrounded by strange

eerie creatures. Filled by a strong yearning to escape back to the world of
your loved ones and friends, driven by that one desire to the point of
obsession. You must escape, yet you are surrounded by enemies who are totally
against your victory.

It's kill or be killed as you fight your way to escape! It won't be easy as you
venture through level after level of complex situations. Good luck in your
adventure! Create your own story as you go along!
