Strange Worlds
by Gary Acord

Fumbling through hundreds of different Wolfenstein mods, I discovered a bunch
of features that I could include in a wolfmod, the first of which I developed
about 20 years ago. Grabbing a feature here and a feature there, I gradually
improved the quality of my games, and then I released Wolfmods, Strange Worlds,
Kozmik Zones, Pacspear, Wolfhell, Super Wolfhell, and now Strange Worlds.

In Strange Worlds, you are Captain Zoom, trapped in another world, surrounded
by active eerie creatures. Filled by a strong yearning to escape back to the
world of your loved ones and friends, driven by that one desire to the point
of obsession, you must escape, yet you are surrounded by enemies who are
totally against your victory.

It's kill or be killed as you fight your way to escape! It won't be easy as you
pick you zone and venture through level after level of complex situations. Good
luck in your adventure!

Note: Some columns will disappear if you press your spacebar.
