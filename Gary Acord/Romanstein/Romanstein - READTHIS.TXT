Romanstein
by Zap Studios

Fumbling through hundreds of different Wolfenstein mods, I discovered a bunch
of features that inspired me to create this game. The beautiful graphics and
great maps used by Mr. Choi in his game Hotel Romanstein were highlights in
my venture, but I wanted them to be combined with some features I had found in
other Wolfmods, such as full-screeen, instant loading, and other features. So,
I decided that it would be interesting to create a game using Mr. Choi's
graphics, combined with my own and favorites I had discovered in other Wolfmods,

then presenting it with 16 of the best maps I could create or find.

Originally, I created the game for my own amusement and enjoyment, but the
outcome resulted in a game that I decided might be of interest to other Wolfmod
fans, so I decided to release it as freeware. Diehard fans will appreciate the
new features.

You are Captain Zoom, lost in Romanstein, and surrounded by beautiful,
merciless formidable Amazon warriors. Filled by a strong yearning to escape
back to the world of your loved ones and friends, driven by that one desire to
the point of obsession, you must escape, yet you are surrounded by enemies who
are totally against your victory.

It's kill or be killed as you fight your way to escape! It won't be easy as you
venture through level after level of complex situations. Good luck in your
adventure! You will create your own story as you go along!

Credits;

Many of the graphics came from Mr. Choi, from some I had created over the
years, and others from other Wolfmod games. I learned the programming from
studying the Wolfmod games of Michael Collin and others.
Other Wolfmod games can can be found on the
Wolfenstein mod site http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~brlowe/index.html.

Mr. Choi's Hotel Romanstein games were an inspiration.

Of course I must give thanks to ID Software for the classic Wolfenstein 3d and
Spear of Destiny, without which there could be no mod games.

I wanted to convert the sound to the sounds used in Hotel Romanstein, but have not 
figured out how to do this. If any ambitious person out there knows how to put some 
of Mr. Choi's sound effects from Hotel Romanstein into this game, email me a copy 
and I will update the game.

You may also experience the sound cutting out. If this happens just press T-A-B to
