^C10Fumbling through hundreds of different Wolfenstein mods, I discovered a bunch 
of features that I loved, great graphics and maps, full-screen capacity, and perusing 
them awhile inspired me to come up with a game that would incorporate the best of 
what I had seen into one program, and this resulted in Kozmik Zones.
