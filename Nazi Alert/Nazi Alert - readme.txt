NAZI ALERT! by Maxim Zhukov

This is My third Wolfenstein 3D add on. It has some changed graphics and 60 levels. 
I made it with WolfEdit 2.1 and Wolf3D Creator. All maps have been re-edited since 
version 1.0.


This is version 1.2 of Nazi alert! The final version will be 1.3 or 1.4. This version 
has no new sounds and maybe has some bugs. If You find a bug You should E-Mail Me 
about it to rim (at) omega.mplik.ru with subject "To Ratburger : INSTANTBUGGIN".

                                                                   Everybody could 
use levels/graphics of this add on for making his own add on.
