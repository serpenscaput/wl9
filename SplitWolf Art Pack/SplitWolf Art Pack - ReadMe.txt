This is an art patch 1.0 for "SplitWolf" (beta 2)
http://www.moddb.com/mods/splitwolf

Just replace the original lwmp folder with this one (deleting or overwriting the 
original folder)

What's new?
=============
Better player and SS sprites (by DoomJedi)
Fett and Otto 8-directional Boss frames (by UnTrustable)

Special thanks for Untrustable for the Boss frames.
