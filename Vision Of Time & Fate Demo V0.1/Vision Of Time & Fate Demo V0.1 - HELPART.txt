^C[LightGreen] ABOUT PAGE
^C[Black] Hello, welcome to my first public released mod.It took me a little over a year to make.I had to restart twice because I didn't like the way I made it.This game is heavily inspired from a mod called Shadow Genesis. I wanted to thank Mario Maniac and Mega Luigi for making that mod. This mod is currently work in progress which mean there are probably some bugs. Some of them are intentional.
