Escape From SS Prison TC for Wolf 3D
by Ronny Zeitz (graphics and sounds) and Brian Lowe (levels).

Thanks for downloading this set.  This has ten new levels (the first episode), and a lot of new graphics and sounds. The remaining five episodes have the levels from my first WolfBel set.

The set is fairly difficult, but not impossible to beat. There are a few keys in hidden rooms, and a few tricks here and there but the style  is otherwise fairly similar to that used in the original Wolfenstein 3D set. There are many new walls and objects, and I hope you will find the new sounds particularly effective. Many thanks to Ronny for providing these. 

This set is available from my main web site at http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~brlowe. It is listed as 'Stand Alone' levels in the registered levels section. There are also more than one hundred other sets available, including many for 'Spear Of Destiny'.

Ronny can be contacted by email on ronny@ryho.org - and my email address is brian@brlowe.globalnet.co.uk - Brian.
