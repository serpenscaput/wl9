^C7d Remote Arrows

^C00 These sticky arrows have three functions:

-Remote detonation: shoot an arrow against a wall, detonate it when it's most convenient.

-Timed detonation: will explode after a couple of seconds
-Proximity detonation: can sense when an enemy is nearby, will explode when the enemy 
is close enough.
