^C04 Drone Arrow

^C00 'Oliver, we made you a new toy. In a location closeby, we placed a drone arrow. 
You can use this weapon to get to places you wouldn't be able to reach normally. 
It can crawl on floors, walls & ceilings. It can pick up items and flip switches' 


'Try not to alert anyone, because they will shoot the drone. It's small, but they 
can notice it when you get too close'
