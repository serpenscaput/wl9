ASTROSTEIN Mac Version Quick-Fix for ECWolf
Original Version by Laz Rojas
Fix by Sam Feichter (AstroCreep)
Version 1.0 	
6/27/2015

This is a quick fix for Astrostein (Mac Version) for ECWolf.
This quick fix includes some placeholder graphics, as well
as the shim to get the mac version working properly.  
It also includes the sounds, which originally had to be
pasted into a copy of the MacWolf binary, which will not work with
ECWolf without replacing wolf3d.bin.  This essentially just
makes the mod playable and fixes a few out of place gfx (not all).

DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL

Menu graphics adapted from WolfenDOOM Version of Astrostein, Wolf 3D, and the ECWolf Tech Demo by Executor.
Includes fonts from Tech Demo by Executor
Includes updated MacWolf title track (ogg format.  rest aren't included since original has custom music which I haven't figured out how to access yet)


This is only a temporary build, as this is designed for the crippled version currently
being run by the dev versions of ECWolf.  As such, this WILL NOT WORK with the official releases yet, only the dev versions
which support MacWolf.  Dev versions can be found at http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/ecwolf/

This also includes the original Astrostein mod needed to run this fix, already
MacBinary'd up.

TO RUN:
Extract ZIP file
Drag and drop "Astrostein.bin" and "astrostein_fix.pk3" onto the ecwolf executable

OR

run "ecwolf --file Astrostein.bin astrostein_fix.pk3"


KNOWN ISSUES

This may be a side effect of my old ass computer but I have noticed
a slight lag while playing Astrostein.  I haven't experienced it with any
other mod except the mac version of the Astrostein mods, so I 
assume that it is the large amount of custom assets in the original file.

The sounds for the missile launcher and flamer replacements don't work, but this seems to be because of ECWolf's incomplete status on MacWolf, since it doesn't work in Vanilla either.
I decided not to do decorate (yet) for this fix, so there is no way to fix it until I decide to
