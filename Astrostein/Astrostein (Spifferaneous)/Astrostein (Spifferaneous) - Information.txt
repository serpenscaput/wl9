Astrostein Trilogy

Chapter 1: Astrostein
	On a routine survey mission of a Nazi base on the planet Omicron 
Theta IV, William J. Blazcowicz III was taken prisoner by a patrol officer.
B. J. as he was known was thrown into the holding cells of the Nazi base. He
overpowered his cell guard and was on his way to the exit of the Nazi base.
Along the way he finds information about the rebirth of Operation:
Eisenfaust.
	At the exit of the Nazi base B. J. meets up with the Robotic Hans
Grösse. This robot has the brain of Hans and recognizes you as a descendent
of the man who nearly killed him a century earlier. After a long battle with
one of his grandfather's arch-enemies Hans dies . . . again.

Chapter 2: The Return of Dr. Schabbs
	Following up from Astrostein 1 B. J. takes a Nazi freighter to a
large Starbase somewhere in the Alpha Prime sector. This is rumored where Dr.
Schabbs has been resurrected and continued his plan for Operation:
Eisenfaust.
	Inside the large space station B. J. finds the horrific creations of
the mad doctor. On the final top level of the station B. J. comes face to
face with the doctor himself. He still is up to his old tricks of shooting
B. J.  with his syringes. Even though B. J.  successfully destroyed his new
hovering body Dr. Schabbs's head is ejected and salvaged by the Nazis.
Perhaps someday Schabbs will return . . .

Chapter 3: The Final Seig Heil
	After a few weeks of R. and R. B. J. gets a call from Allied HQ
telling him that the Nazis have begun an all out invasion. The only way to
stop it is to find and destroy the Nazi's  new dictator: General Wolfgang von
Braun. He is the grandson of Eva Braun, Hitler's wife and he's all mad
because B. J. 's grandfather killed his Pappy. It's not nice when rival
families fight.
	On board the huge battleship that houses him, B. J. finally meets up
with the general. His body is destroyed but a fail-safe mechanism kicks in
and the torso and head begin to float on some invisible energy field along
with a chaingun. Finally, after about an hour of duck and dodge shooting,
General Wolfgang von Braun dies and takes the 4th Reich with him.

The Astrostein Prequel Trilogy

Chapter 1: Return to Berlin
	B. J. Blazcowicz III was called into action one day and told to
eliminate an immediate threat to the Earth known as "Welder's Reich" which
rose up from the 20th century's Neo-Nazis. The battle takes place in Berlin,
birthplace of Hitler's Reich and which now accommodates Welder's Reich.
	B. J.'s first battle comes between the guardian of the Reichstag, the
Robotic Hans Grösse. This robot was built by some Nazi technicians who gave
it the mind of Hans Grösse which in turn provided unique fighting skills.
Equipped with lazer-guided rockets, this Robot Hans made short work of anyone
who came near him. Too bad he didn't count on meeting B. J. He was easily
dispatched. The next mission would take him to a strategic base that held the
maps to Welder's secret hideout.
	
Chapter 2: Escape from the Western Wall
	At the old "Western Wall" bunker in Germany, B. J. is captured for
sneaking around. This is the base that holds the maps to Welder's hideout.
The bunker is heavily guarded and can not be penetrated by normal weapons.
We all know that B. J. is no normal weapon.
   	After he slips past security B. J. is on his way to the top level of
the bunker where the guardian of the maps waits for him. On the top level a
minion of Welder waits in his lazer-chiangun, rocket-launching, hovering
tank. If it weren't evil it would've been an awesome sight to see. It's a
fierce battle that wounds B. J. but doesn't take him out of the game.
Utilizing a nearby lazer-chaingun that some good Samaritan left for him he
destroys the hovering units on the contraption.
 	Unfortunately the blast also destroyed the weapons pod that held all
of the rockets on the hovercraft and destroyed it before the man inside could
be interrogated. Anyway, the maps say the Welder's base is only a few miles 
away and that Welder is a Colonel! That means that there is someone more 
powerful that Welder behind the whole operation. Then why call it "Welder's 
Reich?" Maybe to through B. J. off track.

Chapter 3: Operation: Welder
	As B. J. makes his way across the German countryside he encounters 
some citizens that have been gunned down by an army of Nazi soldiers. They 
say that Welder is on the move and is heading towards England via the 
TransContinental Bridge. It's up to B. J. to stop the maniac from seizing 
control of England.
  	Unfortunately B. J. falls just short of getting to Welder before he 
gets to England. It would've been easier to sniper him while he was on the 
move but B. J. doesn't mind navigating through Welder's fortification at the 
new Parliament. 
 	Inside he encounters Colonel Welder. Surprisingly, it's easy to kill 
him. His armor isn't very resistant and he dies easily. But wait, something's
wrong. Of course . . . clones. Welder's picture comes up on every monitor in 
the building and starts laughing at B. J.  He challenges him to a duel at the
top of the building, winner take all.
 	As B. J. moves though Parliament he encounters more Welder clones as 
well as other denizens. He even comes upon another Hans Grösse robot but it's
been disconnected.  Finally on the top level of the House of Parliament B. 
J. confronts Colonel Welder. The battle rages on with both sides inflicting 
serious damage. Finally, B. J. ruptures a hose to the dome around Welder's 
head and it de-pressurizes. Welder's armor is damaged and his head shrinks 
to the size of a baseball. Welder is dead now but there is still the 
question of who it is that is behind all of it. You look at Welder's uniform 
and it has the word "Braun" on it. No, it can't be . . .


* 1.1 - New Enemies *

Guard- Grist of the Nazi mill in the future. Guards are
       weak for the most part and only carry small lazer
       pistols for defense. 

Shock Troopers- Bad boys of the Nazi brigade. They carry 
    high power lazer pulse weapons that act alot like 
    old Earth machine guns. They wear a special helmet 
    with super enhanced vision visors.

Officers- Special patrol officers roam the corridors of
     	  Wolfgang's ship. They carry more powerful 
  	  lazers than the Guards and offer up a greater
          challenge.

Commandos- The strongest of the Nazi force aside from
	   the bosses themselves. They are armed with
	   rapid firing lazer assault pistols. I would
	   run. They are SILENT attackers.

Robots- Patrolling corridors these futuristic "puppies"
        are guys that are easily taken down and a real
        nuisance if they get right in front of you.

The Robot Hans- In the shuttle bay of the Nazi base on
 		Omicron Theta waits a robot with the 
		mind of Hans Grösse. He still carries
		his prized 2 chainguns that have been 
		enhanced with "modern" bullets. (Lazers)

Dr. Schabbs- The doctor is back and ready to do battle
	     in his new hovering body. He's still armed
	     with an array of serums which he fires at
	     you through a special launcher in his new
             hovering body. (If you've beaten him, you
	     notice that his head is ejected. That is
	     because Schabbs is an awesome boss and 
	     can't die. His head will be put on a new
	     body.)

Wolfgang von Braun- The new dictator of the Nazis is 
		    truly a challenge for even the 
		    toughest opponent. Encased in a big
		    suit of deuterium armor, he's ready
		    to mow down opposition with a few
		    lazer enhanced chainguns. 

The Robot Hans 2- An older version of the Hans robot. He
 		  guards the exit of the Reichstag. He
		  still carries his enhanced chainguns

The "Hover" Guy- He has no official name but "Hover" Guy.
		 This guy patrols the exit of the "Western
		 Wall" bunker in Germany. He is armed with
		 some rockets which he'll use at his own
		 discresion.

Welder Clones- Clones of Colonel Welder that are found on
	       every level of the Prequel Trilogy. They
	       fire some sort of plasma energy at you.

Colonel Heliarc Welder- The Colonel himself. He guards the
		        exit to Parliament. Welder is armed
 		        with his rockets `o fury. He'll use
		        them when necessary. Don't waste 
	                time admiring my artwork, destroy 
		        him!

* 1.2 - New Weapons*

Lazer Pistol- A small but powerful gun that can be used
	      on a variety of opponents.

Lazer Pulse Weapon- A new piece of 20'th century 
		    technology that replaces faulty old
		    machine gun bullets with high charge
		    lazer pulse shells.

Lazer Enhanced Chaingun- The defining maxim in defense.
  			 E.D.F.'s new Lazer Chaingun can
			 rip through Nazis like there
			 was no tomorrow. Use sparingly
			 though, it has a healty 
			 appitite for ammo. (also known as
			 the Repeator.)

* 1.3 - Other New Items *

Booster Pack- 5% to 10% healing.

Large Booster Pack- 15% healing.

First Aid Kit- 25% healing.

Ammo Pack- 5 lazer charges.

Yellow Cross- 100/1000 points.

Red Cross- 500/5000 points.

Extra Life- Full healing, extra life, 25 lazer charges.

Yellow/Blue Keycard- Used to open corresponding doors.

* 1.4 - Why? *

For years now since I saw the MAC version on Laz Rojas' webpage, I had an
obsession with Astrostein. When I found the PC version at WolfAddict software
and saw that it was unfinished, I wanted to kill someone. I knew something
had to be done.

I took it upon myself to create a series of episodes worthy of the name 
"Astrostein." While my levels and story do not correspond to the original
came, I feel they capture the true essence of the greatest Wolfenstein addon
of all time: The Astrostein Trilogy.

* 1.5 - Wrapping it all up *

Thanks for playing ny Trilogy and we hope to see you
around our corner of the block again.  There's
a world of Wolfensteiners out there who want more, more,
more. Thanks for playing. Come back soon.
