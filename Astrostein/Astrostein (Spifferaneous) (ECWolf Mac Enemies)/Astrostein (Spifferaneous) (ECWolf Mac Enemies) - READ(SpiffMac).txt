ASTROSTEIN (Spifferaneous Version) - Conversion to ECWolf 1.3.2 (HD VERSION)
based off of Macintosh Wolf3D mod "Astrostein"
created by Gerald Heffner (Spifferaneous)
converted by Sam Feichter (AstroCreep

This update enhances the graphics of the original conversion of Spiff's Astrostein.
In the style of my "HD" Halten Sie! mod, this updates the walls and most static sprites to 
128x128 graphics, adds floor graphics and brightness levels, and replaces the actors with
cleaned up versions of themselves (in this case, Laz's WolfenDoom sprites).  I have also updated
sounds, and used the mac versions of the weapons.


(Original info)
This is a quick conversion of Spifferaneous' version of Astrostein for the PC
version of Wolfenstein 3D.  This version was originally made because there was
no Astrostein mod for the PC version, save Bruce Ryder's 3 level demo.  For
some reason (prob the WolfAddict drama back in the day), it was never completed.
So, Spiff took it upon himself to make his own version of Astrostein, with different
enemies and levels.  There are 6 new episodes.  More info can be checked out in the
"SpifRead.txt" and "SpifInfo.txt" files within the pk3.

I also took the liberty of including Bruce Ryder's 3-level demo as a bonus
episode.


CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL

Deleted doubles of graphics, using DECORATE to replicate Giftmacher and Officer
Added extra "disintegrate" sound effect during death
new HUD graphics and title screen and such!  This wasn't possible when this was originally released!
Extra music from Spear of Destiny and Blake Stone!
Bruce Ryder's shitty enemy sprites replaced with Laz's much nicer ones
Nicer walls!
Floors!
Light levels!
Weapons from the Mac version! (I've hidden the 2 extra weapons in random secret places)
Beef
