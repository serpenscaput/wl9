This is only a temporary build, as this is designed for the crippled version currently
being run by the dev versions of ECWolf.  As such, this WILL NOT WORK with the official releases yet, only the dev versions
which support MacWolf.  Dev versions can be found at http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/ecwolf/

This also includes a modified Astrostein 2 mod needed to run this fix, already
MacBinary'd up.

TO RUN:
Extract ZIP file
Drag and drop "graveyard_data.bin" and "graveyard_fix_PC.pk3" onto the ecwolf executable

OR

run "ecwolf --file graveyard_data.bin graveyard_fix_PC.pk3"
