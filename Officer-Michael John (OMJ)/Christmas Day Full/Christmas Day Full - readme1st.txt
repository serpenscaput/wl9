Author's notes:
This is a Cristmas-themed mod, inspired by Bob and Adrienne's Xmas Wolf and Reactor's 
(unreleased
at the time) Christmas Eve and NTGames's Christmas Special. It also includes some 
elements of Ringman's The Night after Christmas
mod. I've pretty much loved both mods (i hope some day Reactor will release Christmas 
Eve, because
it looks very promising!), so i've mixed it all together to make a little surprise 
to all my
guests on our webpage (forum)/Facebook page & group, and of course to my YouTube 
viewers!

Known bugs:

Secret level 12 ending go back to level 11
