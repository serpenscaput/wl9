(Last & Final mod)
                                                ==========================================================


It's my Last & Final mod of my wolf 3D modding. I wrote some important thing from 
mod. 

===============
Important things:

- It uses Wolf 3D version 1.1
- If you would like to use -goobers function then so start it:wolf3d -oldtime 
- I added hex edits. All thing I couldn't do it. Example:End level item because for 
technique problem
- Replaced Pacman Ghosts into Animated Objects therefore you can't get 100% kill 
ratios from 1st level till 8th level. Sorry for it
- Same thing of kills on final ratios as on level's ending
- It uses 1 million point function therefore Score's part of HUD isn't correct
- Edited Par Times,but these don't work (1st-8th level)
- You will get Floor Completed from 9th level till 20th level
- Don't use other episodes because I edited level that you can go yet for more level 
as 10
- I added new 2 key,but you won't look their pics on HUD
- On MLI cheat you always get 2 key (I don't recommend it!)
- You can read Read This! and End text 
- I couldn't replaces demos
- You can't warp till level 21 but also just till level 20 (Debug Mode)
