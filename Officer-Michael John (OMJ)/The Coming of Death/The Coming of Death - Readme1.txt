These you need know from Mod:

- Ammo box uses the Extra life function. I added with Hex Edit therefore I couldn't 
add as SOD Ammo box.
- -killers the Cheat code on starting and not -goobers.
- I used Wolf 3D Shareware 1.4 version (Apogee) and you don't wonder,that it have 
some bug. E.G:On Doors' wallpics doesn't work.
