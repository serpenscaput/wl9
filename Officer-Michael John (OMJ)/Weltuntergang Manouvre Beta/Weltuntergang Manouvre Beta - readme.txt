Hi!

*You've just downloaded Project:Weltuntergang`s manouvre (Wu-Gang), a Wolfenstein 
3D Total Conversion. For more info, check "Read me" in the main menu of the game.


*Wu-Gang should be rather bug-free, but if you find something, please mail me: kukimik (at) poczta.onet.pl 
or catekoprotokol (at) gmail.com

*Cheats: run the game with command: wolf3d.exe -kuki, and then use the cheats just 
like in the original Wolf3D

*There're 2 executables: wolf3d.exe & wolf3-d.exe The first one runs faster on older 
machines, but may have problems on the new ones. Wolf3-d.exe is a modified exe for 
the new copmuters. I can't say exactly which one will be better for you, you should 
check it.

*Thanks to Peter Johansson for providing the modified exe file and the "Wu-Gang" 
name & to Alex GS for info on a map bug.

*I hope you'll enjoy playing Wu-Gang

Kuki and Officer-Michael John
