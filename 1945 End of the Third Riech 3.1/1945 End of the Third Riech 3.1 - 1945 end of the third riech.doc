Thank you for downloading 1945 The End Of The Third Riech my first ever successful Wolfenstein 3D addon.In the past I had a couple to few attempts to make an addon but either I never had the time, patiance or lack of skills or it would end up screwed because I did something wrong and I lost my work but for the first time ever I have made the time and put alot of thought and effort into making it.\par
You may come across some bugs in the game but Ive played through and ammended as much as I could. The code editing is my weak spot, I tried my very best to encode all the changes this mod was intended to have but one fault is disabling the Boss's Death Cam I don't know how to make Death Cam bosses drop a key so I put a gold key by the exit, but just because you can coward your way from some bosses doesn't mean do. The Par times is another defect, I tried to change the Par times and End level intermissions to suit this mod but hit a few errors so ignor some of the End level intermissions. Other than that I think I have achieved my goal to create good levels from scratch, alot of thought went into these levels, years of practice soon paid off.\par

\par
\pard It's the year 1945, the war has been going on for nearly six years.The nazis fight to keep Hitler's twisted dream alive to take over the world. The allies sent out a polish guy named BJ Blazcowicks AKA The One Man Army.\par
You BJ Blazcowicks grandson of the man who brought the first world war down who has fought and accomplished many missions. You are the allies only hope if you can't bring the third riech to an end then no one can. You BJ Blazcowicks take out your pistol with 8 bullets and your trusty knife and get flown to a nearby open forset by some castle in a helecopter.It's time to go in there and bring an end to the third riech.\par

New guards and bosses from Spear Of Destiny and other addons and original Wolfenstein. \par
New weapons some original Wolfenstein weapons and some from other addons.\par
New items from other addons and original Wolfenstein.\par
New sounds from other addons and Spear Of Destiny and original Wolfenstein.\par
All new VGA screen graphics and a brand new status bar.\par
25 amo crate added.\par
Changed ceiling colours to fit in with the level location.\par

Boss action replays removed.\par
All new epic music from verious origins and games in midi format or some new imported music and some original Wolfenstein music.\par
\par
Version 3.0\par
I decided to have another go at polishing End of the Third Reich up to enhance the quality and experience \par
\par
New features in version 3.0\par
Many levels have been changed, Secret areas have been polished with verious ways to hint small secrets including wall decoration and other subtle hints, Super Secret areas and access to Secret levels can be well hidden though, one hint is to look where one wouldn't expect to find a Secret area. Plus other general mapping errors and skill have been polished up from what I have learned and built on over the years.\par
2 extra keys ( unfortunatly they don't show up on the status bar as I didn't quite understand the tutorial, but they are just like the extra keys in Hex Edited mods like Armageddon and Schabb's 2000 ), Super Secret rooms or areas require a bronze key and some of the later levels require you to find a red copper key in addition to the gold and silver keys.\par
An attempt to change the screen colours ( unfortunatly that didn't go quite to plan, theres still a cyan splodge where the Status bar is and the End level screen is still cyan).\par
Some of the music has been changed as some of the music previously didn't quite fit the mod, that problem has been ammended thanks to Adam Biser's IMF Creator ( a dead simple alternative to Darkone's IMF tools, thanks to Lingyan203 for telling me about Adan Biser's IMF Creator ) I can now have all the music to my exact liking which is the main reason I decided to release this new version of End Of The Third Reich. I also had a go at composing some of my own music ( hope you like my own music creations ).\par
Some new vswap graphics also included. \par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
A few bugs to be aware of\par
\par
As stated above I had an attempt to change the border and screen colour from cyan to grey, unfortunatly half of the screen is still cyan, at least I tried.\par
Also as stated above some of the End level intermissions are incorrect, there is an explanation as stated above. \par
The 2 new keys don't have icons on the status bar but they function in the same way in Hex edited mods like Barry Christian's Armageddon and Gary Ragland's Schabb's 2000. \par
I also experienced that certain levels in this version dump out at random times if played without Dosbox ( in particular level 3 ). I don't understand why this happens as I have done everything correctly, but it seems to run smoothly in Dosbox at an acceptable speed as it's EXE changes are mainly just core essentials.\par
