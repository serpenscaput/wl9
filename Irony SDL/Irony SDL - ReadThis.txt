    This started out as 8 unfinished SPEAR levels for "So you want to be an Assasin". 
I came across these while cleaning up a bunch of stuff off John's old computer about 
6 months ago. Time has finally allowed me to work them up into a playable game. Some 
of these were pretty raw and needed a lot of editing and I added a couple more and 
we have IRONY, a lost episode of carnage and puzzles.
 I work slower these days so I apologize if this has taken awhile to come about, 
but I think you'll enjoy my "Old School" approach to the game. You won't find any 
floor or cieling textures here, but a recompiled exe by Brian Rowan allows for seamless 
levels and no Episode menu so that you can get right into the action and commence 
a'blastin..I have changed the music around and imported some SPEAR music so the atmosphere 
of the original game is strictly adheared to...Don't expect an easy time of it though, 
because you are gonna have to use more than your gun to get out of these levels with 
your butt intact! Remember, the only rules here are that they will shoot you and 
they are relentless! SAVE often and pick up all the ammo you can! NONE of the keys 
are in hidden rooms, requiring pushwalls to be activated, but you will have to work 
for them. Remember, TRANSGROSSE and the UBERMUTANT are clones, so they could be ANYWHERE 
in the castle and possibly more than once? BwaHAHAHA!!
As always...Thanks to many friends for help and support, namely:

and...I can't forget MO!
Enjoy the set and Lock and Load!
Hey Mo!!!
There's another set coming too!
