Ah, yes... the infernal README.  Was going to do a HEARME video version of a README, but then I got sleepy and took a nap.

ack's old.

So after watching a recent playthrough of 6.25 (thank you AnchorKnight Gaming) it got me to thinking about mini-maps.  Then I thought about the Angel of Death Level.  Could I do one that's worthwhile on a grid of less than 20 x 20?  Challenge accepted!

So over a period of a week or two I put together a full SoD set of mini-maps.  Most of them are 17 x 17 with some a bit larger usually to make the aesthetics work.  It's a different kinda set I must admit.

So now the warning.  I mixed the difficulties so it isn't a steady progression.  A couple of the levels slap you silly right from the beginning.  As with some of my work it doesn't hurt to try a skill level lower to learn the levels first, but hey... go crazy.

Level 10, for me anyway, was a ball-buster on IADI.  Be warned and it doesn't hurt to think (that's a promise).  There are a couple of levels where I use diagonals to the max and you'll hate them and love me (or vice versa).  You'll soon know why some people call me a prick and others call me a mapping master (retired).  Don't expect convention.  With only so many squares to work with and 21 levels I needed to get creative.  Every level has secrets, treasure and enemies so perfect ratios are possible.  Having said that,  on level 14 it is possible to mess up the secrets.  You've been told.

Time for another nap.  Did I mention I'm old?

Stay well, stay safe & peace
