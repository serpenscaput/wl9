Prologue (the remaining levels from the original Wolf-Extra not found in Wolf-Extra 
SV).
This edition has a total of 21 levels including 4 secret levels.
The "Death Incarnate" difficulty level is designed to be as difficult as possible 
without being impossible!
It is possible to get the 100% ratio in all three categories on all levels, including 
the boss- and secret levels.
All levels have been tested and won on "Death Incarnate" with total ratios of 100% 
in all three categories.

Remember to leave saved games in different slots so that you may go back to different 
stages of the level you are on if you need to.
