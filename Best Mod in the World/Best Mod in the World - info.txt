"Get psyched". 
Shooting troubles:
Using OpenGL mode, you won't be able to finish some episodes and you won't see the 
NEW "get psyched" screen. 
Using DOS mode, sound will not work with NT (get VDMsound or DOSbox) and probably 
you won't see the NEW "end level activated" wall. 
Using 4D mode, you might have blurred delusions and probably smash your cousin's 
face with a sausage. 
If something doesn't work - go eat some blubber. 
If you get offended by something - kill yourself. 
Retard.
