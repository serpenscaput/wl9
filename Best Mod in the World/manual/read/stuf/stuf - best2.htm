<h2>WEPONS</h2>


<h3>EXPERMENTAL BGH2003XAG-134B</h3>
<img src=gun1.gif>
This wepon louks familar but its not. Its not a german hitleren Lugar but other wepon. 
When Amercan forses invented it, they saugh that it can blow throw walls and other 
staff ,so be allways sure that it can hook you with new assistence of damaging firepowar 
against enemys. it also youses amunition, not very freqently, tough. Good for killing 
somone.

<h3>CROS OF SPEAR</h3>
<img src=gun2.gif>
This artefact was taken from Satan daemon spawn from hell and it has very much supernatuaral 
powerfullnes. Therefor in such good hands like of those in BJ, it uses its good powers 
to naturaly kill bad people, nazys end variuos things who are not okay with sometheng. 
Very not bad wepon. Allmost the best, but not quiet yet so.

<h3>PISTOL</h3>
<img src=gun3.gif>
This the best wepon in the woarld. Youse it wiselie. Ammo eats fast. Beside it overheats 
which you can see at a smoke coming out after you shoot sometheng that moves or not 
quiet.

<h3>FLAMETROWER</h3>
<img src=gun4.gif width=256 height=256 alt="FLAMRETROWER PIC">
Flametrower can fire on enemys and you can be happy with it for as long as ammo you 
have doesnt finish itselve. Its funney looking when enemys die out of fire but you 
have to get that in game you like saving amunition for it. Wepon flametrower.


<h2>POWER-UPPS</h2>
You can go power up in some place if you are loucky enouf finding it.

<h3>AMUNITION</h3>
<img src=box2.gif>
This is very impourtant cause your gona need it later for shooting, if you dont wish 
to dye to soon. Be intelegent and colect it as much as you can. Amunition is also 
very yousefull.

<h3>SMAL FOOD</h3>
<img src=box3.gif>
Food in dongeons is not very good served for dogs and others, so you meigh find it 
disgusding by looking at it. but you become healt points if you eat so there's not 
that much diferenc afterall what you pick up for geting healt points at al.

<h3>MEET</h3>
<img src=box4.gif>
You get more points then as for the previos one.

<h3>CORPS</h3>
<img src=box5.gif>
If you want you can take dead enemys for scoring so that you can put you're name 
in high scores table of fame and maebe ecksxanging in bettwen you're friends or families. 
Varios corps add diferent points so pickup the ones you think are valueble enoug 
for making great gameplay.



<h2>ENEMYS</h2>

<h3>CREAZY NAZYS.</h3>
<img src=enemys1.gif>

Wathc out!! Theye can be dangeruos as much as it gets of. Elimineight them from hard 
distanse. And watch out. Theye can also tric you bye hiding in cover as table and 
such.

<h3>FURNACES</h3>
<img src=enemys2.gif>
Can becom invisibil so you coudn't be able to see them. Theye can drop amunition 
if hit by deth. You can drop some buletts for them to, so dont dye if you see that 
they are on you back. VERY VERY DANGERUOSS!!!! Servival is not very comun if you 
dont shoot straight back at its direction after you feal that sometheng has ben going 
on off your back when you run somewere.

<h3>OTHER</h3>
<img src=enemys3.gif>
There are much more enemys, but we well not go on detailed cause we have alot other 
projeckts that we plan to relees for comunity to play and time is not enoug. Now 
som boses.

<h3>GRETEL</h3>
<img src=enemys4.gif>
No wounder she has gone through your last strike when you were looking for secret 
plans somewhere in dongeons and now she wil want you fight bad. Nowing that BJ is 
nearly very fat and by fihgting whole time in dongeons he eats only cold unbalenced 
food, she will try to contraduckt your concious by showeng almost bare. Dont make 
a fool off yourselve cause you then will dye.

<h3>UBERHITLER</h3>
<img src=enemys5.gif>
VERY VERY VERY VERY DENGEROUS!!!!!! He has so much chainguns that you will dye so 
fast that you coudnt even scream for help from anywhere in the hole dungeons because 
you will already be dead when you start screaming it. You will shoot and shoot and 
again shoot but it wil be difucult, beleave me... Uberhitler is also very powerfull, 
so that its firepower hits the surface with very high killing rate and if you are 
there you will dye. Hide over sometheng and atack by making him a surprize. He will 
be surprized but still continyou to shoot at you, so be carefull with it.
<p>
Aslo, beware of fagots. Well there is not much of fagots here at al, but just to 
being safer always be vigilant, they go cover themselves and look for you to kill 
you
