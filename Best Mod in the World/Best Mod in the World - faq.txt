Q: GL?
A: We are very sorry for the fact that our team of developers used to
   spend so much paytickets to open-air metalfests and bying food that
   was later thrown away on the street, that we might consider even
   paying you back the money you spent on the bytes you downloaded
   for the GL version of THE BEST MOD IN THE WORLD. Wisely said, but
   you should be more of a completely messed up 
   if you can't figure out how to run a dos program without losing
   either sound or music (or both!!!!). Get yourself a pager.

   unknown information, that provokes interest. Simple as that.

R: Excuse me, lady, are you okay?
Q: NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE, ASSFACE!

R: What's this all about bears anyway? Haven't you had enough of
   yer mustard lubricated sausage mustache memory crash geek barfs
   or are you some kind of an ol' rotten dirty slimy stinky
   jiggerish meatball looking for an acquaintance on new years
   eve?
G: Gee, I never thought I'd meet someone ugly like you!

J: COFFE?!
