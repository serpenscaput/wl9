Max approches the dead body, and reads the name label. "Dian von Ainshaaft. "Weird" 
- Max thinks - "this one kinda reminds me of a boss from an old Dos 3d game, but 
nude... but Max can't remember her name...Greshel? Tegrel?..well, never mind. 
Max looks around. Trucks and boxes capture his attention. Large trucks, armored and 
look alot like tanks. Why are there so many trucks, and what is in all those boxes? 
Max feels those boxes hide many of the secrets he is looking for. Max tries to open 
one, then another, only to find they are already empty. The label on them say's "Eva 
S. Labs". Max looks around, and sees an entrance for some kind of a storage space. 
Let's see what secrets may it hide.....
