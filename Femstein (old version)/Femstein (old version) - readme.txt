Story:
[quote]
The year is 1998. After a wave of beatiful women and 
known models dissapearing all around the world, the 
Russian intelligence have finally got a partial success on 
putting some light on the mystery. Some emails and 
phone calls were intercepted, and the information was 
most disturbing. 
Apparently, on Island of Lesstop in the Pacific Ocean, a 
secret "amazonic" women movement established their 
main base. The goal of the movement is to create a female 
army to take over the "Male-dominated" world and 
create a female domination all over the Earth. Man will 
be used as slaves. To acheive that goal, women from 
around the world are being kidnapped and transferred 
to this Island.......[/quote] the rest of the story details you can read
at the README section and intermission screens, so making
long story short: [quote]..........Some male agents were sent there, but got too 
distracted by half-nudity of the guards that couldn't fight 
and got shot pretty fast. 

Your mission is - to enter the Island and find any useful 
information on the rebellion. and DON'T GET 
DISTRACTED by the femme fatals!.......[/quote] 

NOTES: 
1.  I+L+M cheat was changed to F+A+X cheat.

* The mod wasn't in any way meant to be offensive to women
