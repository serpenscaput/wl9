                  ***   ALIENwolf Graphic Set v1.0  ***
                  -------------------------------------

This file contains a complete revamp of the original Wolf3D graphic
set fashioned after the Alien series.  Nearly all of the walls and
objects have been changed to look like the bowels of a drifting
space station, the treasures are now the ships crew to rescue, and
all of the enemy have been repainted to look (somewhat) like the
nasty clawed alien creature things from the movies.

Along with the new graphic set are 8 sample levels to show off the
new graphics a bit.  Bear in mind that I am not the best map maker,
and I didn't really playtest each level as much as I should've, but
the maps are somewhat fun and definetly cover all of the graphics.
I also included my .DEF files to help in creating your own maps.

Here's what you need to do.  Go out and find the 1WOLF14.ZIP
file and install ver1.4 of Wolf3D in a directory somewhere.  Then
simply unzip ALIENW01.ZIP over top of the vanilla Wolf3D game, and
you're set to pop some bugs.  Tracking down MAPED6.ZIP will let
you create your own maps with the Alien graphic set.

==================================================================

Here's the scenario:  After loosing all communication with the 
station, The Corp has sent you as a one-gun army aboard the station 
to discover the whereabouts of the crew, and rescue as many as 
possible.  Simply "tagging" a crew member will provide the transfer
coordinates for immediate extraction.  Remember to tag everyone, even
those who are unconscious/dead.  Those distant family members will be
quick to pursue legal action if you should leave someone simply 
because they "looked" dead.

You will meet up against three type of aliens: Runners (Fast and Clawed),
Preditors (Cloaked and Armed), and Officers (Uncloaked and Really Armed).
You will start at the air lock of your ship and make your way across
the gerbil tube to the stations air lock.  Once you have secured each
level of the station, make your way to the base of the station 
(Sublevel 8).  There you will find three escape pods to return you to 
your ship, and almost certain promotion.  If you feel The Corp may not
adequately compensate you for your mental and physical punishments, be
sure to pocket as much Gold Credits as possible along the way.  (Gotta
have some kind of Real treasure in there.)

======================================================================

This graphic and map set are essentially freeware, so please distribute
it as freely as you like.  All that I ask is that you keep the entire
archive intact.  Do not add anything or alter the graphic set in any way
for redistribution.  Though it may not look like it, a great deal of the
new graphics were handpainted, which took a rather long time, so please
respect the archive.  If you come up with some neat new pictures, by all
means use them in your maps, but don't repost the set with your pictures.
I do intend to update the graphic set (Change the guns, improve the 
aliens, etc...) so if you'd like to see your pictures in the complete
set let me know and I may put them in and give you credit.  If you post
your own maps, do not include the graphic set.  Just point to where it
can be found.  Thanks.

Also, I haven't really tried using the Wol3D sound editors yet, so 
if someone feels creative, knock yourself out.  And let me know, I'd
like to hear what you've done.

Incedently, if you are the overtly generous type who feels obligated
to encourage stuff like this, here is what you can do:

1) If you like the artwork and would like to possibly see more in the
   future (Maybe changing all the creatures in DOOM to Nazis.) feel
   free to send donations, loose change, or just a postcard to the 
   address below.  You'll make a guy in the mid-west all happy-like.

2)  If you like the fact that the new artwork and maps were possible,
    thank your local creators of Wolf3D hack-tools (Thanks guys!),
    and possibly encourage them to repeat the good effort for future
    games.

3)  Finally, if you liked anything else about this, register a game with
    Id or Apogee.  After all, they Literally did all the hard stuff.
   

=======================================================================
The usuals:  This graphic and map set are used at your own risk.  
I don't see how they could harm anything, but to use them is to 
absolve myself or Id or Apogee or anyone else of responsability 
with the exception of possibly yourself.  Enjoy.
