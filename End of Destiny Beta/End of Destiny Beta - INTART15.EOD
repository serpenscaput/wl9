^C24 CHALLENGE LEVEL 3!!!

^C00 There's a coward's emergency exit stairway just up ahead to the right if you're 
not feeling overly heroic. But should you pluck up some courage and behave like the 
hero you're supposed to be, there's a special reward waiting for you at the end of 
this level.

Remember, carefully planned strategy and good timing are the keys to your success. 
Learn from your mistakes! And maybe, just maybe, you won't end up as a red stain 
on the floor...
