Get Goldfire
By Joe M

Note:
Thank you for downloading the sequel to my other spear add-on Blake and the
Spear.This game contains some graphics and sounds from Planet Strike.I
extracted them using Extendable Wad Editor.I also selected the Blake
Stone palette.

Story:
The spear is back in its place and what about Dr Goldfire?.Bad news he has
been creating tanks equipped with a rocket launcher and a chaingun.These
tanks are very dangerous and some of them have been seen around Dr Goldfire's
labs and bases.Dr Goldfire must be destroyed once and for all.Then the world
will be safe.
