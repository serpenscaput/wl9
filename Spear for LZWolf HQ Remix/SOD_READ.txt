HQ REMIX for LZWolf
AstroCreep 2020

This is a HQ remix of SOD for LZWolf, utilizing features such
as light levels, scaling, halo lights and a few other tricks along with
the 128x rotational sprites from ZDoom Forums to give a slightly updated
experience.  

Unlike the Wolf3D HD mod, maps 17, 18 and 21 had to be edited manually for visual effect, so those 3 edited maps are
included in the MAPS folder.
