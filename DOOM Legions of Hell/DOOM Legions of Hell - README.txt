Thanks for downloading DOOM: Legions of Hell. This is a warning to all people who 
have slow and small memory computers. This version of DOOMLOH is very limited in 
memory and may crash while playing. I have tested it on an old 386 computer and it 
worked, except for a few areas where it was out of memory. And in-game has super-slow 
frame rate. It took 10 minutes to load the shade tables. I hope you aren't running 
a computer like that, otherwise you might as well forget playing this game... Anyways, 
enjoy the game, and if you do run across any errors, email me at drewmccauley@charter.net 
just state the error, and leave a brief description of what you were doing and where 
you were in the game. It helps me reference what the error might be.

"PM_GetPage: Invalid request" happens often, but that cannot be helped.

"MM_GetPtr: Out of Memory" is going to happen a lot on low-end computers.

The memory problems will be fixed in the DOS\4GW version of the game. Which will 
come out next. I don't know when.
