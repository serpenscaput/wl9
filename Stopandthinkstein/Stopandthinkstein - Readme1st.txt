		Wolf 3d was very easy to edit, so I edited it. Basically it, think creatively .


	The boss to this game, just for fun is the fridge from the film Indiana Jones 4. 
"Nuke the Fridge" a running joke. I was having trouble editing some graphics on my 
computer so the ending is the same as another game, and most graphics are the same 
. I take no credit for same graphics.  

	There is one level , one glitch that I know about. In the level where the whole 
map is mirrored , with zombie walls , there is a door in the level that causes it 
to glitch slightly get past that part of level as quick as you can. It wont crash 
if you just continue on past it. The game will recover quickly and perfectly but 
if you danced around that part of the map it MIGHT crash. I never wanted to find 
out. Don't worry, its minor but it is there, I thought I should mention it. It's 
towards the end of map, when you see it you will see that it is not that bad.

	Over all game hints (to make the game easier or if you are stuck)

^^^ Things to know, some times when you do not have 

- When some doors are locked and there is no key you must have a guard open the door


 `	Be careful who you kill, and when you kill them
	

	Certain blocks can be pushed again, again, and again, again etc 

	STOP AND THINK

	Blocks can be used to build things, or as cover. 

	Certain levels have patterns in their designs, puzzles.

	NEVER WASTE AMMO

	If you are fighting an impossible opponent(s) then you are not doing the 	right 
thing . You will occasionally fight a boss, but never more than one 	at once unless 
you fcked up. 

	It is all possible but sometimes you need to think creatively. 

	Dead Guards can block doorways keeping them open. 

	Level 8 is a little fubar if you find its glitch run past it.
