DieHard Wolfers Forums: Map Making Mania Melée

README.TXT

A contest consisting of entrants each submitting a maximum of three levels to be played with the original 60-level full version of Wolfenstein 3-D (including original VSWAP). Original concept by Zach Higgins.

Just the map files, a new exe and the demo's are included in this version, along with a text only version of the complete thread concerning the contest from the Die Hard Wolfers Forum. Other files need to be supplied from the full 60 level version of Wolfenstein 3D. Most 1.4 versions should be compatible. An all files version of this contest is also available.

Just a few statistics:

Participants who submitted 3 levels: 6
Participants who submitted 1 level: 1
Total number of levels to be judged: 19

FLOOR 04: Boss Level: Harry Sr 
Not submitted for judging. It was originally made for 'Beyond Mutantstein SE', the John Bucksnort Tribute Set, though it didn't get a place there, as every map slot was already occupied. Slightly amended to fit the original Wolfenstein 3-D's VSWAP.


Final comments:

Most of the levels were of good quality. I gave 7 of them a score of 90 points each and some others 80 or 85. This reflects how difficult it was for me to choose among them. 

Some levels had good guard use but many just had still and deaf guards. 

Some levels were quite symmetrical. I don't like symmetrical levels very much but that is just a preference of mine and I didn't mark any levels down because of it. Re the use of 'tricks' in some levels, like holowalls, I was neutral to these and didn't mark them up or down.

All results and comments were made before knowing who made each level.

Some of the ceiling colours have been changed, particularly on episode 4 where the original colours did not fit well with the levels. Also, the episodes' names have been substituted by the authors' names, and the music order and some par times have been changed. In this latest version, the demo's have been changed too.
