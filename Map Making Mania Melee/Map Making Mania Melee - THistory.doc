How's that for a cheesy title? Huh? How's that?? Ahem... Well I'm think I'm going to do this. Dugtrio17, Schabbs (Brian Lowe) and I are going to be the judges. 

Here are the rules: 

1) Maps ONLY! No graphic, sounds, or coding changes. 
2) 3 Maps. Enough for a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
3) 1 Month. Enough time for 3 maps. If enough people want more time than I will increase the time. 
4) Anything goes. Make them fun. I'm bored.  
5) Minimum of two contestants. I can't have a contest unless two people compete.  
6) You can use either Wolf3D Shareware or Full Version. No spear maps. 

And... for some reassurance... If anybody wants to be a judge just let me know. 

Any questions?

Hey! Great idea, never thought of that... would be a fun compilation huh? People would be striving to make the best and if a LOT of people compete than we could pick the cream of the cream of the crop.  

So... are you in like you're going to compete or do you want to be a judge?

Yes, a good idea Zach (and Dugtrio 17). Is the full 60 level version of Wolf 3D going to be used, or the shareware ? 

I'd be happy to be one of the judges if it's ok.

@thejosh: Got it.  

@Schabbs: Good question. The full version will be used. It has many more textures and sprites so it'll create more variety. Actually... the full version won't be used exclusively. Meaning, you can use the Shareware version if that's all you have to work with. It'll be even more amazing if you (whoever) can dazzle us with a good shareware map. 

And of course it's ok for you to be a judge.

Awesome. 3 maps in a month should give enough time to people while decreasing the possibility of a "fluke" level, or whatever you want to call it. 

You will probably need to set a date for a concrete deadline, though. Oct 14th, I assume, will be the day everything is due...right? Also, is there any specification for which levels they need to be? Just the first 3 of any episode, right?

Sorry for taking so long to reply guys our internet is down because of some phone bill problems but we should be up soon. I'm at my friends house now. 

@Joe. Yep. You're in.  

@Martin. Don't worry.  And I got it. You're in. 

@Adhesive_Boy: Yea that was kind of the idea. Short and sweet. I think that's better than 10 levels in one month lol. 

And no the contest hasn't started yet. I think I'll officially start it October 1st. You might find that strange because people who start competing early would get a head start but the time limit isn't meant to make people hurry, it's meant to keep it from going on forever. So if someone submits their level on October 31st, it'll still be good. Judging will probably last a few days. I don't know yet. It will definitely start on November 1st. I'll discuss it with the other judges. 

So... are you in?

I have one question for each of the participants and judges: 

For all purposes, what do you want to be called? 

If I get no answer it will be as it is in the list above (initial post).

Ok you're in. Also a homey named Ross has been added. Annnnnnnnnd Arielus contacted me recently and suggested some stuff. 

First he suggested that we put the levels in a compilation which will happen (unless someone doesn't want their levels included... if so contact me.) 

Secondly which may be tough to implement. He suggested that, to make the compilation run smoothly as a six episode game (which is a beautiful idea), that we have the mappers choose to either create a set of opening levels (you escape, you enter, you airdrop... you know, a level that would be the first level of an episode.), a set of regular levels (levels that would be in between and have no finishing bosses (you could have ones like Hans and Gretel [hahahahaha] but no Hitler, Otto, etc.), or a set of finishing levels... which are basically boss levels or levels that end the episode. 

Now there are only two reasons that I wouldn't want to do this: 1) Some of you may be too far into your levels (but it's only 3). and 2) Too restrictive (but it's really not). 

Now you guys are gonna have to tell me what you want and be quick about it because this needs to be decided quick before it gets off the ground.

I might join, it's hard to say (I suck at predicting the future, but it's something I'm sometimes really interested in; so who knows...). How's that for reassurance?  

Gotta like the idea of having an opening, middle and closing level. Some people think that an opening level should start your adventure and a closing level should conclude it; that's pretty funny. A 6-episode compiliation might be cool, I think it all depends on what is submitted and who organizes the conflicts / loose-ends. Making collections flow nicely is something I always like to consider, and something I know Jack is certainly good at.  

Another thing I've been having a craving for lately is to make a really advanced level generator (perhaps internally in the exe so you won't be able to see the levels before you play). Something that can make a level that will always surprise you, and can also adapt to people's personal level styles. Select the quality of a B.J. Rowan / Gary Ragland level but with some Temporary Insanity style twists - for example. 

Just out of curiosity, can the players also be judges? I think it would cool to see what everyone thought of each other's levels, especially the ones making the levels. Maybe we can make our own 'sub-judges cult' that don't really count for points, or something... haha.

Ok well the contest is starting today so we'll just stick with the old rules. I probably would have gone with Ariel's suggestions but our modem crapped out so I can't get online at home. I can still do my job because I have school and my friends houses so don't worry about that. Besides we're buying a new modem this weekend. 

So yes. It starts today. Send your maps to me: Wolfendude87@aol.com 

Have fun!  

@Chris: You can still come in at any time during the month. They just have to be in by 11-1.

This contest is becoming more and more interesting as the days go by. New people are writing their names down on the participants list, and little by little it is growing longer and longer. I don't know about the rest, but I become more excited about this thing every time a new wolfer enters. 

As I have already said to some people, there's no better closure to this event than the construction of a compilation. Particularly, I have already started my trilogy, and I'm doing my best in order to win a place within the ultimate selection. I too hope everyone does the same. 

Some days before this started, I sent one of the judges, more precisely Zach, a message with some suggestions. He took the time to write them here himself, for everyone to read. Fact is, I again have some ideas that I'd like to share with you. I appreciate what Zach did, and I wouldn't like to bother him again, so this time, I'll put my thoughts here myself: 


So far, we've got three judges. I'm not saying there shouldn't be more, anyone is welcome to join the judges board, as this contest is not of my property; yet I believe that three is, apart from a nice number, enough. Only within this hypothetical example, let us suppose the three actual judges are the only ones who will ultimately decide what levels get into the compilation. 

We haven't been yet told exactly within what files we will have to submit our levels. We yet don't know whether we'll have to submit both the GAMEMAPS and MAPHEAD files, or whether we'll have to extract the levels with MapEdit, and submit them in three separate files of 16KB each. We only know that we have to send our 3-level contribution to Zach's e-mail address. 

The idea which motivated this message came up after meditating the doubts mentioned on the paragraph above. Any way we send Zach -or any of the judges- our levels, he/they will know that it was exactly us who made them. When he/they plays/play any level, he/they will know exactly what person was behind its development. I'm not saying this is a complete bad idea, but, if you permit me, I think I have a better one, which could perhaps make things a bit more interesting. 

I suggest a fourth person takes part here, neither a judge nor a mapper. I say this fourth person -and only this fourth person- receives all the maps and erases in each of them -if present- the name of its creator and any other text. Then, I say this person places all the maps in a random and disarranged way into one pair (or more, depending on the quantity of levels sent it) of GAMEMAPS and MAPHEAD files - this can be done with MapEdit, as probably many of you know, by exporting the maps to single 16KB files and then importing them onto the two files named above. And then -only then- send them to the three judges. This fourth person should keep, however, record of who made each level contained in the disarranged set he sent to the three judges; as well as a copy of all the original files submitted by the participants in the first place. In this way, none of the judges would know whose is the level they are playing. 

Once time expires and the number of levels submitted is known and unmovable, the judges will know -if they don't know already- exactly how many levels the compilation will have, and of what type (opening, normal, or closing). The three of them would play through the whole disarranged set, and would select all the levels which they consider should have a place within the definite Map Making Mania Melee compilation. 

After deciding, they would tell the fourth person exactly which levels they've picked by naming the corresponding episode and floor in the disarranged set. This person would evaluate the three different lists of votes, and determine which levels have received more votes than the rest throughout the three different lists of votes. He will know beforehand how many -but will now know exactly which- levels will be taken from the original files submitted by the participants. As this fourth one will have a record of who made everything in the disarranged set, he will have no problem in finding the chosen levels among the original files submitted. 

Once this is done, our fourth friend would put all the selected levels into a brand new pair of GAMEMAPS and MAPHEAD files, though this time the original ones, with their creator's name on them, as well as any other text present at the time they were submitted. Because of this is necessary that this person keeps a copy of everything. 

This brand new pair of GAMEMAPS and MAPHEAD files would then travel to the three judges; and then, with only the chosen levels to deal with, they would be able to discuss things among themselves and finally build the compilation. 


Well, this is my idea. I believe that if the judges do not know who made what they have chosen, things can get more interesting; and unexpected but cool results can come afloat. 

That's it. Hope you like and agree on this. I'll better open up MapEdit again now, I still have a lot to work on! 


Ariel.

Wow Ariel, man... not knowing who did which levels when they judge them would make so much sense; they'd have to base everything on the levels themselves nomatter what. That's the perfect way to do it! Hell, since you came up with this awesome idea - I think YOU should be the guy who gets sent all the levels and compiles everything for the judges; I don't see why the person who keeps all the levels can't be one of the people who sends in levels... it wouldn't matter, because the other 3 judges won't know which levels are yours till the end, when they announce the winners, and than you'll tell who's who; right?  

If it's an issue of honesty, and you can't do it; I'd be glad to volunteer to keep everyones levels and send them off the to the big boys when the time is right. Since not everyone uses Mapedit, I think sending a Gamemaps/Maphead file would the best call here... that way we can know which episode (music, ceiling colours) they based their levels around as well. Having the 4th guy throw it into a scrambled, mixed set beforehand could work too; I'm sure. That would probably be an even cooler way of doing it - all depends on if the judges want to rate each level individually too I guess. 

Sounds like you're really pashionate about this contest dude, and that's great to hear! Man, if everyone else is going to have the great spirit that you do... this contest is going to TOTALLY BLOW AWAY ALL THE CONTESTS EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF WOLF3D!!! bwa ha ha ha ha ha HA. Oh yeah!  

Good luck to all of you crazy Level Making Machines! lol...

I agree, Ariel has some great ideas about this. That's great! 

Ok how about this? - This is based on your ideas - We have the extra "middle-man" who everyone sends their files to. He takes the files and makes them anonymous (one way or another) and sends them to the judges and we judge them without any prejudice whatsoever. Nice  

And about the compilation. We'll work something out then. 

So Ariel if you want to be this middle-man it's fine with me but it sounds like you're making maps already. I'm fine with Chris taking the job too. It doesn't matter to me.

Honestly talking? I would love to be the extra 'middle-man'. Yeah, I would love to receive all the sets, arrange the levels and send them away. I would. 

And yes, I have already started my trilogy of levels; but, as Chris wisely pointed out, that wouldn't mind anyway. Even though I'd be the one who would send the levels to the judges, you wouldn't have to know which three of those levels are mine. 

I've been talking with Chris, and he said to me it'd be fine with him if I took the job; he wouldn't have any problem with that. So well, I'll be pleased to do it if everybody agrees. I'll do a good job, you can rely on that.  

Please, give me a confirmation, and if this is finally gonna be done this way, and I'll post here an email address where the 3-level sets should be sent in. 


Take care all, 

Ariel.

Yeah, that sounds cool to me... how bout to everyone else? I'm glad you liked the idea of the anonymous factor Zach; heh. Also, I think that the 'middle-man' (Ariel, I'm assuming) should PM everyone who hasn't submitted their levels by, say... 2-5 days before the contest is over; just to make sure that they're still participating; giving them some encouragement and telling them where to send their files (just incase they didn't read up on things here). 

Well, I hope that alot of the people that 'confirmed' to be in this contest are still considering to submit their level experiments - because this battle will be alot more fun with more people; and will make the compilation even cooler to play through when it's out. I guess if anyone still sends their files to you Zach, the honest thing would be to forward them to Ariel's account - and than either delete them or just keep them closed up somewhere until the judging dates are over... but it's totally your call; since you had the awesome idea for this contest in the first place.

Alright! So, we are doing things this way. I am taking the 'middle-man' job. Great! 

Ok, the 3-level sets should be sent in to: arielus1982@argentina.com. From the ones I've got, this account is the best to receive and handle packages; so everything should -and will- go fine. 

Do not worry. I will right away start sendind private messages and also e-mails to the confirmed participants, to make sure all of them know how things are gonna be done now. If new contestants turn up in the future, they will read this, and thus know about the current rules. 

Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! This is gonna be sweet!

So... October is halfway gone. How are the maps coming? Remember it's only three maps... and they don't have to be brand new either (They can't be something from an existing set of course ). Anyways, we have someone new competing. He wants to be called "The J.R." so yeah. That's cool. 

Good luck.

Same here, though I haven't finished anything yet. There's still plenty of time, so I'm very likely to modify, modify again, and keep modifying over and over again what I've got until I am completely satisfied. 

A while has passed since I informed the participants about the current rules, and even though the situation can be read here, I simply cannot resist the temptation to remind you all once again: The organisers of this event have agreed that the 3-level sets must be sent in to me, at arielus1982@argentina.com. It's been decided that I carefully handle the files, and then deliver them to the judges; basically, for them not to know who made each thing, and get more interesting results from the judging process. 


Still 10 days, come on up guys! Take your time and do your best! 

Ariel.

Alright, I am done with my contribution; there is even still a while for me to polish things, so happily everything went well here. Honestly talking, I didn't have much to do during this month: only one exam, but no big deal; so I guess I was lucky... 

I have also received three three-level sets so far. As there are still some days left, I told these people that they may feel totally free to re-send me their contributions if they feel like changing something; I won't mind at all. 

Also, one of the contestants told me some days ago that he wouldn't be able to make it, as he had had other things to attend to; and now I see Martin and Tristan are delayed as well... 

I was thinking, maybe one week more wouldn't hurt, would it? These people who have already sent me their work would have a little more time to think about changing it and re-sending me improved versions; and those who definitely won't make it at all would have the chance to do it on time. 

Anyway, it's up to you judges. 


Ariel.

So be it! I'll give you guys two more weeks. But don't get it into your heads that'll I'll keep extending until eternity because it's not true!  

Nov. 14 is now the deadline. 

Good luck!

Thanks man! It will help a lot. I finished my stuff but it needs some more tweaks so the maps will be better. A lot better!

This thread has been very quiet for over 10 days now.  Is this thing still happening? I am REALLY looking forward to eventually playing whatever is contributed, so I hope you people are sending in your maps.

Hopefully it's because the deadline for the levels has been extended to Nov 14. 

To those who are contributing please send in your completed levels to Ariel by that time.

Alright people! It's already Nov. 14th here and in exactly 5 hours it'll be Nov. 15th. So far, 5 people have sent me their 3-level sets, and a 6th wolfer has submitted only one level. His responsibilites made it impossible for him to make 3 maps, and as he understood something was better than nothing, he decided to keep his word and deliver what he had been able to complete. 

If you add my 3-level set, then it's 19 maps so far. I believe it is a nice number of levels, though also a little small if we take into account all the people who originally wrote their names down on the participants' list. Two of the 5 people I've mentioned above are not really confirmed participants, they decided to remain silent and work on their levels without having the obligation to. In other words, they didn't rush their mouth at the very beginning and sent me their maps when they were ready, but without having any "moral" obligation to do so. So, we are having 6 maps which we wouldn't have originally had, thanks to these two great wolfers. I hope I'm explaining things clearly here... Count 'em for yourselves, and if you forget about the wolfer who sent only one level, you'll see that 8 (eight!) people have submitted nothing so far. 

Oh, well... I just wanted to say that I'll wait until it's Nov. 15th here and then send everything to the judges... As I've always said, I just hope a good compilation add-on gets built outta this. 

Ariel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Considering each player was assigned an opening / closing level; and that the original game has 6 episodes - it's safe to say that the amount of contestants that decided to submit their packs would be the PERFECT number for a compilation (having 3 levels [one set] per episode)! I guess you can always throw that 1 extra level into a secret level of one of the episodes; with the permission of the person who made that episode of course. 

This is sounding really good man! I can't wait to see which people submitted their levels, what kind of styles/ideas they used, and which ones came up on top from the judge's perspectives. If anyone deserves to win this contest though, it's definately you Ariel (especially for your help in making Zach's contest a reality)! Good luck to all of you who participated; I'm anxiously awaiting to play and see the results of all your mini level sets... heheh.

Done. All the 3-level sets have been sent to the judges inside pairs of GAMEMAPS.WL6 & MAPHEAD.WL6 files. Let the judging begin, fellows. 

Thanks for those words, Chris; though I wouldn't vote for me if I were you... I couldn't help playing the others' maps, and believe me: There are many great maps here. The judges will have a difficult task - no doubt about it!

Goddamn Chris. Are you trying to get a rise out of me?  Seriously... "thanks for making Zach's contest a reality." Well yeah I guess all those people that came before Ariel joined the team were fake huh? 

Anyways... I knew this was going to happen. 

Ariel has sent us me the maps and I'll be juding them tommorrow. 

Thank you for all the people that took the time and labor to create the maps and make this a reality. Much appreciated. As for the others... geez...

Absolutely. There will be a compilation of all the levels after the judging.

Erhh... I just wanted to say that I may have sounded a little bit too 'unbearable' in my latest posts here; I've noticed so and I'd like to say it hasn't actually been my intention. I suppose I took this contest somehow too seriously from the very beginning, and specially when I was assigned the 'middle man' job; I couldn't help keep thinking that we would get tons and tons of levels. That was my real hope indeed, and I guess I never considered the possibility of so many people stepping away. 

I cannot blame anybody, seriously. I am still a little angry at myself for not having submitted a thing for Eric Vaughn's contest early this year, even though the only one who participated there was Ack. I had said I would do it and the fact of having had to step away really bothered me... Because of that, I put all my heart in this one, I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world... That's the way I feel things... I don't know... I simply hate saying I'm gonna do something and then end up doing nothing. It's a moral question... I don't know... I just believe one's word is very important, for I don't like at all when people do not trust my credibilty. Oh well... That is just me... 

No doubt: Real life comes before Wolf. I can totally understand that non-computer-related obligations can make you have to leave out the computer-related ones. I know that because that is actually what happened to me during Eric's competition. 

So, that's all. Sorry if I sounded aggressive, or offensive; as I said, I didn't mean to. Anyway, now that the judges have received the contributions, it won't be long until we finally know the event's results, and I'm glad for that. 

Ariel.

I think my South American friend is being a little hard on himself. There is a difference between being unbearable and passionate. We call ourselves 'die hard wolfers' for a reason - we are die hards!  
Since there is a lot of talent in this community, I, like many, was looking forward to playing some of the best levels that the mappers had to offer. But, if people can't be bothered to keep their word, what can you do? I'm sure we will hear our fair share of lame excuses, but since Zach announced this contest on the 15th of September, that has given everyone practially two months. Three maps in two months? I think that anyone who put in an effort to run this contest or to enter has a right to be a little upset. I felt like I wasted my time entering Eric's contest and I obviously wasted my time (to some degree) sending in three maps for this one (I was one of the mystery contestants). Needless to say, I am going to think twice before doing this again. 

Fool me once, shame on you 
Fool me twice, shame on me. 

I do want to thank the five other guys who sent in their maps. Also want to thank Zach for attempting this in the first place. 

Peace

Sorry Zach, I didn't realize my comment could have been taken offensively; but all I really meant was that all the messages on this board can be a piece of inspiration for others to join (the comments by Ariel, Schabbs, ack, etc.). Not only that, many people have also talked to me about the contest through other methods alot, or have posted news related stuff about it elsewhere - with hopes to recruit more people. I'm just really impressed with the spirit some people have put forth... and you've obviously done a great job putting all this together Zach; I didn't mean to take anything away from you. 

Well, ack, maybe you're not too overjoyed from submitting your levels for this contest (and the one by Eric Vaughn); but I certainly am - and I'm sure there are others that feel the same way I do about your work. You know, I've always dreamed of having a 6-episode set with people like you, Arielus, Jack Ryerson, Gary Ragland, myself, and someone else (perhaps B.J. Rowan?) all doing an episode for it. So far, this is the closest thing I've ever come across to that vision; and even though all 6 sets will only have 3 levels - this contest still really excites me. 

As you've might have figured out by now, I've also submitted 3 levels. They're not entirely new (some were lost Chokage creations or experiments that I just never got around to finishing), but this contest has given me the inspiration to going back and making them closer to what I always wanted from them; so I'm really thankful to have had the ambition and oppurtunity to do something like this (with some of my favorite level makers too; sweet!). Hopefully my contribution will be enough to keep this contest as unique and interesting as a 3-level contest could be; but if they're not... you can always just keep playing around with the other 5 great sets! Have fun!

Wow.. 

Everything that has been posted here as of late has taken me as quite touching. I feel the guilt swelling up in me for not doing as much as I should have, having not contributed as much as all the other Wolfers. I suppose maybe I should not have joined up in the first place with this contest. Yet I did enjoy the work I did, though how little was done. 

Ariel, you are being a bit rough on yourself. Only a bit, though.  But seriously: You shouldn't stack so much of this on yourself. You actually contributed three maps and you were the 'middle-man.' That's far more than I did, and you should be proud of yourself. I'm sure all the other Wolfers are proud of you.

Yeah I really had a feeling this was going to be big. What can I say? I mean, you can't force people to do it... can you? (hm..... lol jk). But yeah... bummer man. I'm sorry if I was immature to Chris or Ariel. Ariel did certainly add to the spirit and the excitement (especially with his ideas) which is part of the reason I felt this was going to be big. 

I agree with Ack... I mean... almost a month and a half for 3 maps... c'mon. I bet there are no lameass excuses because that's a long time. 

Yeah, Ariel don't be hard on yourself. You did nothing wrong. 

And Ack, the fact that the maps exist is awesome. If you hadn't created the maps they wouldn't be around for people to enjoy right? So you shouldn't act like it was a waste of time because, really, the maps exist because of this. 

It's a frikin shame this has to feel like a funeral.  

So Ariel, who were the people who submitted the maps? I just need to know for the credits.

@ Zach - Hey man, I agree with you across the board aside from one thing. I said it was a waste of time - ***to some degree*** Your contest was worth entering and I am glad that I did and I am really glad that a few other guys threw in their maps as well. My frustration is the same as yours... people not keeping their word, which was the basis of my 'waste of time' comment. Don't want you to think that I have a bad attitude

Woah...some tension in here. But two can play that game. Ok...the situation is as follows. I was late. I haven't made anything. I haven't had the time. You can take that as a lame-ass excuse. Hate me. Despise me. Boycot me. Do whatever you may please. Frankly, I don't really give a rat's ass what your opinions may be. I couldn't make it. Simple. From where I stand, I don't need a friggin' reason, 'cuz simply none of them will be accepted. And that's fine. Good words for the contest: T'was a good idea. Nice it worked out. Just not for me. 

Enjoy. 

Tvp Out.

Hey-hey, now.. Nobody is pointing fingers at anyone, here. Really, now.. That outburst wasn't entirely nececary. I mean, I messed up, too, but I'm not angry with anyone but myself because of it. You'd be amazed what five minutes will do while working on a map, and you know as well as I that we ALL had plenty of time to do this. I can't say that anyone absolutely needed to finish anything, I mean.. this is just a game. Nobody should be worked up at all. All in all, tension or not, it is still merely a game. Nobody needs to be a sore loser because they didn't get to the board in time, if you understand my analogy.

I also wouldn't mind seeing the Map Making Melee compilation someday... if only some one would take the initiative :D

Like you, the Mapping Melee is something that's always been really high on my list of sets to play (since it sounds like it will have a variety of ambitious submissions). It's kind of funny that it's taking this long for the judging, considering that Zach was complaining everywhere about how he couldn't believe that people couldn't meet the November 14th deadline (you'd think it would take less time to judge the levels than actually make them, right?). Oh well, it can't be any worse than Eric Vaughn's hilarious comments in the first competition. Man, reading that old thread and all those rebellious responces was a riot! Seems like Zach has a much better understanding of how to go about this kind of contest than that guy. 

You know, there was a music contest on a forum where 10 people submitted their remixes; and the contestants were waiting on the judges to submit their results for months. So, seeing all the complaints - I just downloaded all 10 songs, analyzed them in great detail (writing everything good and bad about each song); and than posted my results. Of course, I gave them all 1st place, because all the remixes were too awesome to make a list of "Standings"; and the people who checked back were very happily surprised (doesn't seem like they even realize that I'm not actually 'supposed' to be the judge - lol). If you were curious, here's their cool thread. You might have to sign up as a member to read it though; I'm not sure. 

If all else fails, maybe we should just take that route here too, and nominate whichever of the 6 contestants are eager to judge the levels to 'unofficially' submit the details of what they enjoyed in each 3-level set (I'm sure that atleast you, me, and Ariel would be up for the task - along with the original Brian Lowe; of course). I have a strange feeling we'd be more reliable than some of these judges; who seem to post in other threads enough to make it a little suspicious that Martin's "Map Making Melee" comment hasn't been answered yet. I guess it's understandable... they didn't actually make the levels, so why would they care about keeping their word? Gotta love the logic here - lol.

Several weeks have passed since I sent the 19 maps to the three judges. I have the constant pleasure of talking to Brian in a regular basis, thus I know he did finish checking them all and even marked them quite long ago. What's more: He's now even given them a second go. 

Before some days ago, I didn't know what was exactly happening with the other two judges' judging processes. I had e-mailed them some weeks after my delivery was made, and they had both replied they were doing slowly but surely with their task. Some more weeks went by and I contacted them again with the same question... Oh well, here you are, check the e-mails I shared with them and specially with Zach:

Map Making Mania Melée 

People, 

Hey. Listen, I'd like to know how things are going regarding the judging of the levels. Brian finished playing them quite long ago, and he has now even given the whole package a second go. 
How are you Zach and Dugtrio doing with them? Several weeks have passed since I sent you the 19 maps, and I still haven't heard from any of you. Is everything OK? I'd like to know when you are completely done with this, so I can let you know exactly who made each of the levels. 
A line to let me know that this very message has found you well wouldn't bother me, either. 

Until then, take care you all. 

Ariel.

Re: Map Making Mania Melée 

Ariel, 

You're not going to like this... well you might. But I don't like the situation. First of all the lack of participation (and the illusion of a great project) really destroyed my concern for this thing. Then i went through the levels and you really can't make a good full set with that. A few of the sets are great (I bet one of them is Ack's ) but most of the leave something to be desired. So....... I'm leaving it up to you if you want it. I'll relinquish my job as a judge and Brian can be the sole judge (I don't know what's up with Dan). You can take care of the set and everything. If you don't want it I suppose I'll finish it. 

Zach

From: arielus1982@hotmail.com to: WolfenDude87@aol.com 

Re: Map Making Mania Melée 

Zach, 

This is no good news, man; but well, I can understand you anyway. I do think there are more than one good set there, but it's only my opinion. Listen, I'll wait until Dugtrio17 replies the mail, ¿ok? Let me see what he's up to and then I'll let Brian and him know the situation. I will also let you know how things are too. We'll all come to a democratic decision and -in that way- the best for this event. I still believe a nice compilation add-on can be built outta this. 

Take care dude, 

Ariel.

Re: Map Making Mania Melée 

Ariel, 

Alright that sounds good. Has Dan replied to anything lately? I'll try to talk to him next time he's on AIM (Dugtrio17 if you have AIM). 

Later, 
Zach

From: arielus1982@hotmail.com to: WolfenDude87@aol.com 

Re: Map Making Mania Melée 

Zach, 

No, he hasn't replied yet. If you manage to talk to him before he tells me anything, then please let me know how things are going with him, ok? I'll appreciate that. 

Thanks in advance man, 

Ariel. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


There. I believed it was fair for all the contestants plus all the wolfers wondering about this event to know what was really happening. Now you know what the latest news is.

@ Arielus - thanks for being up front with us on what is going on. 

@ Zach - I share your frustration, dude! But waiting around has been getting frustrating too - lol. Hey, who is kidding who? I am just dying to play the Choksta's set  I really don't care if they get judged or who does the judging. I submitted my maps to show some community spirit and don't really care who wins (although I appreciate your compliment). Regardless, I look forward to them coming out eventually.

Alright people... There's some news concerning our event here. On another thread, some days ago, I posted a series of e-mails I had been sharing with the judges, but specially with Zach. I'm sure many of you must've come across that thread and read about the current situation. Ok, there's some more I believe those of you wondering about the Map Making Mania Melée might be interested in knowing. Just some moments ago, I sent an e-mail to all the three judges again, and this is exactly what it said: 


Dear Judges, 

Hello there, I hope you all are fine. Listen, I would like to finish off my job as the contest's 'middle man', and in order to do that, I've prepared a package for you. This, in no way, is something to rush you; it is something only to conclude my task. I feel the need to conclude what I started - that's all. I will do this and then let you work freely from now on... 

Onto this very e-mail, I've attached a file called 'CONTEST.ZIP'. Inside of it, you will find several things. Each of you should only see these things if you are completely done with your corresponding judging process, and not before. At the moment I am writing this, I know you, Brian, have finished yours; but I don't know whether you, Dan and Zach, have. So, please, proceed only if you are done like Brian is. 

Alright, first... There are 3 text files which will let you know exactly what each of you judged. You will see how I arranged the maps for each of you, and who made each of those maps. I thought each of you might find it interesting to know exactly the way in which the other two judges played; so well, there you go... 

Second: There is a file called '[ All The Ingredients ].ZIP'. This file contains a GAMEMAPS.WL6 & MAPHEAD.WL6 pair of files, along with another text file. Details about everything are included within the mentioned text file, so please, make sure you read it. 

That is all. Once more: All this is not something to rush you, but something to finish off my responsibility and let you go on freely. I hope you can download 'CONTEST.ZIP' correctly. 

It's all up to you now. Bye! 

Ariel. 


There. I guess I need not explain much, right? I mean, everything is on the mail, isn't it? To conclude, I would only like to say that I am sorry if I behaved too unbearably about this whole event. I suppose I put way too much passion into it... Anyway, I hope I've been somehow useful, and in a way contributed to a better Map Making Mania Melée. My intentions were always the best. 

Ariel.

Brother.... that passion to which you refer is what makes us all Die Hard Wolfers in the first place. You did your job, so I don't see the need for the apology - JMHO 

And to repeatedly beat a dead horse.... 

Could someone tell me if the contest has been completely cancelled? I can live with that. I would like to use my three maps in another project -IF- this compilation is never going to be released.

This leads to the thread: 

http://diehardwolfers.areyep.com/viewtopic.php?t=1157&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0 

What you are looking for is on its second page, though. I hope you don't mind my having posted an e-mail from you there, which was intended to be read by me only; I know I perhaps should've asked for your permission before doing it. 

Ariel.

This is straying a little off-topic (probably my fault), but what the heck... 

You know, just my opinion Zach... but I think that quoting an entire message that is already on the same page of the same thread is kinda pointless (which you seem to be doing alot lately); especially if you're only going to contribute one line of text to it. Wouldn't that just make the database size bigger for no reason at all? Also, if being honest and able to carry out your own statements is what you meant, than I'm sorry you can't be like me too; but than again, if you were more like me... you probably wouldn't have ambition to make this cool contest in the first place (seeing as how Eric's contest turned out). Guess you shouldn't be sorry at all about some things, like successfully getting 6 submissions; but what do I know...

I quoted what I felt was necessary and summarized my thoughts. I didn't quote the whole post. Besides I don't think it makes much of a difference. If you're worried about taking up space maybe you should summarize huh?  

You know, it just sucks how I'm getting flak for not doing my job or whatever. Me not doing my job? 6 entries x 3 maps + Joe's 1 = 19 levels. 19 LEVELS out of what would have been 39. Half... some of which weren't that great. 

I guess I saw the cup as being half empty but I don't give a shiz about the thing anymore! It won't make a good compilation. It won't make a popular compilation. It'll barely make a compilation! The whole thing is embarassing to me. I made all that hype for nothing so I don't like hearing people criticize my work ethic. 

You didn't start the competition so I really don't want to hear it. Ariel can handle it, because he wants to. I don't. That's the difference. I don't have an obligation to anyone or anything. Maybe if I was the only one interested in the project or the only judge or something. But I'm not. 

Sorry for the bitterness and off-topicness but this is how I feel about it.

Yeah, I was actually expecting alot more submissions too; mainly because of how many people "claimed" that they were going to participate - like you were saying earlier. I think I've been being a little too hard on alot of people lately for stupid things (Codetech, Zeta Burn, AReyeP, you), and I'm sorry about that. And you're right, I always describe things to a ridiculous amount so people will be able to see where I'm coming from... and maybe it's not a good way of doing things. I guess it would have been better for everyone if our comments to each other were in a Private Message. If I ever want to say anything next time... I'll take that route instead (even though it didn't seem to get any feedback from you before - but I guess the reasons for that have been cleared up with your latest comments). 

Well, my addon anticipations are still the same; if anyone else wants to elaborate on that instead. I would also really like to see some kind of old alpha copy of thejosh's Wolenstein Bloopers - that would be sweet; but I won't push my luck there (who knows, perhaps it doesn't even exist anymore)! Maybe I'll check out "The Wrath of Mr. Freeze" this week, just for fun.

News concerning the Map Making Mania Melée has been posted on its corresponding thread. I believe it's just not the right time to say what's gonna happen to the event; at least, not for now. I don't think I should be the one who handles things, Zach, as Brian is still one of the judges; and Dan, despite carrying out his job in a slowly way, is still in too. I would like to think that my job regarding this has already finished. Again, for those of you who have not yet read it, there's something new to check at the contest's thread... 

Now, back on topic here... 

There are many Spear/Wolf mods I like a lot; however, at the moment I am writing this, there's one I like better than any other, and it's Spear Resurrection, as I've repeatedly said. I believe it is the best one to date, and hence I can't help but thinking -and deeply hoping- that its sequel, End of Destiny, is going to rock as well. Definitely, that one is the mod I'm anticipating more than any other. 

Ariel.

This 'Map Making Mania Melee' contest has been dragging on for some time now. I've emailed the other 2 judges and have had no response. I finished the judging of the levels long ago but it did not give a clear winner. Two entrants had exactly the same highest scores. 

The question is now, where do we go from here? 

I could release the set with my comments but I'd like to know from the entrants the best way to do this. Should the 6 entrants who did 3 levels each have their levels together in one episode, making 6 in all (one episode would also have the single level made by Joe)? 

Any feedback would be welcome. Also, if Zach or Dugtrio have any comments or results could they please let me know.

Well, Zach has let it be known that he has shucked the responsibility of the contest (and I understand his reasons). I guess that leaves it up to you and dugtrio17. Should we not hear from dugtrio17 within a reasonable time, I guess we should accept your judging and leave it at that. Just a suggestion. 

Using the six sets as six different episodes makes sense. I was talking to Chris, and he mentioned that his trio of levels includes one which contains a secret elevator. Perhaps Joe's level could be the secret level in Chris' set? I also have a secret elevator in my trio of levels. Perhaps you could take my second level and make it the secret level for that episode? That might make the two episodes play better. Just a suggestion

I also believe that having five episodes with 3 levels each, plus one episode with 4 levels is the most appropriate way to organise things. I think each episode should have the three maps from the contestant picked for that episode, and Joe's single submission should be placed in any of them. ack's suggestions on how to place Joe's map amidst Chris's are perfect, from my point of view, and the way in which he wants his three maps sorted is completely doable as well; thus, I believe things should be done like that, unless someone has a better idea. 

Particularly, I don't mind in which episode number my three maps are located, but I believe it would be nice if they were all placed in their original order, that is, first the opening one, then the middle one, and finally the boss one. 

Ariel.

Thanks Ack and Ariel for the feedback. There's good ideas in both posts. I'll get something done today on a levels format using the ideas mentioned and post more details on the format when it's done. Then the entrants (plus Zach and Dugtrio if they want) can say if they'd like anything changed.

Here's a possible format I put together for the Mapping Melee set. 

Episode 1 - 3 levels by Arielus 
Episode 2 - 3 levels by Ack, plus Joe's level as the secret one 
Episode 3 - 3 levels by Bernt Hansen, plus a small end level on level 4 
Episode 4 - 3 levels by Martin 
Episode 5 - 3 levels by David O 'Rafferty 
Episode 6 - 3 levels by Chris, plus a spare level (left over from the Tribute set) by Harry Mass Senior on level 4 

Please let me know if anyone thinks anything should be changed.

Sounds great to me Brian. I like the idea of having some "extra" special secret levels. I'm sure they'll add to the variety and fun of the package.  

Man, I wish I would have participated in the Bucksnort Tribute set; but I only had the library as a resource for the internet at the time. It's always cool to see all the others that have participated to make that tribute a success; and that there is actually even more levels that weren't able to make it in there. 

Nothing beats seeing people making levels purely for the original game though, I believe, so I can't wait to how this compilation turns out. Not sure how each episode will blend in with the given environments, but this layout sounds quite compatible and interesting - and you don't need permission from me. I trust your judgement.

Same here. Everything's perfect, as I see it. Can't wait to see this mod on the streets already!

1. By this or a specified time; before: The children were already asleep when we got home. 
2. So soon: Are you quitting already? 
3. Nonstandard. Used as an intensive: Be quiet already. Enough already. 

I wonder which version Ariel was referring to. They would all make sense in that sentance; wouldn't they? Help me out here, your english skills are much better than mine Ariel (which is pretty sad, considering that it's my first language). :D

Thanks everyone for the feedback. I'm checking all the levels to make sure they're compatible with the ceiling colours. Episodes 1 to 3 seem ok. Once I've checked the other 3 episodes, if they look right, I'll post the set on the Dome News and here in a couple days.
