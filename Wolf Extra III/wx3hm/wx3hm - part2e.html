			You may now clean out both the roof and the ground floor in what order you choose. 
Be prepared for some heavy action. In both places a super officer will leave you 
a chaingun. Cleaning out the ground floor is not necessary. Grosse on the roof will 
leave you the silver key. Try to hurt him when he is near the barrels by blowing 
them up.

			Go past the silver door in the basement and the "dead guard trick" which will 
block the retreat. Don't let the nearby mutants surprise you. Pick some ammo but 
watch the bomb.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 277-32, 378-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Now fight for your life against the Ubermutant and the mutants in this area. Find 
powerups in several rooms. The Ubermutant will leave you the gold key. Again try 
to hurt him when he is near the barrels.

			Locate this cross behind a secret door.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 406-32, 321-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Get past the death chalice behind this secret door and get back past this gold 
door.
