			You can go down to the ground floor and clean it out although that is something 
you may do later. It is not necessary to do at all but you will probably gain some 
ammo from it.

pistol, if you have not already done so.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 56-32, 399-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Then choose the chaingun and start the fight by going through this door. Remember 
that both the green and the yellow ghost may be around.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 42-32, 147-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			It is an especially good reason to perform the last described operation at this 
point if the red ghost was a nuisance on the floor above. You may then make a detour 
and trick it into this room where it will probably stay while you reenter the central 
part of floor 2.
