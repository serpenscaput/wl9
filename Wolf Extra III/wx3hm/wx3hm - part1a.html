			You start here. If you wait a little the nearest guard will have turned and the 
other will be out of sight when you enter the hallway. Take out both with your knife.

			You may want to try to clean out these two rooms right away especially to get 
the health chalices in the upper room. But bear in mind: To grab ammo when you don't 
have the chance to use it may prove very unwise.

			Finish these two guards to clear the way to the elevator to the basement. Watch 
out for the bomb among the ammo clips when you pick them up later.

			Locate this secret door and take out the officer. Get the health chalice but make 
sure the nearby enemies don't notice you.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 119-32, 252-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Watch out for the bomb, and finish off the guard. Then run past the officers and 
take with you the cross before entering the elvator to the next floor.
