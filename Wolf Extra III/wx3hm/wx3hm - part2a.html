			You start here. Move a little to the right to avoid being noticed by the first 
three patrollong SS. Watch them past the cyan steel box as they move away from you.

			When they have reached sufficently far make it over here without being noticed. 
Knife down the fist "sub" mutant on the way, but don't linger, a second trio of patrolling 
SS will soon be in sight. Make it to the health chalices before finishing off the 
second "sub" mutant.

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 53-32, 340-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Watch the second trio pass by from this corner.

			Then follow them cautiously to get to the elevator to the basement, or...

			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 42-32, 271-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			... stop by here to do away with the two other "sub" mutants on this floor and 
to get some more health. Notice the bronze key behind the column. Now you will have 
to have all six SS pass by before making it to the basement elevator.
