			You need to follow the ghost guard through the silver door near the elevator at 
the north east corner of the floor. And you need to take the cross with you found 
in the room with the yellow ghost. There are several ways to do it but you have to 
time it right. Here is one way:
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 112-32, 245-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Wait a few seconds after the ghost guard has gone through this door (the upper 
one).
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 42-32, 308-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Then open the door to this room. The yellow ghost will come at you immediately.

			</p>			
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 175-32, 273-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Run here but don't wait for the ghost to come through one of the two doors.
			</p>			
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 42-32, 308-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Run to this room, get the cross and go out of the room. Wait for the ghost to 
come as near as you find vise..
			</p>			
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 182-32, 259-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			..then run back her just in time to follow the ghost guard through the silver 
door. You will now make it into the elevator before the yellow ghost catch you. Take 
the health chalices on the way.
