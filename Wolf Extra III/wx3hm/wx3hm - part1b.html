			Drop the two guards by the elevators and the four moving round the main hallway, 
still using your knife.

			You will notice a cross here. Don't take it now!

			<p class="normal">
			You are now able to to go up to the roof through the elevator in the south east 
corner. But there are no particularly good reasons to do so.
			Especially not if you have collected a good amount of ammo. You don't have much 
chance to stay alive on the roof if you make a sound at this state, and when you 
go down again you will lose the ammo, as you will later learn.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 133-32, 245-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			Go down to the ground floor again and find yourself here. Fighting the three officers 
you ran past previously will most probably prove fatal.
			</p>
			
			<p class="highlight" onMouseOver="showCircle('circle', 83-32, 405-32)" onMouseOut="hideCircle('circle')">

			The best thing to do is to make a run for the elevator to the basement. Pick up 
the nearby ammo but watch the bomb. Holding a cross you may now enter the elevator 
and take the death chalice.
