^C[Gold]BRINGING DOWN THE HAUS
^c[White]Even the prototype "Tiger II" tank, the most powerful armored vehicle ever 
built, could stop your escape from Totenhaus. As the burning fuel from your flamethrower 
ignites its magazines, its turret blasts apart, raining shrapnel and debris onto 
the outer courtyard.

Behind you the mansion is burning. Its priceless treasures and rare artworks will 
never be recovered, but at least the dissidents and Allied operatives murdered in 
its depths have been avenged.
