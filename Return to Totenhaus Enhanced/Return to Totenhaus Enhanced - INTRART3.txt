^C[Gold]NEARING THE END
^c[White]At last you have arrived at the executive wing, where the elevator that 
will take you to the mansion's outer courtyard is located. Freedom is so close you 
can taste it. But it won't come easily...

^C[Gold]ONE WAY OUT
^c[White]The executive wing is guarded by Totenhaus' commandant, SS-Oberfuhrer Jurgen 
Luftmensch. He's loaded for bear and will turn you into pink mist if he catches you 
in the open.

The Nazis are on full alert and paratroopers are fanning out throughout the area 
to find you. Good luck--you'll need it!
