^C[Gold]MOVING UP IN THE WORLD
^c[White]You race up the stairs to the next floor, Fallschirmjaeger paratroopers 
in hot pursuit. All of Totenhaus is alerted to your escape now, and the Nazis will 
make every effort to apprehend or kill you.

You can hear foosteps approaching as you reach the fourth floor. Things just don't 
get any easier, do they?

^C[Gold]THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME
^c[White]The fourth floor is guarded by General Lukas Jaeger, the finest hunter and 
marksman in the Third Reich. His twin match-grade Lugers might seem unimpressive, 
but his accuracy more than makes up for it--he'll put a bullet in your head no matter 
the distance!

To get the key needed to reach the upper levels of Totenhaus, you'll need to kill 
him--but who will be the hunter, and who will be the prey?
