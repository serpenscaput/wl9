^P
^C[Gold]WELCOME

^c[White]Thank you for downloading Return to Totenhaus Enhanced Edition, a revised 
and upgraded standalone version of the expansion pack I released for the ECWolf Tech 
Demo in 2013. As the original Tech Demo maps are going to become part of my upcoming 
Eisenfaust Unleashed as a prologue chapter, I have decided to split off Totenhaus 
into its own mod and give it some updates.
^P
^c[White]As you may have surmised, Return to Totenhaus is inspired by Laz Rojas' 
classic 1996 mod for the Mac version of Wolfenstein (later ported to Doom and the 
PC version) Escape from Totenhaus. When I first saw Escape from Totenhaus on Laz's 
site in 1997, I was amazed and wanted to play it for myself--but alas, it was for 
the Mac only and it was many long years before it would be available on the PC.

^c[White]Laz Rojas' Mac and WolfenDoom mods were a major influence on my own style. 
His imagination and professionalism were far ahead of the PC scene of '96-97. I feel 

^P
^c[White]that Escape from Totenhaus is his greatest work and for a long time wanted 
to do my own interpretation of it.

^c[White]I developed Return to Totenhaus in the spring of 2013, a few months after 
the Tech Demo, as both a demonstration of ECWolf's ability to load multiple mods 
at once and practice at developing the skills to make larger maps--skills I would 
need for Operation Serpent. The original release was on June 16, 2013. Perhaps due 
to the requirement to load both Totenhaus and the Tech Demo, or some heated arguments 
that I had with certain members of the

^P
^c[White]community, or perhaps my mapping style having been compromised by merging 
it with Laz Rojas' style, its release did not get much attention and I felt like 
the project had been a failure.

^c[White]Fast forward to November 2015, and after the mostly successful release of 
Operation Serpent, I had planned to do a Christmas-themed add-on level, but circumstances 
prevented me from getting the appropriate Christmas themed sprites. However, I still 
wanted to make a little Christmas gift for the community. At the time I was replaying 
the Tech Demo and
^P
^c[White]Totenhaus, and I realized that Totenhaus was much better than I had remembered 
it being. I knew immediately what I had to do.

^c[White]I started working on interface graphics for a refresh of Totenhaus, and 
posted some screenshots up on Diehard Wolfers to immediate acclaim. I replaced the 
Wehrmacht guards with exclusive ones WSJ had given me in 2006 (sorry for sitting 
on them for nine years!), selected new music, added more textures, made some map 
tweaks, and removed its dependency on the Tech Demo. The result is what you have

^P
^c[White]here: ^c[Gold]Return to Totenhaus Enhanced Edition.

^c[White]Thanks to Wildweasel for testing, advice, and pointing me to a repository 
of SNES RPG midis to use for the soundtrack. Thanks also to everyone who enjoyed 
Operation Serpent. (and, uh, sorry about the backpack bug--neither I nor Blzut3 could 
figure out what was causing it in time.)

Happy holidays 2015! See you next year with Coffee Break Episode 2!
^>^c[Gold]Executor
^P
^G16 16 [BLAZE]
^c[White]It is the spring of 1943. The Axis armies in the west are reeling from a 
crushing defeat at El Alamein. Rommel's Afrika Korps is in tatters, making a last 
desperate stand against the British advance in Tunisia, and the Allies are preparing 
for an invasion of Italy to knock one of the Axis Powers out of the war for good.


You are B.J. Blazkowicz, an American spy for the OSS intelligence service, dispatched

^P
^G16 16 [IMST]
^c[White]to western Austria to gather intelligence on German forces near the Italian 
border in advance of the invasion. Your journey led you to Imst, a small, sleepy 
town in the province of Tyrol, sandwiched between Italy and Bavaria.

You've become a regular at a local beer hall frequented by German soldiers, posing 
as a local drunk who comes for the food, beer, buxom Fraulieinen, and Gemutlichkeit, 
while secretly recording the conversations of the soldiers. One day, you had a few 


^P
^G16 16 [WATCHING]
^c[White]too many beers, and while chatting with a particularly attractive Fraulein, 
your American accent becomes increasingly obvious.

You are too drunk to notice it at the time, but two German soldiers have gotten up 
from their seats and are heading your way. The serving lady turns to greet the Germans, 
and your gaze follows hers only to glimpse the butt of a Mauser 98 rifle heading 
straight for your face.
^P
^G16 16 [THAUS]
^c[White]You awake, dazed and with a pounding headache, in a dark underground cellar 
lit only by firelight. As you look around, you start to realize where you are and 
your stomach turns over. You sit, bound in ropes, in the basement of the infamous 
Totenhaus.

Totenhaus was originally a chateau owned by the Jewish Grossberg family. The Grossbergs 
were deported to a ghetto and their palatial Bavarian estate seized by the Nazis 
in 1935. Since then, Totenhaus has 
^P
^G16 16 [TKNIFE]
^c[White]has become one of the most notorious prisons for Allied POWs in Southern 
Europe. However, the guards seem to be getting sloppy.

The guard who was supposed to have searched your possessions appears to have left, 
perhaps to clean out your wallet at the commissary. You see your clothes in a pile 
nearby. You squirm over towards one of your boots, hoping the Germans haven't found 
the knife inside. You tear off the cover of the hidden compartment with your teeth, 
and there it is!
^P
^c[White]Grasping the hilt of the knife in your mouth, you cut the ropes binding 
your wrists and ankles. You rifle through what remains of your stuff, hoping to find 
anything of value. Your money is gone, and so is the FN Model 1905 you had inside 
your jacket. Your street clothes were ripped off your body--the prison uniform will 
have to do. At least the boots are still intact.

You can move and have a weapon, but the odds are grim. Totenhaus is the most fortified 
building in Bavaria. No one has ever escaped alive. Will you be the first?
^P
^C[Gold]HOW TO PLAY

^c[White]Return to Totenhaus plays similarly to the original Wolfenstein 3-D. You 
start in the basement of Totenhaus, and must work your way through eight areas of 
the estate to reach the outer courtyard and escape.

You start with only a knife. You must kill a guard to acquire a pistol. More weapons 
can be found either stored throughout the chateau or carried by Nazi soldiers--but 
don't expect the Nazis to give them up easily!

^P
^C[Gold]HOW TO PLAY
^c[White] Weapons in Return to Totenhaus behave differently from those in the original 
Wolfenstein, and more like weapons in Doom or Operation Serpent. Your weapons do 
not lose power with distance, but instead the shots spread out. When firing a pistol 
or MP40 at long range, many of your shots will miss or hit enemies other than the 
target. Also unlike vanilla Wolfenstein, the game will not help you aim your weapon. 
You must point your weapon directly at your target or you will miss. Simply pointing 
in the general direction of a guard will not do.
^P
^G16 16 [DOOR4_1]
^C[Gold]KEYS AND LOCKS

^c[White]Unlike the original game, there are four keys to collect instead of two--gold, 
silver, bronze and iron. A typical locked door is shown to the left. The wreath on 
a locked door shows the color of the key needed to open it.

Sometimes you will see a plain brown locked door without a highlight color. These 
doors will open by themselves when you complete a level objective. Beware--they may 
release guards!
^P
^G16 16 [ETROOP]
^C[Gold]KNOW YOUR ENEMY
^C[White]Troopers are the majority of the German soldiers stationed in and around 
Totenhaus. Armed only with pistols, they mostly perform menial duties, low-security 
patrols, and other largely non-combat roles. However, they are still a serious threat, 
especially at close range!

Your first enemies will be troopers. Kill one and take his weapon!
^P
^G16 16 [EINFTRY]
^C[Gold]KNOW YOUR ENEMY
^C[White]Infantry are front-line combat personnel equipped with two-handed weapons 
for high-intensity combat. They are far more dangerous than their pistol-wielding 
counterparts. The submachine gun infantry are more effective at close range, while 
the riflemen, slow to aim, are more of a threat at a distance. When working together, 
they can cover each others' weaknesses and create lethal killzones.
^P
^G16 16 [EOFFICR]
^C[Gold]KNOW YOUR ENEMY
^C[White]Officers supervise and direct enlisted soldiers as well as filling managerial 
positions within Totenhaus. They are extremely fast both on their feet and on the 
draw and their agility more than makes up for their light armament.

Officers tend to prefer the ambush. Beware of officers lying in wait around corners 
and behind doors. When you hear him sound the alarm it is probably already too late.

^P
^G16 16 [EGUNR]
^C[Gold]KNOW YOUR ENEMY
^C[White]Machine gunners manned fixed MG42 machine guns and defend critical areas 
within and around Totenhaus. While they are not allowed to leave their posts, they 
can fire at over 1,000 rounds per minute, quickly shredding any intruder who enters 
their field of fire.

When facing machine gunners, use cover and stick to it. Trading blows is a game you 
will lose.
^P
^G16 16 [ESCHUTZ]
^C[Gold]KNOW YOUR ENEMY
^C[White]While the Army handles general security and day-to-day operations, the SS 
run Totenhaus and supervise the interrogation of prisoners. They come in the same 
varieties as Army soldiers, but their elite training makes them faster and more cunning 
adversaries.

SS wear body armor under their uniforms and take far more hits to kill than the regular 
goons. Watch your ammo.
^P
^G16 16 [EFALLS]
^C[Gold]KNOW YOUR ENEMY
^C[White]Totenhaus also serves as a training ground for crack Fallschirmjaeger paratroopers. 
Paratroopers are heavily armored and equipped with the devastating FG42 automatic 
rifle. Combining the virtues of the MP40 and the K98k, the FG42 is incredibly deadly 
at any range.

Paratroopers are the most dangerous enemies in Totenhaus. Good luck when facing a 
group of them--you'll need it!
^P
^G16 16 [WKNIFE]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]You start Return to Totenhaus with only a knife. The knife can be an effective 
weapon against a single guard, provided you can ambush him. Stabbing an isolated 
enemy filing through a doorway or around a corner can be an effective way to save 
ammo.

Otherwise, the proverb "don't bring a knife to a gunfight" applies. Don't charge 
into a room full of SS waving your knife around unless you want to become Schweizer 
Kase.
^P
^G16 16 [WPISTOL]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]The venerable Luger P08 pistol has been the favorite sidearm of the German 
Reich for almost forty years. It's not very much gun, but better than nothing. Its 
9mm rounds do moderate damage and it fires fast enough to deal with one or two enemies.


Against anything more, it has problems. It has neither the rate of fire needed for 
crowd control nor the accuracy needed for sniping. Once you get the MP40, the Luger 
will start to collect dust.
^P
^G16 16 [WMP40]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]In the field, the MP40 is a special issue weapon normally given only to 
squad leaders, but in the cramped confines of Totenhaus it is a versatile and widely 
issued all-rounder. Fast and reasonably accurate, the MP40 will make groups of enemies 
much more manageable.

Less manageable is the ammo consumption. Extended firing of the MP40 will inevitably 
drain you dry. The range isn't so great either.
^P
^G16 16 [WRIFLE]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]The Mauser K98k is the standard long arm of the German military. A German 
in 1943 goes into battle with much the same weapon his grandfather used. And make 
no mistake--it's a grandfather's rifle. Slow is the name of the game here.

On the other hand, its range and accuracy are unparalleled. Camp a doorway and duck 
in and out of cover, and with a steady hand you'll pick Nazis off like nobody's business.

^P
^G16 16 [WFG42]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]The FG42 is a bizarre hybrid of submachine gun and rifle built from a full-size 
MG34 machine gun. Firing 7.92 Mauser ammo at full automatic, the FG42 is an utterly 
devastating weapon with an excellent mix of damage and accuracy.

It has two caveats--first, the ammo consumption that is a problem with the MP40 is 
a much worse one with rifle ammo. Second, the F stands for Fallschirmjaeger. You 
think he's just going to let you take his gun?
^P
^G16 16 [WMG42]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]The pride of the Wehrmacht, the brand new MG42 machine gun is the last word 
in killing capacity. At 1,200 rounds per minute, it's less of a machine gun than 
it is a saw for cutting down people. Heer, SS, paratroopers--it matters not, they 
will just melt away before the power of the MG42.

However, the MG42 uses ammo up faster than any other weapon, ammo that is hard to 
come by. Use it sparingly.
^P
^G16 16 [WFLAMER]
^C[Gold]WEAPONS

^C[White]Bullets are nice, but sometimes you just want to douse Nazis in burning 
gasoline. The FmW 35 flamethrower provides. The flames of the FmW 35 are nearly as 
lethal as the MG42, but the ammo lasts much longer. If you've got a host of paratroopers 
breathing down your neck, the FmW is the weapon you want.

However, the flames travel much slower than bullets. You will have to consider whether 
your shots will make it before the Nazis open fire. Sometimes they won't.
^P
^G 16 16 [OSPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR

^C[Green]Operation Serpent ^c[White](2015) is my magnum opus, an 8-level true TC 
that is no more Wolfenstein 3-D than Corridor 7 or Planet Strike is. Set in a fictional 
Central American story in 1989, it has its own setting and aesthetic separate from 
Wolfenstein.

It has the largest levels ever built in the Wolfenstein engine, a bevy of advanced 
features, and a heavy metal soundtrack performed on real guitars!
^P
^G 16 16 [CBKPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR

^c[PURPLE]Coffee Break Episode 1: Castle Hasselhoff ^c[White](2014) returns to the 
visual style and atmosphere of the original Wolfenstein 3D while drastically expanding 
the gameplay and features. True to the mod's name, the levels here are generally 
short--but they're also my most devious yet! Only the Wolf gods will survive on Death 
Incarnate!
^P
^G16 16 [TDEMPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^c[White]The ^c[Brick]ECWolf Tech Demo ^c[White](2012) was developed to show the 
functionality of ECWolf 1.0 and recreates the storyline of Wolfenstein episode 1 
in 10 levels with a huge array of new objects, guards, and weapons.

The Tech Demo will also be the prologue episode in my upcoming project Eisenfaust 
Unleashed.
^P
^G 16 16 [WSPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR

^C[DarkBrown]Wolfenstein Sextilogy 3 ^c[White](2011) recreates the first three episodes 
of Wolfenstein for an older build of ECWolf, merging the original storyline and atmosphere 
with greatly enhanced graphics and features. 

Wolfenstein Sextilogy 3 incorporates updated versions of the maps from the earlier 
Wolfenstein Sextilogy 2 and Episode One Revisited mods. A hard drive crash ended 
development of episodes 4-6.
^P
^G 16 16 [SRPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR

^C[Blue]Spear Revisited ^c[White](2007) was my first serious test of the abilities 
of limitless source ports using the Wolf4GW engine. The 21 levels of this game are 
vastly more complex than any I had developed before, and still hold up well.

An ECWolf port was released in 2015, bringing high resolutions and full Windows Vista/7/8/10 
compatibility.
^P
^G 16 16 [E1RPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR

^C[DarkGray]Episode One Revisited ^c[White](2006) was originally intended to be a 
drop-in replacement for the original Episode 1 levels as I was tired of the TC-like 
direction of the first mods. My levels were however too complex for the original 
engine and I migrated to Wolf4GW.

These ten maps are available in Wolfenstein Sextilogy 3 but E1R can use the original 
game's graphics, accomodating players who want a more "classic" feel.
^P
^G 16 16 [TFAPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR

^C[Cyan]The Final Assault ^c[White](2004) was my second released mod for Wolfenstein, 
running on a slightly modified Project Totengraeber engine. It is noticeably cruder 
than my later works but was better than what I was making earlier.

The only released version of this was an 8-level demo. Development ceased in late 
2004 due to lack of interest.
^P
^G 16 16 [TRTDPIC]
^C[Gold]ALSO FROM EXECUTOR
^C[Red]The Road to Despair ^c[White](2003) was my first released mod, after a long 
and tortuous development starting in December 2000 (the first map was written on 
Christmas Day). I learned the fundamentals of modding in this project, and it shows.


Levels are sloppy, graphics are mismatched, and the quality is generally substandard. 
Everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. You should have seen the crap I made in 
'99...
^P
^C[Gold]COMING SOON

^C[Yellow]Eisenfaust Unleashed
^c[White]Finishing the story started in the ECWolf Tech Demo, Eisenfaust Unleashed 
pits you against Dr. Schabbs and his mutant army. 24 levels filled with never-before-seen 
terrors await you. Fight new and deadly mutants and four devastating bosses.
^C[Purple]Coffee Break Episode X
^c[White]In which I team up with the infamous Doom legend Xaser for a bigger, bolder, 
badder take on Coffee Break. Be afraid.
^P
^C[Gold]COMING NOT SO SOON

^C[Black]Astrostein Trilogy
^C[White]Laz Rojas' classic reimagined from the ground up with entirely new maps 
and gameplay. Having brought back advanced technology from the future through an 
ancient time portal, the Nazis have won World War II and conquered Earth--and beyond. 
The year is 2043, and B.J. Blazkowicz, just emerged from stasis aboard a Nazi prison 
vessel, is all that stands between the Nazis and galactic domination.
^P
^C[Gold]POSTSCRIPT
^c[White]I hope you enjoy playing Return to Totenhaus. If you do, I would also recommend 
playing Laz Rojas' original Escape Totenahus in either its PC or Mac incarnations. 
And who knows, I might even make an ECWolf Classics port of it one day...
