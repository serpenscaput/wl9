^C7c 2nd of January 1935 
 
^C00  ...Running for your life chased through the 
frosty forest by the SS and Dogs,
last mag of an mp40 and a knife... 
and your Mars Ring.
This may be the end of your life...
What a terrible holiday season it has been
since being ripped out of bed 
& arrested by the Gestapo on Xmas Eve.....
Escape if you can, your brothers in the order will hide you...
