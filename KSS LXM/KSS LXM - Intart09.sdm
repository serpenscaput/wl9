^C00 Level 9 : 'Escape or Die Here'
^C00 Location : Central Area of Hotel Floor 2

^C08 Through the elevator you hear the sound of trucks & footsteps of response unit squads :
^C8b "That could be him in the elevator"  
^C06 "Kill Him!" 
^C7c "His blood will atone for this assault" 

^C08 They must've sent a small army. It is Now Or Never, I must escape before more reinforcements arrive or I will die here, I can flee in one of those trucks...
