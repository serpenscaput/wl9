^C00 Level 8 : 'Castle Hallway'
^C00 Location : 
3rd Floor of Building / Part of Old Castle 
 
^C08 From what has been overheard and from documents in the officers desks, it seems that above the floors converted into a Hotel the Castle remained as such. 

No voices can be heard.
Maybe there is a way to escape from here.....
