My greetings and salutations to Wolfenstein 3-D/Spear of Destiny fans everywhere!



“Operation Lone Eagle” is my thid Wolf3D project and the longest one I’ve created 
thus far. Some may remember that I completed both “Infiltration” and “Behind Enemy 
Lines” in 2002 (although the second one was not released until sometime in July 2007. 
If you enjoy playing this project, then I recommend you try them. Both can be found 
at The Wolfenstein 3-D Dome (www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk).

I couldn’t think of a backstory to this project so I just left that part alone and 
focused solely on the creation aspects. I was never familiar with C++ and coding 
of the source code (or had time for it anyway), so I made some unique environments 
using various neat optical illusions.


LEVELS:


1.	ROAD TO CAEN
2.	THE MANOR
3.	CATACOMBS
4.	FACILITY
5.	EQUALIBRIUM
6.	PORTRAIT OF DEATH
7.	HEDGEROWS
8.	TOWN STROLL 
9.	NEW WARDEN
10.	PSYCHO WARD

TIP: Save often!


CREDITS:

I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Majik Monkee (winwolf (at) fastmail.us) 
 for creating the enemy and weapon sprites which I’ve used in this project. Without 
Monkee’s Image World (www.mmimageworld.dugtrio17.com), many of the community’s excellent 
sprites and other custom graphics would go unused and unnoticed!

TOOLS USED:

-ChaosEdit V1.25 preRelease
-Paint Shop Pro 7.04
-Sound Recorder
-IMF Tools


Project start date: July 2007
Project completion: September 4th, 2007
