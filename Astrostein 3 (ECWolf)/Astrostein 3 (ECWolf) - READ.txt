Original Version by Laz Rojas
Fix by Sam Feichter (AstroCreep) 	
12/09/2018


DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL

Menu graphics adapted from WolfenDOOM Version of Astrostein, Wolf 3D, and the ECWolf Tech Demo by Executor.
Includes fonts from Tech Demo by Executor
includes imf macwolf songs by Andy_Nonymous
Reverted to original Astrostein weapons, due to lack of ripped sprites.


This is only a temporary build, as this is designed for the crippled version currently
being run by the dev versions of ECWolf.  As such, this WILL NOT WORK with the official releases yet, only the dev versions
which support MacWolf.  Dev versions can be found at http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/ecwolf/

This also includes a modified Astrostein 2 mod needed to run this fix, already
MacBinary'd up.

TO RUN:
Extract ZIP file
Drag and drop "Astro3_Data.bin" and "astrostein3_fix_PC.pk3" onto the ecwolf executable

OR

run "ecwolf --file Astro3_Data.bin astrostein3_fix_PC.pk3"
