WELCOME TO WOLFENSTEIN: UMBRELLA BEGINNINGS
    EPISODE 2: OPERATION: END EPIDEMIC!
============================================
For those of you who have played Episode 1: Discovery, welcome back! The goal in 
creating Episode 2: Operation: End Epidemic was to continue the story of WUB and 
to go above and beyond the first game in terms of creativity and new features. I 
can proudly say O:EE has become a much bigger and better game than the first! Along 
with all the original coding features of the first game, Episode 2 adds many more 
new features-some never before seen this way. My hope is that those who enjoyed Episode 
1 will feel even more strongly about Episode 2. Alot of hard work and time has gone 
into it. Enjoy!

======================
EPISODE 2 NEW FEATURES
======================
All of the features you remember from Episode 1 return for Episode 2, including: 
Logfiles, the poison system and silenced pistol just to name a few. New features 
exclusive to Operation: End Epidemic include:

Umbrella Collectible Symbols-Collect all 30 for a special surprise!

Rare Treasures-Apart from the standard treasure you will find, Episode 2 introduces 
Rare Treasures. There is one to find per level. Collect all 10 for a special Award.


Uniform/Disguises-Blend in! Equip a guard uniform and fool your enemies into thinking 
you are one of them!

Awards-Episode 2 introduces the Award system. Collect a certain number of items or 
fullfill other requirements to unlock these special Awards. Each unlocked Award gives 
you something special!

Movable Objects-Now, not only can certain wall tiles move to reveal hidden areas, 
but special objects can be moved too! You can even solve puzzles by using movable 
objects.

These are but a few of the many new features found in Operation: End Epidemic!

============
KNOWN ISSUES
============
A lot of hard work has been put into the creation of Operation: End Epidemic to insure 
it is as bug free as possible. However, some minor known issues are present:

-Very occasionally the music and sound effects will warp/garble. Simply save your 
current game and then close down the game. Restart a fresh game, reload your saved 
game and the sound will return to normal. This issue occurs while using DosBox.

-Sometimes one of the Moving Armor pieces disappears in the "Checkmate" puzzle. Consider 
yourself lucky if this happens.

-Occasionally some of the patrolling guards on Floor 8 walk in some weird patterns. 
They are notorious for drinking too much ale.

============
TIPS & HINTS
============
-Like the first game, Operation: End Epidemic can be played either at a slow, careful/stealthy 
pace, or a rapid, guns blazing pace. There are some areas that require both however. 
Don't forget your pistol is silenced. Use it to your advantage!

-The Logfiles are easier to find this time. They are important! Not only do they 
tell the story, but they also give you clues as how to solve certain puzzles and 
find rare hidden items.

-When you come across a disguise use it! Blend in! You can use a disguise to your 
advantage by scouting ahead and also entering areas that would be too dangerous for 
BJ on his own. NOTE-Disguises no longer work once you fire your weapon. Also, disguises 
will not work if there are any guards still alive that were alerted to your presence. 
Kill any alerted guards first, then put on the disguise!

-Operation: End Epidemic has many puzzles to solve. Take your time. Read the Logfile 
on the level the puzzle appears. Many times there are clues in the Logfile on how 
to solve the puzzle.

-Low on ammo or health? Explore the level you are on and look for secret passages. 
There are many secret passages and even secret passages within secret passages! Every 
level can be completed on the hardest difficulty starting with only the pistol and 
a few bullets.

-Play Operation: End Epidemic on the hardest difficulty. It may be a challenge for 
some players, but the game translates the best if played this way.
