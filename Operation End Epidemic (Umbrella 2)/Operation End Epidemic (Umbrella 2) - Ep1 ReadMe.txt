WELCOME TO WOLFENSTEIN: UMBRELLA BEGINNINGS!
============================================
WUB fuses the worlds of Wolfenstein 3D with Resident Evil. I have
tried to keep a careful balance with the two. While the game 
engine is Wolf3d, much of the story (told through Logfiles) has to
deal with the universe of Resident Evil. I have created my own 
story based on the original events of the Resident Evil series and
Wolf3d series. My hope is that fans of these two series enjoy my
fresh spin on these two great franchises!

============
WUB FEATURES
============
One of the most prominent features of WUB is the Logfile system. 
Every level contains a Logfile. To read the file, stand over it and
press the "use" key. The story in WUB is told through the Logfiles.
Some Logfiles are out in the open while others are harder to find.
Finding the Logfiles not only expands the story for the player but
many times gives clues to treasure, keys, and other collectible
objects.

There is also a Poison system in WUB. Throughout some levels you 
will encounter Biohazard toxic spills that will poison you if you
come in contact with them. The poison is time based and will 
eventually kill you. The only cure for poison is to find a blue
herb. *Note* Blue herbs are only collectible if you are poisoned.

In WUB your primary weapon is a silenced pistol. The silenced gun
changes gameplay dramatically, often times allowing the player to
"sneak" around in many levels. If your style is stealth play, the
silenced pistol is for you. *Note* The survival knife is also a
silenced weapon in WUB.

==========================

============
KNOWN ISSUES
============
Hard time has been spent to assure WUB is as bug free as possible.
However, some known issues are present:

-There appears to be a minor difference when playing WUB on DosBox
vs. VDMsound. When played through VDMsound, some pushwalls will not
move the appropriate distance. There are only a few minor areas in
WUB where exact pushwall count is needed. 

-Fake Hitler fireballs move very slow in VDMsound. And yes, I am 
fully aware that they move VERY fast when playing through DosBox.
But, they ARE fireballs and they SHOULD move fast!

-If at all possible, play WUB through DosBox. It is the most 
definitive way to experience it.

============
TIPS & HINTS
============
-WUB can be played either at a slow, careful/stealthy pace-or-a 
rapid, guns blazing pace. However, there are some areas that
call for a combination of the two.

-Don't forget your pistol is silenced! Use it to your advantage!

-WUB contains many secret passages. And there are many secret
passages contained WITHIN other secret passages. Some of WUB's
most interesting areas are hidden.

-Find the Logfiles. Not only do the Logfiles explain the story,
many often give clues as to where hidden keys and other important
items are.

-Play WUB on the hardest difficulty level. It may be a challenge for
some players, but the game translates the best if played this way.
