You are hiding in a secret nazi stronghold. You find a key in front of you.
You find out that it's the only way to escape from Hitler and most of his men.
As you open the door you see several prison cells. Later on you'll see unfortunate 
jewish soldiers that were hung by the nazis.
Your quest is to obtain information about the nazis and take the spear away from 
Satan. Satan already took possession of the spear. You must stop him before he wipes 
out the entire world.
Here's a warning, be extremely cauticious when you enter a room. Make sure that you 
look for secret passages, because some secret passages can be the way out of the 
stage.
Good luck to you.

I give specialthanks to the people that created WolfenStein. 
Thanks to them I can make my own levels. I wish them good luck in making other computer 
games. 
Well, this has been a great opportunity for my brother and I. If you like my levels 
please contact me and I will be creating more levels for you. It might take a while 
though.


      Sincerely,
      Melissa O'Brien
