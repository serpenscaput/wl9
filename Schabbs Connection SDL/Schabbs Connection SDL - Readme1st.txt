                         "The Schabbs Connection"



     After destroying the Evil Fat face, you have returned to Istanbul to
investigate a series of grisly murders..People have started turning up
 dead in the streets, with horrible burns and terrible skin mutalations.
There could be only 1 explanation: Fat Face had given the research on the toxic waste 
to 
someone before you killed him and retrieved the case..you nose around and in a little,

stinky, dark and nasty tavern you find out that there have been reports of activity

around the old monastary that everyone thought was long abandoned outside of town.

   Not just activity, but talk of corpses running around killing animals and people 
in the night!
Bodies turning up with missing limbs......legs, arms etc..that would explain the 
radiation
 burns on the bodies also...but that means only 1 thing,  Schabbs!  It couldn't be! 
he's dead.
Or is he?
