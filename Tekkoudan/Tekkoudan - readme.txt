Details:
---------
Please take notice, this is the ALPHA release!  It is only version 0.3!!!
This is no where close to a finished product!  With that in mind have fun
playing the game and send any bug reports or comments/suggestions to
dla_one@yahoo.com.  Later I'll have a forum on the Tekkoudan website where
you can report bugs.


Tools I used:
--------------
Borland Turbo C++ 3.0
Borland C++ 3.1
JASC Paint Shop Pro 5.1
FloEdit by Florian Stohr
Mapedit 8.4 by David Huntoon, Bryan Baker, Warren Buss(because the FloEdit
map editer sucks)



Props to:
-----------
-id software  - for making Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, Quake2 and Quake3.
 And they released the source code for all these games!  They're such nice
 guys!
