^C[Red]										OPERATION: WASSERSTEIN
^c00
Schabbs is dead. His macabre project, Operation Eisenfaust, is in ruins. 

Four days ago, Allied reconnaissance planes over Austria intercepted a strange message. It appeared to be addressed to Reichsmarschall A.H. Wasser, the most fearsome and elusive commander of the Wehrmacht. A man devoid of moral scruples, with an insatiable lust for power, Wasser has long been suspected of masterminding the most nefarious and secretive projects of the Reich.

^P

The message, terse and with no context, simply read: 

Attn: A.H.W. 
Operation: Wasserstein completion. 
Ubermensche review requested.
Schwangau.
Please advise.
H.V.R. 
^P
Allied intelligence, already anxious about rumoured attempts to salvage Eisenfaust, successfully trace the origin of the message to the mysterious Castle Schwangau, high in the Bavarian Alps.

BJ, it will be up to you to infiltrate through the undercroft of the castle, ascertain what Operation Wasserstein and its shadowy Ubermensche might be, and put an end to the machinations of Reichsmarschall Wasser.

Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after,
And the poetry he invented was easy to understand;
He knew human folly like the back of his hand,
And was greatly interested in armies and fleets;
When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,
And when he cried, people died in the streets.
^C[Red]-W.H. Auden

^C[Green]										ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
^c00

It has been twenty years since I first conceived this project, so its release is long overdue. I have attempted to maintain the original atmosphere and gameplay of Wolfenstein, as seen through my 1990s childhood imagination. Given the level of detail I have incorporated, the game is best played at higher resolutions. 

I suggest the `Recommended` skill level. For a major challenge, choose `Extreme!`.

I wish to thank BJ Rowan, Gary Ragland, and Dave Blazkowicz, beta testers for the original Wasserstein mod way back in 1999.

I also wish to thank all those whose artistic work influenced or contributed to this mod. I sincerely hope you enjoy my small offering to the Wolfenstein community.
