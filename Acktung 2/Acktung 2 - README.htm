<p><font face="Georgia">Here we go again...</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">I have been working on this map replacement set ever
since the release of the original <i>acktung!</i> six years ago.&nbsp; Not that
it has taken me that long to build and test the maps, but other projects (like <i>HoS</i>/<i>Orb</i>,

etc.) had taken priority at the time.&nbsp; The original set was designed to be
fun and to not take itself too seriously, much how I view the maps in the
commercial game.&nbsp; <i>The Last Waltz</i> is much more polished, but I think
it is still a fun play.&nbsp; Only time will tell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">Why call it <i>The Last Waltz</i>?&nbsp; I think I can
safely say that I will never do another 60-level map replacement set.&nbsp; Too
draining and definitely too time consuming.&nbsp; I don't even want to estimate
the time it took to design and play test these levels.&nbsp; It was a labour of
love though as I am still as passionate for this game as I was back in the early

90's.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">I will admit to getting lazy in one area.&nbsp; I have
ignored changing the par times.&nbsp; My bad.&nbsp; I don't have a hex editor or

Borland installed on this PC and I didn't feel like going through all of the
trouble of installing anything.&nbsp; If this is an issue then you have my
humblest of apologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia">I guess the only other issue is why I didn't jump on the

SDL bandwagon.&nbsp; Truth be told, I haven't played a single SDL mod past the
first level.&nbsp; Since I cannot configure the movement keys to my liking (I
use the keypad), I can't be bothered to re-train myself to use different keys to

play.&nbsp; I am one old dog that isn't willing to learn any new tricks.</font></p>
