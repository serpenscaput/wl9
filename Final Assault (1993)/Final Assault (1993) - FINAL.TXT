                             The Final Assault


            In this episode, a nazi spy has informed the Allies that 
         
         the Third Reich is on the move again, but is being lead by   
         
         a mysterious leader.  And their plans are to round up all 
         
         their most deadly weapons and unleash them on the Allied
         
         nations.  He also said that the weapons were being stored on
         
         various levels of castle Lagerhause (storage house), and were
         
         being taken down to the bottom level by a huge elevator.

            It is your job to go into castle Lagerhause and take out 
         
         these weapons before the worst happens to the good old 
         
         U.S. of A.  This is the last chance that those nazi pigs have
         
         of starting another world war; but B.J. is back in business.
