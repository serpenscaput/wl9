^C20ACT FOUR - CONFRONTATION

	^C00You've somehow made it through the complex surrounding ^C80Hitler's ^C00private 
bunker and now you're in the main annex that leads to his lair.

	^C80Hitler ^C00has spared no expense in making sure that his lair is guarded by 
the finest of his loyal servants. You'll have to go through them all before you can 
take a shot at the Fuhrer himself.

	Good luck, B.J.!
