Hello there! Thank you for trying out my 3-level mod. 
Not many changes were made aside from the 3 maps that I created.

These levels were made just for fun. I'm not a hardcore mapper (although I do find 
them fun to make) at all, nor do I have any experience in coding.

*All maps were created by the use of ChoasEdit.


Thanks,
