^C[Red]ABOUT ^C[Green]ASTROCREEP

^C00I've been making mods for Wolfenstein 3D off and on
since around 1996.  After a long hiatus, I discovered
ECWolf, and have been making mods for it ever since.

^C00Aside from modding Wolf, I also enjoy making music and
editing/creating images in Photoshop.  My GFX work is
mostly done in these games, but you can check out my music
at soundcloud.com/aquafiend.
