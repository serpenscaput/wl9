-=+=- SWIFT MANEUVERS -=+=-

Hello player/reader! Thank you for downloading and playing Swift Maneuvers: the demo! This mod is named such because, like my previous mod,
it is a micro mod - only spanning two small levels made in the spirit of Tricob's Operation: Kill BJ.
I originally intended for this mod to have 3 levels, but since the deadline (March 24) was fast approaching
and I had little time to work on the mod, I had to leave it at 2 levels.
To make up for this, I plan on making 2 floor for each episode to make a total of 12 episodes in the full release.
Regardless, please enjoy and keep your eyes peeled for the future episodes!
I am happy to be able to release this mod on my birthday.

= CREDITS =
Graphics:
Chiseled = Chaingun sprites
The Josh = Trench Warfare
WSJ = Scientist and SS officer sprites

Audio:

=> New Pork Bossa midi from Mother 3 arranged by Astrocreep
=> Tricob for his tracks

and you for playing my mod!

NOTES:
- All other maps have been erased. Only the first 2 are available and accessible from the first episode.
- There are not coding changes, so this is playable in DOS, SDL, & EC/LZWolf
- There is one notable bug, in which the gray wall will appear in places where it should not. To remedy this, try restarting thw whole game.
