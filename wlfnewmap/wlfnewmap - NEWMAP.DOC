This is a sample floor map of what can be accomplished with Wolfenstein Map 
Editor.  Change the original or create your own from scratch.  Make the floor
harder by adding more guards, make the floor easier by adding more ammunition
and bigger guns.  Add secret passages to the original maps.  Its your choice.

To use this new floor map, replace the original map files MAPHEAD.WL1 and
MAPTEMP.WL1 with the files included.  Either copy the old files to another
directory or rename them.  These new floors were designed for a challenge,
so it is recommended to play at the hardest skill level to get the full effect.
NOTE: These files are for version 1.0.

The Wolfenstein Map Editor is very user friendly.  You can change the walls,
floors, guards, dogs, guns, ammunition, treasure, tables, beds, etc.
Everything on the floor map can be changed.  The program is menu-driven with
functions like copy block, fill block, and print floor to file.  Copy rooms
from one level to another.  You will not be disappointed with the quality and
features of the editor.

The editor can edit version 1.0 and I am working on version 1.4.
