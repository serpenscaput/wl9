Misc. Author Info       : Wolfenstein level designer since 1999. At this point I've
			  probably written at least 200 maps.

Description             : A single map for ECWolf-compatible source ports built around
			  the idea of forcing the player to move quickly and with purpose
			  to escape the hordes of Nazis. The title means "compulsion to
			  move" in German and refers to a situation in chess where every
			  possible legal move will expose one to more danger.
