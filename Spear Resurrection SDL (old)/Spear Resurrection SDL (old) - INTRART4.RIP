^C00 The "Grau Adler" was Hitler's most trusted covert agent. He now occupies the role of Baron von Schmitt's number one henchman. This hulking man doesn't know the meaning of the word "defeat", unless it applies to yours.

Seeing as you're about to invade his grand offices, you'd better have that MCS Mk4 ready, B.J.! You do have one, don't you?!!!
