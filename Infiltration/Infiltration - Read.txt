This is Projekt: Vertilgung... but not as you know it!
======================================================

Introducing, Project: Infiltrate! This was my first attempt at editing Wolfenstein. 
It is very crude and poorly constructed. You'll probably notice the basic structures 
of the levels are similar to the final version's levels. Even the title is more generic 
and well... boring. Still you may find this interesting to see what my childish, 
13 year old, brain could concoct. The levels (3 of them) are similar to the Projekt 
Vertilgung demo I released in 2001. Don't expect quality of PV though. In hindsight 
the levels, graphics and everything... suck. Still some of you may find this nostalgic 
in a sense.


Enjoy,
Zach Higgins
