BJ Blazcowicz was about to embark on his mission to backup Henry Irons when an excited 
corporal ran towards his Jeep, waving both of his hands in the air to attract attention.


Corporal: "Sir, the colonel has received a communiqué from Lieutenant-Commander Irons. 
He's secured the third castle, and has advanced to the fourth area. You've been asked 
to remain here for further briefing".

BJ: "I'm not surprised. I still don't think I'm needed here."

BJ and the corporal returned to the colonel's office to review the latest intelligence.


Colonel: "Here's Irons' latest report, Blazcowicz. It appears we may have been premature 
in declaring him MIA."

BJ: "I agree, colonel. You may have been premature."

The colonel's face flushed at the remark, but he resumed composure and said "We're 
going to hold you back for a couple more days. Irons still has a long way to go, 
and others of his kind have failed to last the distance. He may still need your help".


BJ: "There are no others of his kind, colonel. Not anymore. Give him a few more days, 
and I'm sure we'll hear from him again. If there's nothing further, I'd like to check 
out the local scenery. I haven't spent much time in this part of Germany, postwar. 
I'll check back with you in a few days. If you hear from Irons in the meantime, let 
me know immediately.".

With that, BJ turned his back to the colonel, tossed his mess kit to the corner of 
the room, and strode through the door, a copy of Irons' report clutched tightly in 
his left hand as his footfalls echoed down the hallway.
