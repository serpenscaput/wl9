This is the dropped project "Wolfram". I release the MAP-DATA and OBJ-DATA with a 
great big vswap
and many good changes. The coding was made by Dean Horton.

- MLI Removed
- 300 Ammo
- One-Up gives 200+ and a 1000 points
- Many changed graphics and sounds
- 20 seamless levels and three secret. I forgot which 3 levels they're accessed from. 
:-)
- More sprites added.
