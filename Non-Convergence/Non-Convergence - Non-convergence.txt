"Tricob's Non-convergence 1-level demo"

Hello again from Tricob.  This is a one-level demo of a new map I made.  To challenge 
myself as a map designer, I decided to go beyond my comfort zone and create a map 
that took the difficult way towards design ... every step of the way.  This map was 
supposed to be nothing more than an experiment, and I didn't even expect it to be 
any good.  But when it was done, it had come out a lot better than I expected it 
to.

This map is called "Non-convergence" for a reason - for over half of the level, the 
left wall has a different texture than the right one, and the player never sees those 
two textures join together.

This new level uses the Base Of Operations source, and many of the features you saw 
in the one-level demo also appear here, including the "keys on shelves".  But there 
are no floor/ceiling textures this time around.

Of all the maps I've ever done, this one is my personal favorite.  Oddly enough, 
it falls well below the original Wolf3D requirements;  there's less than 350 Static 
Objects, less than 100 Actors, and less than 20 doors!  I still don't see how that 
happened.

Anyway, enjoy the map, but be forewarned - once you play through this level, you'll 
never look at my maps the same ever again.

Ubuntu users:  I could not get "Code Blocks" to work, so I've included a Ubuntu shortcut 
that'll run the game in the WINE emulator.

Enjoy the demo.  :-)
