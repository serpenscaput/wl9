               "Escape From the House of Style"

     Yup, here it is.  The one you've all been waiting for.
Escape if you can (and only if you want to)!  Installation is
really quite simple.  Simply copy the file VSWAP.WL1 to the
you Wolfenstein Directory and start playing.  You may want to
backup up your old VSWAP.WL1 before installing the new one,
as it will be erased.
     I don't ask for any money, or even recognition, but if
you feel the absolute need to spend some money call up the
Twilight Zone BBS at (715)652-2758 or (715)652-2700 and
donate some money there.

TROUBLE SHOOTING:

Well, what can I say... nobody is perfect.  It worked for me
(Wolfenstein v 1.4), so I guess your just gonna have to call
a Microsoft Certified (or is it Certifiable) Technician or
something.  And if you still can't figure it out, QUIT USING
WINDOWS AND LEARN SOME DOS!!!

      Live long and Prosper!  May the Force be with You!
