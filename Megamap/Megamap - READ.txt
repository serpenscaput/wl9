ECWolf Vanilla-Style Resource Pack (lite)
by Astrocreep 3/15/19

NOTE
This version lacks decorate actors, it only has the stuff from Spear of Destiny
in it.  

This is a simple editing resource pack, designed to get anyone
up and going making vanilla-styled levels for ECWolf with 
extended features such as elevators, switches, and other stuff.

NOTE:  To enable plane depth, zheights, and brightness levels, you need
to uncomment the lines that you want to use in the XLAT file,
until then those features are disabled.  I did not define flats,
since this is a "vanilla-themed" resource pack.

This includes a .WMC file for WDC with extra tiles already
programmed, a few variants of the bosses that drop keys 
instead of ending the game, and a couple weapons borrowed
from Coffee Break, plus a few SOD actors

TO USE

create a new project in WDC, set MAXPLANES to 4 (if you want
to use switches and other info plane stuff) and load ec_wl6.wmc
as the map definition file.

I highly recommend you read the XLAT tutorials included as well.
