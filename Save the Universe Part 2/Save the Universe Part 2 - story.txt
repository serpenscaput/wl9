It is the year 2149. The universe has been completely colonised by the human race 
with the help of technology stolen
from different alien races (aliens have stolen human technology as well, such as 
the aircraft carrier, Bazooka rocket system,
the computer mouse and biro pens).

"The government of the Human's Universe has not paid taxes in over 60 Zogulons (14.31 
years). We have to decide a course to
take to punish the Human Universe." Spoke the President of the Spalaxy (all the universes 
combined) Council.
Delegates of each universe glared at Human delegate. The Delegate of the Human Universe 
shifted uneasily in his seat.
"It is therefore decided that the Human Universe is to destroyed. Delegate of the 
Goop Universe: it is your task to blow up
the Human Universe." Spoke the great President of the Spalaxy Council.

The leader of the Goop and Delegate of the Goop Universe, the Ganalech, paced around 
the control room of the world wrecking
weapon known only as the RBG14 (Really Big Gun Version 1.4). It was also known as 
the Scriptnobeam. And the FazerLaser. And
the BlasterCaster.
 "Is this going to take long?" Demanded the Ganalech. A small shrimpy alien looking 
different to the Goop aliens approached.
These small aliens were specially chosen because you can't have an evil alien empire 
without sterotypical shrimpy aliens
informing the Evil Alien Leader of the progress of his super weapon.
 "Er... Yesir. Zee gun vill point at the Hyoomen Universe in venty vor hours." Shrieked 
the little alien. The aliens always
initiate their superweapons or give deadlines for hostage handovers and ransoms 24 
hours. They have seen too many movies.

Unknown to the Goop aliens the Humans were sending in their best soldier blah blah 
blah blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda
to blah blah blah. You get the picture.
