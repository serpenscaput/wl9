Greetings from Tricob.  This is the newest official version of the Base Of Operations demo.

The High Scores table has a new set of high scores on it.  If you want to beat these scores, you have to get 100% on *everything* on Death Incarnate!

Saved games from older versions of this demo will *not* work here!  I've included a number of bugfixes in this release -

* The walls and the floor/ceiling tiles were updated one frame apart from each other.  This is now fixed.  (WL_DRAW.CPP)
* Dogs no longer bleed when very slightly injured (WL_STATE.CPP)

I do apologize for the bugs that plagued this code in the past.  :-(

The level in this demo has been updated.  New secrets are included, and one hidden area is somewhat easier on the top difficulty.

"Failing" ceiling lights have been updated, so now their flickering appears to be more random than before.

Note also that Self-running Demos are now running more smoothly, and are now allowed to run longer.  The EXE uses external demo files now.

I also updated the statusbar image, the Credits screen, and I *finally* fixed the texture in the Sign-on screen!

Ubuntu users:  I could not get "Code Blocks" to work, so I've included a Ubuntu shortcut that'll run the game in the WINE emulator.

Enjoy the demo.  :-)

- Tricob.
