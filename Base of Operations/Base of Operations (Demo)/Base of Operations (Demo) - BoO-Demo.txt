Greetings from Tricob.  This is the newest official version of the Base Of Operations 
demo.

The High Scores table has a new set of high scores on it.  If you want to beat these 
scores, you have to get 100% on *everything* on Death Incarnate!

Saved games from versions older than 1.2 of this demo will *not* work here!  I've 
included a number of bugfixes in this release -

* Fixed a bug in the routine that replaced "unused" sprites with "used" ones;  the 
routines were spawning a new object instead of just replacing it.
* In v1.2 of the demo level, a northwest Pushwall made a vine abruptly appear when 
the wall was pushed.  Fixed!

I do apologize for the bugs that plagued this code in the past.  :-(

Ubuntu users:  I could not get "Code Blocks" to work, so I've included a Ubuntu shortcut 
that'll run the game in the WINE emulator.

Enjoy the demo.  :-)

- Tricob.
