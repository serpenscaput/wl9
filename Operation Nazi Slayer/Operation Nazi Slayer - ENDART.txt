^C[DarkRed]THE BATTLE IS OVER... ^C00

The experiments ended. Mutant Hiedler has been defeated. The laboratory burned down. 
BJ escaped and retrieved the Sceptre of Destruction.

Is it all over though?

Over or not, BJ takes a vacation that he really deserved. The world surely owes him 
some beer now.

... but the wolves don't sleep. The end?

^C[DarkRed]CONGRATULATIONS! ^C00

Thank you for playing my mod! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did making it.

Also if you want to check out more mods from me, give "Wolfenstein 3D - Fourth Encounter" 
a try.

And again, check out the "ONS-credits.txt" file for the credits. I've got some help 
from some really nice people. :)
