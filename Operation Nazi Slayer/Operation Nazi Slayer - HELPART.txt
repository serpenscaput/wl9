^C[DarkRed]STORY ^C00

^C[Brown]"You served the country well, Blazkowicz. Unfortunately you are our only 
reliable men so we have to send you on this next mission. Have you ever heard about 
the 'Sceptre of Destruction'?" ^C00

^C[Green]"Sir! I haven't heard about it, sir!" ^C00

^C[Brown]"Me neither... Anyway the nazis have stolen it and apparently we have to 
take it back or we will all die. ^C00
^P
^G 8 8 [STORY]

^C[Brown]They hid it somewhere in a secret laboratory complex around Fritzberg. We 
have heard that nazi scientists are making some sort of clones there. If that's true 
then maybe they are using this artifact for their sick experiments and that needs 
to be stopped at all costs or we won't stand a chance against these freaks." ^C00

him at the end of the 1st area. He will use 2 SMGs against you. He is slow and not 
much of a threat...
he is just a Trans Grosse replacement after all.

^C[DarkRed]THE REGULAR BAD GUYS ^C00

^C[DarkRed]7) Scientist ^C00- They are the workers of the laboratories but that doesn't 
mean they're not trained to hunt down intruders. (They drop a clip from Type A)
^C[DarkRed]8) Clone ^C00- These are silent assholes. Just like the mutants. They 
could hide behind corners and nobody would notice them. (They drop a clip from Type

what you get for not getting all the secrets!
