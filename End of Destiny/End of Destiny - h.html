With the war over for almost a year, a group of fanatical nazis headed by the imposing

Baron von Schmitt had established a base of operations in an old castle
located in the Spanish countryside. Having recaptured the Spear of Destiny from
a British military storage facility, they'd hoped to use the artefact to resurrect

Adolf Hitler and a number of other prominent nazis killed during the war,
and, in doing so, bring about a rebirth of the Third Reich itself.<BR>
<BR>
All
had been going according to plan until the intervention of one B.J. Blazkowicz.
After a gruelling battle, B.J. had managed to take on one and all to regain
possession of the Spear, and after succeeding, had thrown the thing into the depths

of the ocean off the Spanish coast to ensure it could never be found and
fall into the wrong hands again.<BR>
<BR>
But B.J. Blazkowicz had not been as
thorough as he'd thought! Baron von Schmitt, though defeated in combat by Blazkowicz,

had outsmarted the Allied one man army. He'd been cunning enough to have
a small tracking device inserted into the shaft of the Spear. And the backup
plan he had in place should things not go as originally planned was in motion.<BR>

<BR>
The
battle for the End of Destiny would soon begin...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxFF0000b>Late March 1946:</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> 
A tall dark figure, silhouetted by the setting sun, stood looking over the remains

of the once imposing Spanish castle. The flames had died down, but thick smoke
still belched forth from the crumbling ruins that, until just the day before,
had been host to Baron von Schmitt and his loyal followers. Intent on using the
"Spear of Destiny" to resurrect Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, their dream
had been shattered by none other than their Allied nemesis, B. J. Blazkowicz.<BR>

<BR>
The
lone figure stepped forward and moved slowly amongst the broken
stone formations that once formed the foundations of the western side of the castle.

As he turned around, closely examining the destruction before him, the sunlight
brushed across his face momentarily. It was the face of Heinrich Haufmann.
He'd hoped it would never come to this, but things had not gone as planned,
and his time to take action had arrived.<BR>
<BR>
His visit to the site was
to ensure there was no obvious evidence of the activities that had taken place
here. Normally, local authorities would have been swarming over the site investigating

the cause of the blaze. But a little stolen nazi gold directed at a few
corrupt officials did wonders for keeping the authorities away for a day or so.<BR>

<BR>
As
he explored further into the ruins, Herr Haufmann encountered smouldering
corpses littered among the charred ruins. Obviously, he would have to
dig a little deeper into the reserves of nazi wealth than he'd anticipated to
have all this covered up. Thankfully, there would still be enough wealth left
in reserve to fund the new operation. Turning to leave, he stopped momentarily.
He'd heard something! A groan?<BR>
<BR>
Turning toward where the sound had originated,
he saw an arm reaching out from a nearby pile of rubble! A survivor!
Running over to help the unfortunate soul, he quickly cleared the debris from
around the face of the person. The smell of charred flesh almost made him recoil!

So badly burnt was the face that he could hardly recognise it. But, it was somehow

vaguely familiar. Only when the person spoke did Herr Haufmann realise just
who it was...<BR>
<BR>
The voice was that of Baron von Schmitt!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n>"Herr Baron!"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> 
gasped Haufmann. </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n>"You're alive!!!"</FONT><FONT 
CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
Baron von Schmitt's eyes stared up at Haufmann.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn>"Haufmann!"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> gasped 
von Schmitt. </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn>"We... failed...!"</FONT><FONT 
CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
Heinrich Haufmann could see that the Baron was close to death. That he'd
survived this long was testament to the man's physical strength. Haufmann replied...<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n>"Herr Baron, we have not failed. That is why 
you had a backup plan. And I have set
that plan in motion! I swear to you, I will finish this matter. I know the Spear's

location, and my men are retrieving it as we speak. The Reich will be reborn!"</FONT><FONT 
CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
Baron von Schmitt somehow managed a tortured smile in response to Haufmann's
promise. Struggling to speak, he raised his free arm and clutched Haufmann's
collar.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn>"Haufmann,"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> spoke 
von Schmitt.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn> "You know what to do. Good luck!"</FONT><FONT 
CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
Haufmann cradled the Baron's head in his hands.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n>"Herr Baron, I will see to it that the Allied 
dog that did this pays with his life!"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
The Baron smiled his last smile, and, pausing momentarily to cough up
blood, gazed at Haufmann and said,</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn> "Tell the 
dog that if he dares to interfere again, I'll be waiting for him in the
fires of Hell! And that... is my... dying promise!!!"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>

<BR>
With that, Baron von Schmitt drew his final breath.<BR>
<BR>
Haufmann
rose to his feet. So close had they been to success! As he looked down at the
Baron's corpse, he determined to make certain the same fate did not await himself.

After a brief pause, he hauled the Baron's corpse out from the ruins and
over into the edge of the adjoining forest. He felt that the least he could do
before departing was to give the Baron a reasonable burial.<BR>
<BR>
Far out,
riding the ocean waves in the light of dusk, a fishing trawler made its way steadily

back towards the Spanish coast. The German divers on board were happy with
their evening's work. The tracking device had made their task easy...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxFF0000b>January 1947:</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> 
It had been almost a year since you, B.J. Blazkowicz, had captured the Spear of
Destiny from the grasps of Baron von Schmitt and his henchmen. Time had healed
the wounds you'd suffered in that battle, but the memories would scar your mind
forever. Twice you'd rescued the Spear from the clutches of evil. And each time
you'd encountered the forces of an ungodly "otherworld". You'd survived, but
only by the skin of your teeth. Lady Luck had been generous to you!<BR>
<BR>
Having
gradually grown accustomed to the leisurely pursuits of peacetime, you'd
strived to put the past behind you. You'd done your bit for King and country.
The time had come for you to finally enjoy life - let others worry about the future

for once. But, on opening an envelope you'd just received in the mail, you
wondered if heroes would ever be allowed to rest!<BR>
<BR>
The letter inside
the envelope was from an old British agent colleague of yours. Requesting you
travel to Spain as soon as possible to meet with him, you wondered what in blazes

he wanted. This fellow never seemed to be a bearer of good news, having been
responsible for alerting you to the location of the Spear after it had fallen
into the clutches of Baron von Schmitt. Hopefully this time he was just wanting
to meet to chat about the "good old days"...<BR>
<BR>
And so your journey began…<BR>
<BR>
Spain.
You hadn't returned here since your battle last year to
recapture the Spear of Destiny. Returning here brought back memories you'd tried

to suppress. It was a beautiful country, no doubt, but that same countryside
had been home to an old Spanish castle that you'd prefer to forget. That castle
lay in ruins now, so you shook off those thoughts as your train pulled into the
station where your colleague had arranged to meet you.<BR>
<BR>
A few hours
later, after some friendly banter and a hearty meal, your colleague made the reason

for your visit clear. Although a large number of nazis had fled to Spain
from Germany at the end of the war, not all of them had been recruited by Baron
von Schmitt to help in his plans. Many of them had instead been instructed to
just mingle with the general population, finding work and supporting themselves,

until such time that their services were required.<BR>
<BR>
Initially, according
to your colleague, Baron von Schmitt had planned to bring these "sleepers"
back into service once his original plans of resurrecting Hitler and other prominent

nazis had been successfully carried out. But, should the plan fail, which
it had, then these "sleepers" would be called upon to assist with a backup plan.

Your colleague had only learnt of this arrangement just recently...<BR>
<BR>
Anxious
to determine if anything was taking place that may indicate renewed
nazi activities, his investigations had uncovered some documents signed by a
character named "Heinrich Haufmann". Subsequent digging uncovered further documents

dating back to almost a year ago. Of particular interest was the date marked
on the documents - late March of 1946, just after you had recaptured the Spear
of Destiny from Baron von Schmitt's clutches.<BR>
<BR>
These documents referred
to the failure of "the intended plan", and subsequent activation of a "Plan
B". It appeared that instructions had been issued by Haufmann ordering all "loyalists"

to report immediately to a particular location in a remote regional
area of the Spanish countryside. Fortunately, your colleague had recently been
able to pinpoint the exact location of this new "base of operations" for the nazis.<BR>

<BR>
The
site was a substantial mansion situated on a large estate.
Bought by the Germans before the war had even started, this estate was originally

intended for use as a holiday retreat for high ranking members of the German
hierarchy. As the war's end drew close, bribes of stolen nazi gold were made to
corrupt Spanish officials to ensure the property remained under nazi control,
and the site was used as a stopover point for nazis fleeing the crumbling Reich.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n>"And so you see, B.J.,"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> 
your colleague concluded,</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n> "when Baron von Schmitt's 
original plan to resurrect the Reich failed, Heinrich
Haufmann put this fallback plan into action. All non active loyalists were ordered

to report at the rural location in order to help with the new plan. All this
happened just under a year ago, so they've had plenty of time to get things in
motion."</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> Your friend paused, then added </FONT><FONT 
CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n>"It's a pity I hadn't discovered this earlier..."</FONT><FONT 
CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
But, you didn't see a huge problem.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn>"I wouldn't worry too much,"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn> 
you said.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn> "Easily dealt with. I can't see that 
they'd be able to achieve a great deal. Last
time, they had the Spear of Destiny in their possession. That provided more than

just a psychological advantage, let me assure you!"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>

<BR>
Your colleague frowned.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n> "I'm afraid I have some 
bad news, B.J. From what I discovered from a source last
week, they DO have the Spear..."</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>
<BR>
A sense of disbelief engulfed you. Surely they couldn't have the Spear
of Destiny! You'd disposed of it yourself; it was at the bottom of the ocean,
and finding it would have been harder than finding a needle in a dozen haystacks!<BR>

<BR>
But,
after your colleague informed you of his suspicion that Baron
von Schmitt had apparently inserted some kind of tracking device in the shaft
of the Spear, you felt like kicking yourself.<BR>
<BR>
How could you have been
so stupid?!! You should have destroyed the Spear, not hidden the thing! It
seemed that, despite your having defeated Baron von Schmitt in battle, he'd been

one step ahead of you all along. And now, because of your oversight, you found
yourself in the same situation as just over a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
The Allies,
as before, wouldn't be interested in helping. They were now too preoccupied with

their former Soviet "comrades". Besides, they'd never considered the stories
surrounding the Spear of Destiny to be any more than superstitious nonsense.<BR>

<BR>
Once
again, it would be up to you, B.J. Blazkowicz, to set things right.<BR>
<BR>
Looking
your colleague in the eye with a steely gaze, you commented</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px1CAAFFn> 
"Looks like B.J. Blazkowicz has a job to do..."</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>

<BR>
Your colleague nodded in agreement.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n> "I'll take 
you to the outskirts of the mansion's estate"</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxC0C0C0n> 
he said.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13px00FF40n> "From there, you'll be on your own. 
Remember, the estate is huge, and no doubt well
guarded. But I have faith you'll find a way in."</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-13pxn><BR>

<BR>
And so you found yourself at the edge of the property now acting as home
to the nazis activities. Light snow fell gently to the icy ground as you felt
a chill embrace your body. But you knew the chill you felt was not due to the
cold...<BR>
<BR>
This would be the third time you'd embarked on a mission to
capture the Spear of Destiny from the nazis. You'd faced the Angel of Death.
You'd faced Hitler's ghost. And now you feared you'd face Hell itself.<BR>
<BR>
Gritting
your teeth, you unsheathe your knife, and make your way slowly along
the estate's perimeter looking for an easy access point.<BR>
<BR>
Destiny awaited...</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn><BR>
