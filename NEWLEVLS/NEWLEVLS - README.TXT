      Hello,

      These two files need to have their extenions changed from .jil to .wl6
   in order for them to run.  Change your current gamemaps.wl6 and maphead.
   wl6 to .old.  Then change the .jil to .wl6.  Copy both files into the
   Wolf3D Directory and prodeed to play.  These levels were created by a
   caller of this BBS, Jill Gallup.  Please leave message as to how you
   liked the program.  Just call MIDNIGHT ESCAPE BBS at 219-456-4127.


                                               Thank You,
                                             Earl E. Gibson
