			<P>To get a Missile Launcher shoot the mutant in the doorway, run through the 
next door and shoot another in the next. If you don't you will still get it once 
you have the gold key. Start by a dead guard trick and enter the central green moss 
section. Soon an Ubermutant will discover you. Get the bronze key in a little room. 
Several passages are blocked by poison. On this floor as well as others, enemies 
may come unexpectedly at you through these passages. Pick up enough health chalices 
to get on southward for the gold key. In the northwest you find the silver key, a 
chaingun and another Ubermutant! If you enter the northern section without a gold 
key you must make it back through poison, find chalices in a secret room. From the 
northern section you enter the southeast area. Or find a secret shortcut (with a 
1-up) from the central area! Here you confront Dr Schabbs. More enemies will come 
in from other areas. Finally defeated Dr Schabbs will leave a nasty surprise! Get 
the brass key and find the elevator behind a pushwall, again there is a pool of poison 
inside it. Two more 1-ups are hidden on the floor.</P>
