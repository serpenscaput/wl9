			<P>Again there is a pistol near the start. A Missile Launcher is found in the 
room behind the armours. A pushwall a little to the south lets you get to it if you 
don't have one. This floor will leave you a lot of choices of moving. You need to 
find all the 4 keys to get through the small rooms before the elevator. Especially 
the bronze key in the southeast corner of the floor may be hard to acquire since 
you have to move through a lot of poison to get to it. The brass- and silver keys 
are found in the blue brick section, the gold key is found in the blue stone area. 
A Grosse, an Ubermutant, two Fake Hitlers and legions of enemies coming in from everywhere 
does not make things easier. Secret rooms hold 1-ups, a chaingun (in the southern 
part of the purple stone section) and other goods. A machine gun is found in the 
central area. Remember to pick up all the missiles you find, you will need them. 
A second Grosse awaits near the elevator. Be aware the pool of poison inside the 
elevator itself.</P>
