			<P>Put an end to the first "sub" mutant then make into the southern section. Watch 
out for the SS behind the barrels and grab the pistol. Enter the big hallway a little 
to the north. An SS in a room to the right will leave you a machine gun. Find your 
way to the wood panel section in the northwest, and the silver key. But now you have 
been located by a Grosse. Make it over to the brown marble section for the bronze 
key. But now more enemies have been alarmed. Make it into the red brick section, 
through the locked door near the start. Even more enemies will come at you from different 
directions. Fight them off on your way to the gold key. Past a dead guard trick in 
the south you enter the grey stone area, and are received by Grosse and others. Fight 
them running around the stone structure, look out for the many green pools. A pushwall 
lets you into the stone structure for the brass key. Follow the path to the north 
to get to the elevator. Or find your way to the northeast section. Pick up the 1-up 
and get ready for a confrontation with Giftmacher. Once he is defeated don't step 
to close. Find a second entrance to the elevator.</P>
