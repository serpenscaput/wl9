			<P>Grab the pistol and kill the two SS. Don't alarm the Ubermutant, (get the Missile 
Launcher later). Move south, get the gold key and confront a Grosse. Fight guards 
that come out of other rooms. Get Grosse into the opening hall and fight your way 
through the south western section for the silver key and ammo. Then defeat Grosse 
and get a chaingun. Powerups are in a secret room in the wood section. Get the Missile 
Launcher, fight the Ubermutant running around the block. In the western moss section, 
drop the "sub" mutants, watch the poison and the syringes. Get around a second Grosse 
for the bronze key and more ammo. Get him back to the entrance and fight him. In 
the south east a third Grosse awaits, more enemies are rushing in. Get more powerups 
including a 1-up past a secret door near the center. Defeat Grosse before moving 
north. Confront a syringe throwing, chaingun firing Professor Quarkblitz. Fight all 
the enemies coming at you from everywhere. Make it to the north west corner for the 
brass key. Now you can exit but you want to defeat Quarkblitz. With the brass key 
enter rooms with powerups including a 1-up. But be prepared for surprises!</P>
