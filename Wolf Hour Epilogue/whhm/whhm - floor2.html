			<P>Starting this level with just a knife is hard. Try to locate a guard to get 
a pistol. The best way may be to turn left (eastward), then right. Start to clean 
out the main hallways. Kill an SS in a room in the southeast section for a machine 
gun. Enter the central brown stone room and follow this path to the west. The brass 
key in the next big room lets you further into the western section where you find 
the bronze key. Then make it over to the elevator in the southeast section, look 
out for enemies coming out of locked rooms on your way.</P>
			<P>In the secret areas in the south you find the two other keys, treasure, a 1-up 
and two super guards! An Ubermutant and a Grosse brother. Defeating the latter will 
get you a chaingun.</P>
