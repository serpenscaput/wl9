			<P>You start with just a knife.</P>
			<P>When fighting the "sub" mutants try not to get surrounded. Run up to one corner 
and fight one, then to another, to confuse them. Look out for the enemies behind 
barrels etc and don't step on the green stuff. Make it to the room on the west side 
for the silver key, then cross over to the east side for the gold key. Run through 
the purple hallway and get into the next room and past the gold key door. Look out 
for the mutants. A secret door lets you slip by one of them. Get into the next hallway, 
be on the run. One more room and then it's the elevator.</P>
			<P>Past pushwalls you get to fight guards and officers and by that acquire a pistol. 
Two more keys, the bronze and the brass key, let you into more secret areas. If you 
enter the maze in the northeast past a dead guard trick you will confront a Fake 
Hitler. This can be a little hard with just a pistol. But there is enough ammo, if 
you don't waste too much. Find a 1-up and a second entrance to the elevator.</P>
