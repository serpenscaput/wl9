			<P>Several choices of moving, enemies coming at you from all directions, passages 
blocked by poison, a Grosse and an Ubermutant in the first areas...</P>
			<P>Get the bronze key in a grey room near Grosse in the northeast and the gold 
key by the Ubermutant in the wood panel section down south. The Missile Launcher 
is found in the big grey stone room north of the entrance, a chaingun is behind a 
pushwall in the blue stone section. You notice the elevator door behind a lot of 
poison in the center of the floor. Get onward to the southwest for the brass key, 
and another missile launching duel with  the third Giftmacher of this adventure! 
Once you have the brass key make it to the north, then go west. Confront a Fake Hitler 
in this area. Another Grosse waits behind the columns in the outdoor area. Fight 
your way through the red brick section to get to the silver key. A 1-up is found 
nearby in a secret room. Now you can get to the elevator from the west side. Another 
1-up is hidden elsewhere on the floor.</P>
