			<P>If you acquired the Missile Launcher on floor 4 you may pick up the missiles 
by the entrance and start to clean out the first part of the green moss section. 
Otherwise pick up the pistol and move into the northeast corner for the silver key 
and a machine gun. In a secret room you find a 1-up and more but a blue ghost will 
turn out a big nuisance. A secret area behind the entrance holds a Missile Launcher 
past a silver key door. In the green section a path of poison leads to the elevator, 
other paths are blocked by poison too. In the northwest section you get a gold key. 
But a Grosse and a red ghost are now making things rather hard. Through the green 
section south by east you get to a gold key door, but now a green ghost has joined 
the enemy forces too. The bronze key in the brown cave area will make it easier to 
get to the elevator, but an Ubermutant and a yellow ghost make things even more terrible. 
From the elevator area you may move southward, then westward. In a big room you encounter 
a second Giftmacher. Get ready for the first missile launching duel! A brass key 
in a secret room lets you get back to the elevator.</P>
