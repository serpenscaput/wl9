			<P>Grab the pistol and the brass key and fight off all the enemies, don't let 
Grosse notice you too soon. Get past the pushwall north of the entrance for powerups. 
Try to shoot a guard in the doorway behind a barrel by the SS. Confront Grosse, find 
a machine gun near him. Fight him running around the red brick structure. Then enter 
the room at the east end of the hallway. Follow this path for the silver key. More 
mutants will follow you from another room. Get through the wood panel section in 
the southwest. Past a dead guard trick you enter the main southern section. In the 
big central room General Fettgesicht awaits. Enemies in this and several other rooms 
will be alarmed once the action starts. Be careful to avoid all the poison in the 
hallways. Get the bronze key in the big room. If you defeat Fettgesicht you get a 
Missile Launcher. Test it out on any remaining enemies on your way to the elevator. 
A pushwall leads to a secret area in the northeast. If you shot a guard in the mentioned 
doorway or alarm some others in one of the olive panel rooms you get the gold key, 
and a 1-up. Locate the elevator to the secret floor.</P>
