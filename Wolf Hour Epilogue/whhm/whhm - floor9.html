			<P>Get the Missile Launcher and the chaingun before passing the dead guard trick. 
Move north. Know that you can't pick up the syringes, or the lesson will cost you! 
Get the brass- and bronze keys in the northwest. Stop by the secret room down south. 
Continue north by east. Find the silver key in the blue maze. Now things get harder. 
Missiles and syringes are scattered throughout the olive maze in the southeast, two 
Fake Hitlers are hidden inside it. Get the 1-up behind the pushwall before moving 
up to the last dead guard trick. Get ready for the final terrible countdown. Hitler 
coming at you, run around the block and into the next room, fire and have an officer 
open the door ahead. Get through alive and enter the big hallway. Fight off the enemies 
with Hitler on your heels. You have four choices of moving and more enemies coming 
at you including four Fake Hitlers. Most of the enemies killed and Hitler's armour 
broken, you may start to run out of missiles and bullets. Down to your last you defeat 
him and get the gold key. A secret door in the main hallway reveals a gold key door. 
Past the pools of poison you run out to freedom.</P>
