			<P>Turn around and get the Missile Launcher. Some guards will notice you. Forget 
about fighting your way to the south through that pack of enemies which includes 
an Ubermutant. Pick up as many missiles as you can and go through the entrance elevator 
door. And confront a second General Fettgesicht! Be on the move. And make sure to 
wade through all the missiles that are scattered on this floor. There is no ordinary 
ammo to be found (except what is dropped by the enemies). Again enemies will move 
in from every direction. Fake Hitlers are found both in the north and the south. 
Get the brass key in the central northern room. Move on to the southeast outdoor 
area for the gold key and a third Fake Hitler! The northwest outdoor area holds the 
bronze key, the northeast one holds the silver key behind a pushwall. 1-ups are found 
in three other secret rooms. After battling the other guards you move in for a missile 
launching duel with the General himself. The elevator is found in the southwest outdoor 
area. Watch out for the mutants on the outside of the elevator (as in the other outside 
areas).</P>
