
Text file accompanying the Wolf Hour Epilogue, an add-on to Wolfenstein 3-D.

Wolf Hour Epilogue v2.0.

Thank you for wanting to play the Wolf Hour Epilogue.

This level uses a slightly modified version of the Wolf Hour exe.

For copyright reasons the set requires that the player owns a registered version 
of Wolfenstein 3-D.
(The source code has not been released for all game files.)
The files included in the EPILOGUE.ZIP are:
WOLF3D.EXE
GAMEMAPS.WL6
MAPHEAD.WL6
VGADICT.WL6
VGAGRAPH.WL6
VGAHEAD.WL6
VSWAP.WL6
and EPILOGUE.TXT (this file).
(The files AUDIOHED.WL6 and AUDIOT.WL6 are NOT included).

How to install the Epilogue.
Create a new directory called Epilogue.
Copy all files from your Wolfenstein 3-D directory to the new Epilogue directory.

Unzip EPILOGUE.ZIP in the Epilogue directory and replace all files that your are 
asked to replace.
Now you can play the original Wolfenstein 3-D from its directory and Wolf Hour Epilogue 
from the new directory.

If you experiance any problems running Wolf Hour Epilogue, contact me.
Other comments are welcome too.
