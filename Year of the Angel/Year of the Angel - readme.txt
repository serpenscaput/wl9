Thanks for playing YEAR OF THE ANGEL, a map set by Thomas Weiling.

This map set merges the influence of Operation: Eisenfaust and Spear of Destiny, with mutants coming to the forefront. I had heaps of fun making these maps and hope you will likewise playing them.

Much gratitude to Gerolf for beta testing the maps and bringing invaluable input.

Cheers!
