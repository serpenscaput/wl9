This Bonkenstien3D VSWAP has been converted to version 1.4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Bonkenstien3D,

Now the treasures are much more appealing and the action is much more
bloody. Things finally make sense as those annoying elevators are 
replaced with Ultima style moongates. Treasure is now worth picking up
because it is computer supplies instead of worthless trinkets. And what
better way to kill than with the true to the heart joystick rather than
those all too boring guns.

Enjoy Bonk3D
