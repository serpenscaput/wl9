Hello! This is a Readme file created by the creater of this Mapack, Asgore89!

This mapack is pure joke. It contains many bullshat things (like glitches), is
really hard, etc.

I Am Death Incarnate is very, very, hard to do, so I do not recommend it. 
If you are playing on DOSBOX, level 3 will be complete and utter bullsh*t. I am so sorry I made that level. If you can't get through this level, feel free to 
pull it up in Mapedit (theres a mapedit.exe file in the directory by the way) to figure it out.

I made this mapack myself, but thank you so much to AstroCreep, who came up with the name for this mapack. It suits it very well. 

Good Greaking Luck, 
Asgore89
