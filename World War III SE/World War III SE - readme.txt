World War 3 SPECIAL EDITION
A Wolfenstein addon by William Hooper


I decided to redo this previous set of levels of mine just because I felt that I 
could have done a lot better :)

All of the levels are modified, with different layouts, I've also changed some textures 
and added a new title screen.



See if you can find my two secret club house areas within these episodes, you will 
enjoy the free bars :)




Enjoy, and look for my completely new set of levels coming soon, " Redemption "
