^G 16 110 [DEMOLIT]
^c[Black]




Wolf3D Demolition is a gameplay mod for Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny, as well 
as MacWolf and S3DNA, using LZWolf.  This mod adds damage types, as well as new weapons 
and death frames to demonstrate them.  In this new updated version, there are even 
more dangerous and destructive weaponry, as well as even more types of Nazis to blow 
up!
^P
^C[Red]VERSION 3 INFO


^c[Black]Wolf3D Demolition V3 introduces a few more changes compared to the last 
version.  As well as new weapons to mess around with and more stuff to destroy, there 
are also a few more key differences (read on for more info)
^P
^C[Red]MACWOLF/S3DNA SUPPORT

^c[Black]It was pretty easy to extend support to MacWolf - only required a few double 
actors and some compatibility stuff.  However, the more
interesting part is support for Super 3D Noah's Ark!  Completely new death frames

for all enemies, most objects can be destroyed, enemies are rebalanced for
extra difficulty, and not only that, now your slingshots are replaced with your
arsenal for Wolf3D Demolition.  Time to cull the herd!
^P
^C[Red]MACWOLF/S3DNA SUPPORT



^c[Black]To run this with S3DNA, simply run this just like with Wolf3D or SOD,
and select Super Noah's Ark 3D from the IWAD Selector instead!  The ogg music
included with the Steam release is highly recommended as the MIDI causes 
crashes.
^P
^C[Red]MACWOLF/S3DNA SUPPORT



^c[Black]To run with MacWolf, you will need MacWolf (obviously) and the shim file 
included.  Note that 1st and 2nd Encounter scenarios are incompatible with LZWolf 
and will need converted to 3rd Encounter format to be able to be used with LZWolf. 
 To make MacWolf appear in the IWAD selector, edit "iwadinfo.txt" within your lzwolf.pk3 
and remove the "Preview" flags from the MacWolf entries.
^P
^C[Red]MACWOLF/S3DNA SUPPORT



 ^c[Black]The shim file also supplies missing walls and sounds, so you will be able 
to play 2nd and 3rd Encounter scenarios with just this mod and the 1st Encounter 
base files.  No need for searching shady websites! (Unless you wanna play the actual 
30 level 2nd Encounter set, you're on your own for that!)
^P
^C[Red]OTHER NEW STUFF

^c[Black]*Bosses randomly spawn with different weapons!  Maybe Hans will have a chaingun. 
 Or maybe a flamethrower.  Who knows?

*New weapons and Nazis!  Even more cool stuff to break!

*Fixed cross compatibility issues by including sprites missing between games (modified 
to my liking)
^P
^C[Red]COMPATIBILITY

^c[Black]This aims to be the first LZWolf mod to achieve cross compatibility
between the different base games, making hundreds of mods available to play
with the enhanced Demolition features.  
^P
^C[Red]COMPATIBILE WITH (Vanilla)

^c[Black]*Wolfenstein 3D, shareware or registered, and all DOS mods without significant 
VSWAP changes or any code changes

*Spear of Destiny, demo or commercial, and all DOS mods without significant VSWAP 
changes or any code changes

*Super 3D Noah's Ark and any future map-only sets

*MacWolf, all Encounters, and all scenarios without significant graphic changes.

^P
^C[Red]COMPATIBILE WITH (ECWolf/LZWolf)

^c[Black]*Wolf3D MegaMap
*The Renovation ECWolf Port
*Conflict in the Fatherland ECWolf Port
*WOLFBEL Collection for ECWolf
*WOLFPAK
*SPEARPAK
*Assassinate Hitler ECWolf Port
*Countdown to Disaster ECWolf Port
*WOLFPAK 2 (some bosses are weaker than normal)
^P
^C[Red]COMPATIBILITY

^c[Black]Other mods are technically compatible with Demolition, but depending on 
changes in the original mod there may be graphical inconsistencies.  Make sure you 
load Demolition last to avoid as many as possible.  Other ECWolf mods are also partially 
compatible, but custom decorate actors WILL break functionality somewhere or another.

^P
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY

^c[Black]Aside from your normal Wolfenstein armory (with new sprites, adapted from 
the ROTT specs and the lost episodes), there are many new weapons that will randomly 
spawn in the spots where weapons used to spawn. You can also find these randomly 
scattered in barrels. 
^P^
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY


^C[DarkRed]Dual Pistols ^c[Black]- 2 pistols are better than one. Nothing makes you 
look like a pure badass like wielding 2 pistols and charging head-on into a room 
full of Nazis.

^C[DarkRed]Mega Chaingun ^c[Black]- Maybe that room had a bit too many. Never fear 
with this thing. Eats ammo at a crazy fast rate, but will clear a room faster than 
you can say Gesundheit!
^P^
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY


^C[DarkRed]Chainsaw ^c[Black]- Meat.  Fresh meat everywhere.  Just need to cut it 
up into manageable pieces.  You gotta get in close for this one, but not much is 
more satisfying than chopping Nazis.

^C[DarkRed]Shotgun ^c[Black]- Nothing can handle crowd control like a good ol'fashioned 
shotty.  Quickly put down your enemies with your trusty 12-gauge.
^P^
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY


^C[DarkRed]Bazooka ^c[Black]- Your standard missile launcher. Pummel your enemy with 
destructive rockets and make them smush like a watermelon!


^C[DarkRed]FlameThrower ^c[Black]- Who wants barbecue? These will make sure you get 
your Nazi served extra crispy.
^P
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY


^C[DarkRed]Gas Grenade Launcher ^c[Black]- Launches grenades filled with deadly toxic 
gas. Perfect for launching at a group of unsuspecting Nazis. Careful - gas hurts 
you too, and some enemies are unaffected!

^C[DarkRed]Sniper Rifle ^c[Black]- Enemies at far distances are no longer a problem 
with your fancy scope. Zoom in and BOOM! HEADSHOT!
^P
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY


^C[DarkRed]Flamewall ^c[Black]- What's scarier than a giant wall of flames moving 
toward you? Nothing, that's what. Not many can withstand the terrible scorching power 
of the Flamewall.

^C[DarkRed]FlameBazooka ^c[Black]- Think Flamewall, but opposite. Shoots a giant 
destructive fireball that sears straight through enemies, leaving a burning trail 
of destruction. Careful around this one, or else you'll barbecue yourself.
^P
^C[Red]THE WEAPONRY


^C[DarkRed]Shrink Ray ^c[Black]- Pretty self explanatory; Aim, Shoot, Shrink, Smash. 
Shrink your enemies to 1/10th of their size, and then all of a sudden you're the 
big man in the castle.

^C[DarkRed]Plasma Rifle ^c[Black]- Barrage your enemy with bright balls of plasma 
energy!  The Nazis will be pretty much DOOMed with a thing like this on your side.

^P
^C[Red]THE NAZIS

^c[Black]All of your old friends from Wolfenstein have come back, but they have also 
called in MAJOR reinforcements to battle you and your upgraded weaponry!
(Note: S3DNA has no alternate enemies as of yet, maybe in a future version!)

Here are a few of the new denizens of Wolfenstein:
^P^
^C[Red]THE NAZIS

^C[DarkRed]Guards ^c[Black]- Your standard brownshirt not only has a pistol now, 
but some of them carry deadly sniper rifles. Still just as weak as before.

^C[DarkRed]Blitzguard ^c[Black]- Who decided to give these dumbasses rocket launchers?! 
You can tell these guys apart from their normal guard counterparts by their bright 
purple uniform, however you may want to think twice about running blindly into a 
room.
^P^
^C[Red]THE NAZIS

^C[DarkRed]Kamikaze Dogs ^c[Black]- As if the Nazis weren't mean enough, they strapped 
explosives to some of their poor dogs! Unfortunately when they're running at you, 
you really don't have time to think about being kind to animals. Beware, some explode 
with gas!

^C[DarkRed]Elite SS ^c[Black]- These stormtroopers are ready for battle. Armed to 
the teeth, and sporting gas masks along with fire-resistant armor, there's not much 
to do beside chuck a rocket down their throat.
^P^
^C[Red]THE NAZIS

^C[DarkRed]Officers ^c[Black]- Officers now wield many of the same weapons you do, 
like flamethrowers and bazookas. At least you'll get a cool weapon when you pop one. 
The red ones are fire resistant.

^c[DarkRed]Mutants ^c[Black]- There's now many varieties of these undead monstrosities. 
Some will tear you up with cleavers, some will blast you with guns, and some have 
giant flamethrowers attached to their hands. Not only that, but they're immune to 
gas and feel no pain. 
^P^
^C[RED]OTHER FEATURES

^c[Black]*Breakable Scenery! Almost everything is able to be destroyed! 

*Enhanced bosses! Some now wield flamethrowers and other weapons! (Beware the Pacman 
secret level. Just run.)

*New sprite, sounds and other changes and fixes (without straying too far from the 
original Wolf3D style)
