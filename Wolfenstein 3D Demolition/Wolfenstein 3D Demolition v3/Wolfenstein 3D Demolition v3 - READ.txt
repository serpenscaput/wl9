INSTRUCTIONS:

PC Wolf / SOD: Load lzwolf from commandline with C:/blah/lzwolf.exe -file Wolf3D_Demolition.pk3,

or drag and drop the file onto the EXE.  Choose the Wolfenstein 3D or Spear of Destiny 

IWAD selection.  If you are playing with other mods, be sure to load the
Demolition pk3 last, to avoid as much graphical interference as possible.

Noah's Ark: Load lzwolf from commandline with C:/blah/lzwolf.exe -file Wolf3D_Demolition.pk3,

or drag and drop the file onto the EXE.  It is highly recommended that you also
load noah3d.wad (included with bought copies of S3DNA) which has OGG renditions
of the game music.  The midi music is known to crash LZWolf.  If and when
Noah mapsets are released, be sure to load the Demolition pk3 last to avoid
as much graphical interference as possible.

MacWolf: Load lzwolf from commandline with C:/blah/ecwolf.exe -file Mac_Shim.pk3 
Wolf3D_Demolition.pk3,
or drag and drop the file onto the EXE.  If running with 1st encounter, you must 
use
Mac_Shim_Demo.pk3 instead of Mac_Shim.pk3, to avoid palette errors.  This shim
is required until MacWolf support in LZWolf is completed.  If playing with a
MacWolf scenario, be sure to load the Demolition pk3 last to avoid as much
graphical interference as possible.  Note that all Mac scenarios must be in
a MacBinary (easiest way is through terminal on a modern Mac computer, type
"macbinary encode" and then drag and drop file to terminal window) and also
ECWolf only has support for 3rd encounter scenario files, so 1st and 2nd
encounter scenarios (WolfEdit format) must be converted to a 3rd Encounter
scenario with WolfEdit before it can be loaded with LZWolf.  The Demo shim included

will also allow 2nd/3rd encounter mods to function correctly with the 1st encounter

game files, so no need to search pirating websites for obscure files!  This specific

shim file supplies the missing sounds and walls (no sprites since this mod makes 
those
unnecessary)
