Thanks for downloading THE REVOCATION, a map set by Thomas Weiling for SPEAR RESURRECTION originally made by the great AReyeP & MCS. Well, I don't know. I thought it was fun to mess with the mod for a change, after having been enamored and inspired by it for more than twenty years. It is truly one of the most groundbreaking, interesting and self-contained mods that never fails to impress me in terms of its mapping design, coding, storyline and underlying humour. I put together 11 levels - there is a secret level in there too - and though the ending might be a bit abrupt I can honestly say that I enjoyed making this set and one day maybe I will do the full 23 original levels justice. But that's for another time... Lol.

I want to dedicate this set to ack and AReyeP, two genuine mapping masters that continue to impress me after all this time. I am honored to have e-mailed with them both over these couple of years. Thanks!

Enjoy the set! Some of the design might be a bit too goofy for Spear Resurrection but I liked to test its limits and see what could be done and what could not be done. I found that with MCS behind the keys, anything is more or less possible.

Cheers!
