Details:
---------

This is the full version of the game. Everything's closed up, but there
may be still some bugs, less they don't interrupt playing (in most cases
they are just language mistakes in readme/help art/end art files, no one is
perfect). I played with source and art 5 months of-and-on, with help of
people listed below. I'd like to thank them and may the Force of Dark Side
be with them.

Anyway, feel free to play the game ;)... of course, it's your choice, you
downloaded it. Also, drop me a mail with regards, bug fixes, questions or
whatsoever. I very much like to open new e-mails, you know...

Last Word: Don't look at the dates of some files in the archive. My old, crusty CMOS 
battery in my old computer (1993 :) had a reset and forget anything.. date too. At 
first CMOS reset I had 1 January 1801, so that's not so bad :].
