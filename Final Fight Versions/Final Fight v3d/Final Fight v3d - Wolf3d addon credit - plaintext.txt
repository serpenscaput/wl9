OTHER:
Thanks to Eric Lin for hosting the Wolf3D Haven forum, which brought so many people 
together to work on this mod. Also, to drchainsaw, Eric and others who beta tested 
the levels.

Thanks to the Dome for its coding tutorials, especially the helpart tutorial.

And for the last, thanks to id Software for making Wolfenstein 3D and for providing 
the source code. Without them and their game, we'd have no addons.
