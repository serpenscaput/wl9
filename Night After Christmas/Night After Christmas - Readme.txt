THE NIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS

A MOD IN A WEEK BY RINGMAN

This is my first ever mod.  I would like to give special thanks to the makers of 
the Batman TC for providing some of my artwork.  They don't know yet...

I did this mod in 6 days, all by myself.  YAY!

The story goes like this:

You are a cop, who has just settled down in bed after a lovely christmas.  However 
you hear noises outside as if someone is breaking in the house.  You ready your pistol, 
and look outside the window.  There are tons of thugs raiding the toys r' us and 
the bar.  Santa musn't have made them very happy on christmas, because there is a 
riot outside. Thugs are running around looting the place with guns, and dogs are 
loose all over the street.

Santa is holed up in his "Shanty" armed to the teeth ready to take on anyone that 
gets in his way.  The fatman ruined christmas for everyone and now he has got to 
pay.  However, the only one who has a spare key is Santa's drunkerd brother, Steve. 
 The only problem is the door to the bar is locked too because of the ruckus outside. 
 You figure you better start investigating the Toy's R' Us.  Now get out there and 
take out the trash!  If you want to survive the night you had better make your way 
to the garage for a better weapon...  

GOAL

There are five regions in the level:

Your House

The Bar

Santa's Shanty

Toy's R' Us 

and the town streets.

Have fun!

Note: There are no secrets, but there is still plenty of treasure hidden in certain 
nooks and crannies.
