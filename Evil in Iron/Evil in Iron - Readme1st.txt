                              "EVIL IN IRON"


    ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS SINCE B.J. RECOVERED THE SPEAR FROM THE EVIL DEATHKNIGHT.

YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THE ALLIED CORPS FIELD OFFICE IN  FRANCE FOR 
A MEETING WITH THE ALLIED HIGH COMMAND.. RUMORS HAVE CIRCULATED FOR
MONTHS CONCERNING A "SUPER" ARMOUR THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE NAZIS.
A PERSON WEARING THIS ARMOUR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND AN ATTACK BY 
VIRTUALLY ANY TYPE OF WEAPON.....YOU MUST GO TO GERMANY AND STEAL THE PLANS FOR
THE ARMOUR AND DESTROY THE 1 EXAMPLE IN EXISTANCE BEFORE HITLER CAN PUT IT INTO 

PRODUCTION!  GO NOW TO GERMANY, AND ON TO CASTLE HEINMAKKER, AND FACE THE 
DANGERS YOU KNOW TOO WELL....ANOTHER DAMP, DARK, STINKY CASTLE, FILLED WITH
MURDERING NAZI FILTH......WAITING FOR YOU.
