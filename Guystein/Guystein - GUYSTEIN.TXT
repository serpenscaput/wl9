Files in this zip-file 'Guystein.zip'
-------------------------------------

Vswap.wl6 (some objects and walls are a little bit changed in order
and image - if you play the rounds with your vswap file it won't be
that nice).
Maphead.wl6 (very necessary!)
Gamemaps.wl6 (idem)
Guystein.txt (this file)

With these files you can play Guystein if you have the registered
version of Wolfenstein 3D.
The only thing you have to do is to alter the original files 
Vswap.wl6', 'Maphead.wl6' and 'Gamemaps.wl6' into '*.old' extensions.
Then unzip 'Guystein.zip' into your Wolfenstein directory.
The files in the zip are not made on a computer with a right date
programmed, so that's the reason why they are from 1998 (but I
ensure you they were made from Oktober 1999 untill January 2000).


The game
--------

I have no specific story about the game; just use the story of the
original game.
The aim isn't changed: Just kill everybody who wants to kill you.
Every round has in my game 149 bad guys, except every 9th round from
a level (there are 148 bad guys).
So it is a very high filled game; you will use a lot the F8 key (even
more the F9 key).
Because of this mass of enemies, sometimes (it happens not often) the
game will stop abrupt after being killed with a message 'Out of memory'.
I have tried to minimise this situation as much as possible, but you
are warned.
If you never want to see this message, you will have to play in GOD
mode (but this isn't fun).
So I have only used the 'easy guys' (not the Superbosses).
One reason for doing this is that I don't like them.
But don't panic; Ten 'easy guys' who come to chase you in the same time
is about one Superboss (I ensure this).
There is one exception on the rule of 'no Superbosses', namely
level 6 - round 9 (here there are 15 'Ghost Hitlers' - my favorite
Superbosses).
The secret chambers are most of the time easy to find (tip: a basket is
very often a secret door).
The elevator to the secret level is to be found on 1 - 1 - 7 - 3 - 5 - 3
(like the original game).


Free mailware
-------------

I don't know this term exist, but this is what I mean with it.
As you will see: Level 3, level 4 and level 6 are already playable
(the other ones aren't fun if you begin to play them).
But in the zip file 'Guystei2.zip' (included within the zip file
'Guystein.zip') there are the files 'Gamemaps.wl6' and 'Maphead.wl6'.
If you install these instead of the other ones included in
'Guystein.zip', you will be able to play the six new episodes.
But the files in the zip file 'Guystei2.zip' are protected with a password.
You receive the password from me if you send me a mail (I like getting
mail).
That's what I call 'Free mailware'.

NB. If you don't want to mail me, you can find the code yourself.
Here is a tip
	THESE TWO MEN HAVE FOUND A TEST TO TEST WHETHER A GIVEN
	DATASET HAS A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDE THE '-')
		.......-....

(I've studied mathematics at the University, so you won't find it
in a common math book - I think).

Contact me
----------

If you like this stuff, please mail me too.
If you find something wrong in a level (some things you don't like)
and you have a good suggestion you may mail it to.
If there are still errors (you can't get out of a level for some
reason or something else), mail me.
Maybe some people recognize some things in my rounds that they have 
in their rounds too.  I admit I have copied some things in some rounds,
but I never copied a whole round (I guess).  I 'm afraid I can't give
the references of my rounds (some crashes in my computer have deleted
much great files).



IMPORTANT!: DON'T COMPLAIN TO APOGEE IF YOU EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH
		THIS FREEWARE.  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, MAIL TO ME (PLEASE
		NOT TO OFTEN).  I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR COMPUTER START
		TO CRASH OR TO DO THINGS YOU DON'T ASK HIM TO DO!


Thanks to everybody who likes this add-on.

Thanks for playing Guystein!
