                            --WOLFENSTEIN 3D XL--
                           =======================

Thank you for Downloading Wolfenstein 3D. This 
edition works exactly the same as the origial game 
(except the .WL6 files are converted to .MAN files).

WARNING:

It's not a good idea to run these files outside of the Chokage
Menu. Make sure to always exit the program before turning off 
your computer (or your saved games will be lost - and, another
thing, your first save game must be saved in top slot). If you 
experience any problems with this program after TAMPERING with 
files or trying to run this gamein any OTHER WAY then from the 
Chokage Menu, let me know! I'd love hearing hacker stories. :D

More info:

Wolfenstein XL was created to let wolf fans enter the ALL TIME
WOLFENSTEIN HIGHSCORES. But since the GAME itself is exactly the 
same as the original, you won't need to keep the original version 
of Wolf3D after updating to Wolfenstein XL (plus, this version 
takes up 500K less hard drive space because of it's connection
with Chokage.)

Updated July 2004 (v01):

Some of the features here are still in Beta Phase, but now you
can make use of an ingame timer on Don't Hurt Me to practice (if
you beat level 1 in under 60 seconds), full screen mode, and the
saved games will keep track of ALOT more info. I'll tell you
some of these fun statistics once you send in your record.


*******************************
How to get in the Highscores: 
*******************************

Whenever you notice your score/time is large enough to go into the 
'Wolfenstein All Time World Records Page', instead of typing 1 in
the WOLF-XL Menu to play Wolfenstein, type 3 (this will appear
after you save your game). Rules are as followed:

  Score competitions:

   - No rules, save your game anywhere in the game, and if your score is
     in the top 10 of it's class (episode), and it will be added.

  Time Competitions:

   - For an episode record, save your game anywhere in level 9 of
     the episode after you've raced through it.
   - If you're sending in a time for a level, just save anywhere after
     the level is finished. It will keep track of your level times.

Have fun!
