Thanks for downloading KOWTOW, a mod made by Thomas Weiling in collaboration with 
AlumiuN.
I started making this mod in late August 2019, finishing it off in late November. 
Watch out for Nazis, goofs, plenty of booze and some pretty neat new tunes. Thanks 
to the following artists:

Gentle Giant
King Crimson
Genesis
Black Sabbath
Electric Light Orchestra
Jethro Tull

Some of the old Wolf & Spear tunes get a nice shuffle around. Thanks to the Wolf 
community for support, and special thanks to Arielus for inspiring me to make more 
levels.
Extra special thanks to AlumiuN for putting up with constant changing and rearranging, 
always working and providing at the speed of light.

KOWTOW contains 20 levels, one of which is a secret level. There is no actual structure 
as such, other than the final showdown with Hitler in the final level.
I hope that people will have fun with this mod, so I have been very kind with the 
ammo this time. At least I'd like to think so... Lol.

A full list of credits appears during the intro screens.

Thanks for playing & feel free to drop me a comment if you discover any unintentional 
weirdness in the mod.

Cheers!
