KOWTOW (ECWolf Port)
mod by Thomas Weiling 2019

20 brand new levels, numerous new graphics and a small host of new
sounds and music. 

The coding for the original SDL version is courtesy of AlumiuN 
who did a great job. Some of the new features include: 

* 20 new & gargantuan levels (Including one secret level) 
* Ammo limit greatly raised (The player can now obtain 500 bullets!) 
* New ceiling colors/floor colors 
* 2 new enemies added 
* Animated objects 
* Extra static objects 
* Extra wall textures
