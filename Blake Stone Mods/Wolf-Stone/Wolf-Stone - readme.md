Wolf-Stone is a Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold mod which brings the levels from Wolfenstein 3D into the Blake Stone game.

Place the MAPHEAD.BSP,  MAPTEMP.BSP, and bstone.exe files into your Blakestone root directory. Run bstone.exe.

The mod is a work in progress, and at the moment only the first episode has been completed (9 levels in total). That said, the level has been ported as it and textures are mapped oddly due to it.

Packaged with this mod is bstone.exe. This ensures level 3 places you in the right area (still trying to figure out why original versions place you incorrectly, but I believe it's because the source port is based on version 1, and the available copies to purchase are based on version 2 of the game).

The packaged source port is credited to Boris I. Bendovsky and can be found here: http://bibendovsky.github.io/bstone/
