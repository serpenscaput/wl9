  <p class="MsoNormal">Welcome to Mad Cow 90&nbsp; Err... make that BSE90 (the
  most unoriginal title in the history of gaming).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Preamble:</u></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I have been working on and off making maps for this set
  pretty much since the day I first got a hold of MapEdit (I love you Bill
  Kirby!).&nbsp; While it would be easy and melodramatic of me to say this has
  been a work in progress for almost 20 years, it hasn't.&nbsp; To say my first
  Blake Stone maps sucked is an understatement.&nbsp; I've always wanted to do a
  full 90-level <i>Aliens of Gold</i> set.&nbsp; Back in 2003 when I first
  started working on <i>acktung!</i> and <i>Halls of Stonehenge</i> I decided I
  wanted to do a map replacement set for all games using the Wolf3D
  engine.&nbsp; The dream was reborn.&nbsp; For the most part I have
  accomplished that other that <i>Rise of the Triad</i> and I can't see myself
  doing that set.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Should dig up the <i>OBC/Corridor 7</i>
  stuff, but that will have to come another day.&nbsp; Hmmm... same applies for
  my <i>Noah</i> set.&nbsp; I digress.&nbsp; Most of these maps have been made
  over the past eight years.&nbsp; I guess that means I am averaging a map a
  month.&nbsp; Oy.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I
  guess the first thing I should mention is that there is a reason why I call
  this project an experiment.&nbsp; No one else I know has worked with <i>Blake
  Stone: Aliens of Gold</i> to the fullest extent.&nbsp; I have no sources to
  draw from and had to find answers to my own questions when I ran into
  technical issues or mapping anomalies.&nbsp; Will there be bugs within these
  maps?&nbsp; Sadly it is probably inevitable.&nbsp; So as much as I hate to say
  it… PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.&nbsp; So there.&nbsp; I have done my best to test
  each level and to do so using as many variables as I could.&nbsp; With 90
  levels of intense game play (love my ego?), it is inevitable that I missed
  something.&nbsp; I could have sent these levels to my cohorts for testing, but
  who has time to test 90 levels?&nbsp; The other thing is expertise.&nbsp; Most
  of my friends and acquaintances aren’t completely in tune to all the nuances
  of testing <i>BS</i> anyway.&nbsp; I am not going to ask them to jump into
  that kind of learning curve for a one-time set of levels.&nbsp; If you find
  bugs, I apologize here and now.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b><u>Technical
  stuff &amp; support.</u></b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Well…
  Here’s my way of a-thinkin’ bout this.&nbsp; If you can play <i>Blake
  Stone</i> comfortably on your PC then you should be able to play these levels
  as well, as nothing in the design should mess with your system.&nbsp; This is
  just a map replacement set after all.&nbsp; If you haven’t played <i>BS: AoG</i>
  on your current PC and discover issues in getting the game to run properly
  that simply isn’t my problem.&nbsp; I haven’t tried this game on newer
  O/S’s or any O/S that isn’t part of the Windows environment - ain’t
  gonna either.&nbsp; I am not testing it with DOSBOX or VDMSound or any kind of
  simulator or emulator software.&nbsp; That is why this set of levels comes
  unsupported for anything technical.&nbsp; I am willing to fix mapping errors,
  but for PC related issues you should talk to your friends, neighbours, and any
  or all eggheads.&nbsp; There may even be a <i>Blake Stone</i> community out
  there (I have never searched) or some kind of message board where you can get
  a response to an issue you have.&nbsp; I don’t tend to blog solely because I
  am tired of people passing fiction off as fact or the uninformed posting
  senseless comments and reviews.&nbsp; I have better things to do with my time
  than read tripe.&nbsp; Ooops… off on a tangent again.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Installation
  is relatively simple.&nbsp; This file was probably in a zip you downloaded (my
  super-genius brain figured that out all by itself).&nbsp; Also in that zip
  would be maptemp and maphead file.&nbsp; These are what need to be placed into
  your <i>BS: AoG</i> directory.&nbsp; Of course this will overwrite your
  original maptemp/maphead file.&nbsp; You might want to consider moving the
  original maphead/mapead file (or rename them) so that you can go back to
  playing the original whenever you want.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The
  zip should contain three files.&nbsp; The maptemp and maphead files
  (redundancy is a lost art) are two and this baby err… readme makes three.&nbsp;
  I thought about including a batch file that allows you to cheat, but changed
  my mind.&nbsp; If you already know how to add parameters, add –powerball to
  your command line on the file you use to start the game.&nbsp; When starting
  the game, press both shift keys when the “JAM” screen appears and let them
  go when the “PG13” screen appears (unless of course you are under the age
  of 12 and have no parental supervision then you should go play with your
  Lego).&nbsp; A full list of cheats can be found on-line.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b><u>Known
  bugs:</u></b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Anomaly
  #1: I have seen instances where once perscan drones have imploded and I have
  left and then re-entered the area in question that the debris has disappeared
  and an invisible wall is left in its place.&nbsp; For the most part I have
  narrowed down the cause and tried to remove any instance of this occurring,
  but I may have not caught all instances.&nbsp; Don’t confuse this with
  overhead lights that are impassable.&nbsp; I used those sparingly solely
  because they are confusing/frustrating.&nbsp; I am also checking to see if
  this has anything to do with projectile spewing aliens.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Anomaly
  #2: All games using the same base engine of this era suffer from the same
  thing – object overload.&nbsp; Have you ever noticed that if you kill a
  large number of enemies in a small area that they will flash or
  disappear/re-appear?&nbsp; The main cause is that there are too many objects
  on the screen.&nbsp; If you collect dropped ammo and food tokens and pick up
  health/ammo/treasure then this should rarely happen (in other words – DO NOT
  CHEAT!!!).&nbsp; The nice thing about the BS engine is a lot of the graphics
  from dead guards gets removed once you leave a room (if the game’s object
  count is too high).&nbsp; This helps even things out.&nbsp; I have done my
  best to try to prevent this from happening (see guard block floor code, as an
  example)</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Anomaly
  #3: This hasn’t happened to me often and I can’t replicate the scenario,
  but I have had an issue with objects and scientists being passable – that
  is, you can walk through the scientists or you can walk over objects without
  picking them up.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; I have been able to remove all instances
  that I have found, but there is apt to be more.&nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of this has
  to do with placement of moving guards (and those pesky fluid aliens) and I
  have tried to exhaustively test this phenomenon.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b><u>How
  about a tip or two or 17?&nbsp;</u></b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #1: Use the auto-charge pistol to blast open crates.&nbsp; Conserves ammo as
  not all crates will open.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #2: Use the auto-charge pistol to open alien canisters.&nbsp; Why waste ammo?</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #3: Dr. Goldfire can appear only in certain areas outside of boss levels (and
  of course on all boss levels found on the ninth floor of each episode).&nbsp;
  Much like a bad habit, he can come back once he’s been kicked.&nbsp; Don’t
  want that to happen?&nbsp; Don’t re-enter the room.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #4: Enemies with guns can shoot and hit you from anywhere.&nbsp; Many of the
  aliens cannot shoot through objects like tables as their projectiles will
  explode upon contact.&nbsp; Don’t stand near the object as you can still get
  splayed by projectiles.&nbsp; You can dispose of these kinds of aliens by
  using your auto-charge pistol (if you are patient).&nbsp; Yes, ammo saving is
  a life-style choice.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #5: Your auto-charge pistol is silent – use it wisely (where have I heard
  that before?).&nbsp; You might occasionally warp into an area where the
  dumbass guards are deaf and facing the wrong way (or are they just listening
  to their iPods?).&nbsp; Oh what fun to pick them off like ducks in a shooting
  gallery.&nbsp; Oh my, the SPCA might not like my using ducks as they are
  pretty little critters and need protection (mmm… orange sauce).&nbsp; Insert
  liberals into that sentence instead (j/k).</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #6: If you cheat your high score won’t get recorded.&nbsp; Ha ha ha ha ha ha&nbsp;
  weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #7: If you are the kind of person who thinks shooting a guard in an open door
  space to keep the door open is an awesome offensive strategy (and it was
  TWENTY YEARS AGO) then you will hate me.&nbsp; Well, maybe not me, but you
  will hate some of these levels (and you might question why my parents had
  kids).&nbsp; Thanks to what we call a ‘guard block floor code’ I am able
  to prevent all guards/enemies from walking in certain areas.&nbsp; And yes, I
  will force you (on occasion) to actually enter rooms and do battle like a true
  warrior instead of like a pasty-assed wimp.&nbsp; Oooh… that was harsh!&nbsp;
  </span></font><font face="Wingdings"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">J</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #8: And the nastiness continues… If you think that the whole world should
  always unfold directly in front of you, then delete these levels now.&nbsp; I
  am sick, sick, sick, SICK of one-dimensional game play.&nbsp; Yes, it is fine
  to have some levels and some areas where guards do not sneak up from behind
  you or come at you from two different angles.&nbsp; Some levels.&nbsp; SOME!&nbsp;
  Put 90-levels of that crap in one place and you have created overkill.&nbsp;
  There are traps in these levels – don’t kid yourself.&nbsp; However, in
  the name of balance, I don’t do it repeatedly either.&nbsp; I have tried
  very hard to mix things up.&nbsp; Some of you will like it, some will hate it.&nbsp;
  Life rolls on.&nbsp; Overall levels do get more complex as you progress
  through the game and so do the challenges.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #9: Some enemies (I am not telling you which ones as the Security Guards and
  Human Mutants would not like it) will shot at you from a distance while they
  will try to punch if you are up close.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; Try to
  manoeuvre (as I confuse my American friends with actual English) so that see
  you at a distance, but then duck and come out shooting when they have moved
  close enough in and start trying to hit you.&nbsp; Quick and easy disposal.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #10: Fluid aliens are a PAIN!!!&nbsp; But I love using them in maps (as a
  lunatic giggle wells in belly).&nbsp; They are predictable too in their own
  way.&nbsp; Ever play Peek-a-boo as a kid?&nbsp; Ever thought you would be
  playing it in a space station?&nbsp; I’m not totally sure, but I think that
  was a hint (or tip).</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #11: In the painfully obvious department: if you have ever blown up a volatile
  transport (and hey… who hasn’t?) you know that on occasion they leave
  toxic chemicals in their wake.&nbsp; Standing in waste does minimal damage to
  your health, but try to blow them up in open spaces so you can manoeuvre
  around better.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #12: A nudge is as good as a wink – say no more (sheesh… couldn’t make
  it through writing the readme without one cheesy Monty Python reference).&nbsp;
  It pays to be pushy.&nbsp; If you don’t like the direction that a scientist
  or volatile transport is heading, you can give them a gentle nudge or stand in
  their way to encourage them to move in a different direction.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #13: There’s a penguin on the telly!&nbsp; Okay… make that two Cleesey
  comments… oops, I mean cheesy.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #14:&nbsp; Remember that eating too many moon pies will give you a sugar rush
  and try to take it easy on the beer and hooch as they mess with your aim.&nbsp;
  Oh wait… that’s in Redneck Rampage.&nbsp; Never mind.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #15:&nbsp; Switch hitting is a good thing.&nbsp; No, I am not talking about
  baseball or sexuality.&nbsp; If a barrier controlled by a switch is down then
  an enemy can walk across (unless there is a school crossing guard near by –
  and yes, the jokes get worse) the fallen barrier.&nbsp; Should the player
  (hey… that would be you!!!) hit the barrier switch while the enemy crosses,
  the enemy will get fried.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Dead as a door nail.&nbsp; That’s
  not saying much as I have yet to see a living door nail.&nbsp; Well, maybe
  Dick Cheney, but please don’t tell him as I don’t want to get sued.&nbsp;
  So, in short, flicking a switch up and down can sometimes kill a few bad guys.&nbsp;
  It can also kill the scientists.&nbsp; That is a very bad thing.&nbsp; VERY
  bad.&nbsp; Naughty, even.&nbsp; Mind you, hunting with Cheney has been known
  to have almost the same effect.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #16: While electrospheres can be a nuisance (hey, the loyalists speak the
  truth) they also move in one of three patterns.&nbsp; They either move
  north/south, east/west, or diagonally.&nbsp; Since they can only cause harm on
  contact, taking them out with your zapper… oops… I mean your
  auto-discharge thingie makes the most sense.&nbsp; The only time they are
  really a pain is when they move diagonally as their path can be a little hard
  to judge.&nbsp; Because I am mischievous, you will occasionally get warped
  into a spot where you are surrounded by the little suckers.&nbsp; Have no
  fear; they will not touch you if you don’t move.&nbsp; Try shooting them
  before moving.&nbsp; Unless you are into pain.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">TIP
  #17: SPOILER!!!!&nbsp; In the final episode all the secret levels are accessed
  from the ninth level.&nbsp; Each secret level requires you to beat a boss from
  a prior episode.&nbsp; The interesting thing about the sixth episode is that
  when you kill ANY boss it will tell you to go shoot those random power
  generator thingies.&nbsp; These do NOT exist on the secret levels.&nbsp; The
  10 generators only exist on level 9 and you need to get past Goldfire and the
  Reptilian Warrior in order to find them.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b><u>A
  word to the wise, the inane, and the mentally challenged:</u></b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Save
  early – save often – save in multiple slots (you’ve been warned).&nbsp;
  There is a reason I am suggesting this.&nbsp; I normally save at the beginning
  of each level in one slot and then in two or three slots while in the midst of
  a level.&nbsp; I do this in case I get stuck or put into an uncompromising
  position from which there is no escape.&nbsp; There are sections of BSE90 that
  are difficult although most have ways to survive depending on your ability to
  think and your reflexes.&nbsp; More on that later.&nbsp; Saving will (and
  let’s all hold hands and say this together)… PREVENT YOU FROM HAVING TO
  RESTART YOUR GAME/LEVEL IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS.&nbsp; I’m getting preachy
  again, can ya tell?</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Should
  you cheat?&nbsp; YES!!!&nbsp; Should you cheat?&nbsp; NO!!!&nbsp; Hmm… my
  father was right.&nbsp; I am a contradiction in terms.&nbsp; I would
  definitely run the game with the cheat parameters enabled.&nbsp; This will
  allow you to warp, get extra ammo, or use the other cheat features in event
  you find yourself stuck.&nbsp; That is the only time you should consider
  cheating (unless you want to unlock all floors and just play your favourites).&nbsp;
  Why shouldn’t you cheat?&nbsp; This game was designed to be an enjoyable
  challenge.&nbsp; Cheating completely takes away from that.&nbsp; That and
  there are some minor technical issues.&nbsp; If you don’t pick up ammo and
  health it messes with the object count and can cause problems within the game
  (and make the plasma discharger useless when you need it most).&nbsp; In
  testing I have also seen instances of where when I kill one of the bosses
  (Acid Dragon, to be specific) the gold key card does not appear, making it
  impossible to finish the level (happens only when I am in God mode).&nbsp;
  You’ve been told.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The
  scientists are your friends!&nbsp; Always remember that you can get ammo and
  food tokens from the friendly scientists (and that the loyalists will attempt
  to fry your sorry little ass).&nbsp; On some levels it is extremely important
  to get some help from the scientists as ammo and health are not always in
  abundant supply.&nbsp; In fact there is one secret level with no health or
  ammo to be found – just a whole lotta scientists.&nbsp; That level is a trip
  on the highest skill.&nbsp; I hope that I placed enough scientists on each
  level so that it is possible to always get the 50000 point bonus for not
  killing any of them (the game randomly assigns how many loyalists are on a
  level so don’t blame me – lol).&nbsp; I would highly suggest you try to
  earn that bonus solely for the reason that on some levels it is extremely
  challenging.&nbsp; Well, that and you don’t want to make me cry.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Who
  says you can’t go back?&nbsp; If you find yourself low on supplies you can
  always head back to the elevator and return to an earlier floor and grab some
  goodies.&nbsp; A little forethought in this regard can go a long way.&nbsp;
  And since my niceless level is nearing an all-time low you can expect to find
  some levels where returning to the elevator is a major challenge.&nbsp; It
  really helps mix things up as I hate stagnation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Barriers
  and their switches are fun.&nbsp; In the information window (lower left of
  your screen) it will state on what level the barrier has been deactivated when
  hitting the switch.&nbsp; Most switches activate barriers on the same floor.&nbsp;
  In a few instances they will drop the barriers on a secret level or vice
  versa.&nbsp; Sometimes raising barriers is a good thing.&nbsp; Who says that
  we shouldn’t let walls come between us?&nbsp; We should build barriers and
  not break them down!!!&nbsp; I’m not talking racial injustice or anything of
  a sensitive nature.&nbsp; Sometimes impeding your path with also impede the
  path of the enemies on the other side of the barrier.&nbsp; Sheesh… that was
  almost a hint!!!</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">As
  you probably know teleporters can take you to spots within a level or to one
  of the secret levels.&nbsp; Because I am a devious little prick you really
  should consider SAVING before entering a teleporter. &nbsp;It’s not
  mandatory… I am just making a subtle suggestion.&nbsp; Normally you will
  just go to another section of the map full of sunflowers and jellybeans with
  little cherubs gaily prancing around.&nbsp; Other times you will get eaten by
  alien life forms.&nbsp; So trust me… save.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">And
  now a little note on one-ways doors, teleporters and other points of no
  return.&nbsp; With the use of teleporters and one-way doors I have been able
  to add numerous elements of game play to make these levels interesting (and by
  ‘interesting’ what I really mean is ‘devious’ or perhaps even
  ‘evil’ in a non-Satanic way).&nbsp; The downside is that any time a player
  is forced to make a decision it opens up a ton of problems from the mapping
  perspective.&nbsp; To some degree I have to trust that a player will be smart
  enough NOT to enter a one-way door or teleporter with little or no ammo or
  health as you have no idea what is on the other side.&nbsp; Granted, sometimes
  you will have no choice but to use the teleporter or on-way door.&nbsp; So it
  goes&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Hmm… would now be a good time to tell you to save once
  in a while?&nbsp; Hmm…?</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Keycards!!!!&nbsp;
  I know you were waiting with baited breath eagerly anticipating this section.&nbsp;
  You probably know that you need the red card to get to the next level (and if
  you didn’t, you do now, unless you are forgetful, then why read anything
  anyway?).&nbsp; The other cards are green, blue, yellow, and gold.&nbsp; Gold
  cards will only be found on the boss levels (I’m lying).&nbsp; The other
  cards can be found on most levels (now I am not lying… unless I am lying
  about lying or not lying about not lying – damn double negative).&nbsp;
  Sometimes, because I love you all so much, I will place multiple cards of one
  colour on a level and let you decide what door to open first.&nbsp; Will it be
  chaos?&nbsp; Will it be treasure?&nbsp; Will you save your game in multiple
  slots like I keep asking you to?&nbsp; Will Bruce Willis ever win an Oscar?&nbsp;
  If you ever decide to do some designing, I can tell you that the ability to
  have multiple locked doors on a level adds a very interesting element to game
  play (as long as it isn’t over done).&nbsp; Keycards can often be carried
  from one level to another and don’t expect to be able to do that often.&nbsp;
  Normally it isn’t part of the game play.&nbsp; I did experiment with that,
  but thought it would confuse or frustrate players as to why they are missing a
  keycard or have an extra.&nbsp; In the few cases where I did use it, you
  probably won’t even notice as it was done with subtlety.&nbsp; Hmm… when
  have I ever been accused of being subtle?</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The
  episode structure is constant.&nbsp; There are eight levels along with a boss
  level in each episode.&nbsp; There is also a secret level (called level 0).&nbsp;
  One of the bonuses of this set is that each episode features five extra secret
  levels (levels 11 through 14).&nbsp; Some of the bonus levels are fun and/or
  sadistic and potentially visually pleasing.&nbsp; If you are into maximum
  point scoring, these are highly suggested.&nbsp; I have always (and always
  will) do interesting things with the design of secret levels.&nbsp; Some you
  may love and others you may hate.&nbsp; So it goes.&nbsp; Some people will
  hate what others love and vice versa.&nbsp; What is a guy to do?&nbsp; Oh,
  that’s right… I don’t care.&nbsp; I can’t please everyone so I tried
  to include enough deviation so that most people will enjoy most of the levels.&nbsp;
  With 90 levels I had to use as much variance as I could between the levels so
  that it doesn’t feel like you are playing the same level repeatedly.&nbsp; I
  did my best to toss as many game play concepts into the game as possible.&nbsp;
  With all the different enemies (and their respective AI) mixed with all the
  special features I was able to create some interesting situations.&nbsp; Some
  require thought, others require reflexes, and some require luck – lol.&nbsp;
  I did my best to showcase each in its own way.&nbsp; Yeah, so it goes…</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I think it took me longer to write this readme than to
  design all the levels.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">There
  is one thing about this set that bothers me.&nbsp; Yeah, just one thing.&nbsp;
  My original intent was to re-name each level, which required some simple hex
  editing of the EXE.&nbsp; Then it hit me that I shouldn’t be distributing
  the EXE even if I am not including any of the other original game files.&nbsp;
  What this means is that some of the level design won’t quite correspond with
  the existing name of some of the levels.&nbsp; So be it.&nbsp; It isn’t a
  huge thing, but I apologize for not taking that into account earlier.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I
  believe in pacing oneself.&nbsp; I cannot stomach mods where every
  feature/item/texture/enemy is thrown at the player in the first couple of
  levels.&nbsp; Where is the build up?&nbsp; Where’s the anticipation (and why
  does that name ring a bell?)?&nbsp; You will notice the difficulty will build
  as you progress through the game, although every once in a while I will throw
  a level at you that is on the easier or harder side.&nbsp; Just trying to
  create balance through imbalance.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; So it goes…</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I
  have always loved creating interesting secret areas within a level.&nbsp;
  Sadly, with the cheat function it makes finding secrets impossibly easy
  (huh?).&nbsp; Don’t cheat (and save often!).&nbsp; Secret areas are not a
  huge deal in <i>BSE90</i>.&nbsp; Sure, you will find your usual
  health/ammo/treasure/switches/teleporters/etc., but not in abundance.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">If
  you have the original documentation that comes with the game then you might
  want to give it a little bit of a read through to help familiarize yourself
  with all the different aspects of the game.&nbsp; Especially comes in handy if
  you want to do some customizing to make playing smoother or for some technical
  stuff that might help your game experience run a little cleaner.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">For those of you in the Wolf3D community who are SDL-only
  addicts, please don't ask me if this set is available in SDL.&nbsp; It's
  not.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp; Nope, not in SDL.&nbsp;
  Nada.&nbsp; Ain't happening.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Another
  thing to mention is getting perfect percentiles.&nbsp; Hey… 50000 points is
  50000 points.&nbsp; There are a few levels that will not allow you 100%
  completion unless you teleport in from another level (I’m thinking those
  would be all secret levels leading back to normal levels, but I could be
  mistaken… actually I am frequently mistaken… usually for an adult).&nbsp;
  In most, if not all (hey… is this where we get the word ‘almost’ from?)
  you will see a door into an area that you haven’t been able to access
  (usually a one-way door).&nbsp; That’s not exactly a hint, but close enough.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Could
  the end be near?</span></font></p>

  <b><u>One final word...<br>
  </u></b><br>
  Do with these maps as you may.&nbsp; If you are a modder you have my full
  permission to use these maps as a base.&nbsp; I only ask that you do NOT give
  me credit in any way.&nbsp; If you can learn anything about mapping then all
  the better.&nbsp; I laugh at how some modders steal (oops! I mean borrow)
  stuff from mods, give no credit and go into a petulant frenzy (petulant
  frenzy!!! petulant frenzy!!!&nbsp; I MISS FRANK ZAPPA!) when someone uses
  their work without giving credit.&nbsp; I only preach two things.&nbsp; Learn
  and create.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;Once you have mastered
  those you can then foster (unless your idea of fostering is calling all newbie
  work 'crap' and in that case I fart in your general direction).<br>
  <br>
  That will be my final Monty Python reference.<br>
