This is a map I started before Blah and Gates were created.  I didn't really like 
the way it way going, so I did other maps instead.  I eventually finished the oldest 
map, and this is what I ended up with.  It borrows too many sequences from Blah and 
Gates to really be a legitamite entry, so here it is for anyone who's interested.


There are a few other maps included with this one that I'll comment on:

"Default Setting" - This is an update of AlumiuN's map that he made for people using 
the MMC development kit.  I just expanded it to demonstrate more of the features 
and how to use them;  it's nothing special.  Note the odd places in the map where 
undefined objects appear ... objects that the EXE doesn't do anything with.  This 
is where the 3-D Directional versions of the Glass and Spear Racks would've been 
... along with my 8 new treasure items.

"Choose A Side" - This is another "concept level" where the player finds two locked 
doors to the left, he teleports, gets the keys, opens one of two locked doors, and 
finds he's somehow made his way through the locked doors he saw earlier.  The teleport 
feature is used to create the illusion that the player is constantly going right, 
but somehow ends up on the left side of the map again.  I eventually lost interest 
in the map's layout in general.  I might do this map's concept from scratch in the 
future, but the map here is a no-go for me.

"Pac-man" - I was actually planning to make a 3-D Pac-man game with the Wolf3D engine. 
 The images were going to be 128x128 in size, and it was going to use a different 
I would create.  This map was as far as I got with the project, and as you can see, 
the gameplay wouldn't have worked very well.  It's included here for whatever it's 
worth.

Enjoy ...

Tricob.
