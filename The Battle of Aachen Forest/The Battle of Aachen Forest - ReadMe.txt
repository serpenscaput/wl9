Thank you for downloading The Battle of Aachen Forest.

This is my first Wolf3d mod and can only be played on Ecwolf.
I tried playing on DosBox but the new title screen I made crashed the game.
This game only has two levels one made by me and one by a friend of mine.
The mod also has new music.
The Story

The year is October 1, 1944 as the US First Army moves toward Aachen. You are assinged to a new mission.
According to American intelligence the Nazis are conducting strange experiments in the area.
Your mission is to navigate through the forest and see what the Nazis are up to.
If your mission is a success the Americans will be able to continue their attack on Aachen.
Good luck BJ.
