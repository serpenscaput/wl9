^C7eSECRET LEVEL 2: STASIS

		^C00Congratulations, you have found the second secret level!
		It looks like another lab sector. But this one is different from the others. The 
technology in this lab is more advanced than what you've witnessed so far.
		The death of Dr. Schabbs should have marked the end of the Eisenfaust threat. But 
somehow, the Nazis are still building an army of undead mutants and storing them 
here. Even worse, they may be developing more advanced types of mutants...
