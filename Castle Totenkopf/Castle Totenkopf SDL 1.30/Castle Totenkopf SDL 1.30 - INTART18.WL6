^C7eSECRET LEVEL 1: SPLINTERED CELLS

		^C00Congratulations, you have found the first secret level!
		It seems this prison is a lot bigger than you thought. You have found an older section which is still in use. For many years, political dissidents and prisoners of war have been left to rot in these cells. Hundreds have been tortured and died down here. The time has come to punish the ones responsible. But be careful... getting around this old dungeon is not as easy as it used to be!
