^C7eSECRET LEVEL 3: DEATH'S HEAD

		^C00Congratulations, you have found the third and final secret level!
		This cavern must be where the Nazis have hidden their failed experiments. And somewhere down here is a special kind of mutant... an abomination spawned from a horrific marriage of occult powers and twisted science. The Nazis had finally succeeded in creating a soldier that could never truly die. But it proved to be so destructive and uncontrollable that they had to lock it away and never let it out.
		And now you're trapped with it...
