^C7eSS CAPTAIN NARBENGESICHT ELIMINATED!

		^C00The Allies have one less Nazi interrogator to worry about, thanks to you. Captain Narbengesicht finally got what he deserved. He never showed his victims any mercy, so you gave him none in return.
		But something's not right... You expected dozens of more angry Nazi soldiers to deal with on the next floor. Instead, you find their corpses strewn everywhere. What the hell happened here?
