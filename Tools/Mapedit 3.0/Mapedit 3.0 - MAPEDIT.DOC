MapEdit - Wolfenstein Map Editor                       (c) 1992  Bill Kirby


To use MapEdit, copy all the files into the directory where you have Wolf3d
installed.  You may want to make backup copies of the MAPHEAD.WL1 and 
MAPTEMP.WL1 files.  Type MAPEDIT to start the editor.


Key funtions:

arrows - select level to view
   q,Q - quit (you will be prompted to save)
   c,C - clear level (grey brick around the outside of an empty level)
   o,O - toggle object display
   d,D - toggle decoration display
   m,M - toggle multiple brick type display


Map window:

Whenever the mouse is in the map window, the map and object data for the
selected square will be displayed beneath the window.  Clicking the mouse
will change either the map or object data to the currently selected item.


Legend window:

The window on the right side of the screen displays the map/object legend.
Clicking on UP/DOWN scrolls through the list.  Clicking on MAP/OBJ switches
between the map and object lists.  Clicking on an item in the list makes
it the "current" item.


Helpfull hints for creating levels:

 - Each level MUST have at least 1 secret door, 1 guard, and 1 treasure, or
   the game will hang when trying to compute the percentages.

 - The floor values (currently they don't appear as anything) determine the
   behavior of the guards.  If a guard is on a square with the floor value
   of 6a, it will not respond to anything.  If a guard is on a floor value
   other than 6a, it will respond to shots fired, so long as you are on a 
   floor of the same value as the guard.

 - The first four guards in each section are stationary.  The second four
   are moving guards.  They will walk through walls if you don't put 
   movement turning points (5a-61).  I haven't figured out how the movement
   turning points work yet.

 - It seems that a door between two rooms will not operate properly if the
   floor value is the same in both rooms.


MAPDATA.DEF and OBJDATA.DEF:

If you figure out a new object, you can add it's description to the
object/map list by editing the MAPDATA.DEF or OBJDATA.DEF file.
Each line in the file contains 3 items:

0000 0000 Objectname

The first four digits are HEX for the object number.  Right now, even
though their are 4 digits, you can only put objects from 0000-00ff in.

The second four digits define how the object will look in the map.
The first two digits are the primary/secondary colors.  The third
digit is the graphic type, and the fourth digit is the character
string to use if the graphic type is "text".

Colors:
   0 - black
   1 - blue
   2 - green
   3 - cyan
   4 - red
   5 - magenta
   6 - brown
   7 - light grey
   8 - dark grey
   9 - light blue
   a - light green
   b - light cyan
   c - light red
   d - light magenta
   e - yellow
   f - white

Graphic types:

   0 - text (uses fourth character of graphic definition)
   1 - solid box
   2 - checkered
   3 - solid box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   4 - checkered box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   5 - large filled circle (primary) with smaller circle (secondary)
   6 - horizontal bar
   7 - vertical bar
   8 - two color box (used for landscape view)
   9 - single pixel centered 
   a - 3x3 pixel block
   b - 3x5 pixel block
   c - 
   d - X (primary)
   e - rectangle
   f - arrow  (secondary color indicates direction: 0=n,1=ne,2=e,3=se,
                                                    4=s,5=sw,6=w,7=nw)
