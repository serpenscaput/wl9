This Map Editor for Rise of the Triad should ONLY be used to
create/edit levels for the registered version of the game. If you
have problems with any floors produced using MAPEDROT, do NOT
contact Apogee Software. They are not responsible for this editor
or its products. Nor do they support them. Please contact one of
the MapedRot authors if you have problems with MAPEDROT.

Also, if you produce floors that you place in the public domain, be
sure they carry a notice that users should not contact any of the
above named companies for help.

It is not unusual for "home-grown" floor designs to cause problems
when played. That is, a game engine may produce an  error message
if it finds something in the floor that it doesn't like. Most
messages from the game urge the player to contact Apogee Software
and report the problem. IGNORE all such messages and contact one of
the authors of MAPEDIT if you receive any of these error messages.

To avoid most problems, test all your floor designs thoroughly at
all skill levels. If possible, have a friend test them also if you
intend to release your designs into the public domain.

Your cooperation is essential for continued support and
availability of MAPEDROT. Thank you.

         -----------------------------------------------
           Be sure you have backup copies of your map

         -----------------------------------------------
         !!!  IMPORTANT  WARNING  !!!  IMPORTANT WARNING

MapEdRot has been setup to operate from a sub-directory of Rise of The
Triad.  We recommend that you create a sub-directory named MAPEDROT
and unzip the files in PROGRAM.ZIP into it.  That is all you will have
to do.  If you don't install it into a sub-directory of ROTT you will
have to change the "Game path" parameter in the "Pref" menu.  Once you
have changed this you should save it by selecting "Save Pref" also in
the "Pref" menu.

NOTE:  MAPEDROT will ONLY execute in a pure DOS environment.  It will
NOT operate from within Windows, including WINDOWS 95.  Exception:  If
you select SHUTDOWN in Win95 and elect to "Restart the Computer in
MS-DOS mode", MapEdRot will operate in this manner.  We are using a
freeware DOS extender.  There is a new version expected soon that will
support running in Windows 3.x and Windows 95.

BASIC MAPEDIT REQUIREMENTS

The system requirements for running MapEdRot are generally the same
as for playing the game, in terms of the amount of memory required
and the environment, which is pure DOS. However, MapEdRot will NOT
execute from within Windows.

During editing, MapEdRot will use up to 500K of hard disk space for
temporary files.

MapEdRot uses a number of files. These are listed below. All of
these files should be placed in a directory other than the one
where the game files reside. You will need to inform MapEdRot where
the game's files are located. Use the MAPEDIT.INI file for this.

MAPEDROT.EXE (map editor program)

Data Definition Files

MAPDATA.ROT
OBJDATA.ROT
INFODATA.ROT

The above 3 files are used to equate the numeric codes within
the game's Map files to graphic symbols for MAPEDROT to display in
the Map window. It is recommended that you do NOT modify these
files. If you do, then make backup copies before you make any
changes. See HELP in the editor for an explanation of the codes in
these files.

MAPEDIT.INI (holds user Preferences)

<anyname>.HHH (help files)

<*>.FNT (font files)

PALETTE.DEF (color palette)

TITLE.BMP (color graphic title screen)

GO32.EXE  (provides 32-bit processing)

<*>.SAV (temporary files - may be erased at any time)

Game Files

MapEdRot works with 3 of the Rise of the Triad game files:

*.RTL (levels for single player)
*.RTC (levels for death match and modem play)
*.WAD (game graphics)

GAME FILES vs. LEVELS

During editing, floors can be exchanged with one another, or
replaced with other imported floors. Individual floors can also be
exported to the hard disk - this is a COPY operation as the
original floor being exported is not erased. When a copy of a floor
is exported to hard disk it becomes independent of the original map
file. An exported level cannot be edited or viewed again until it
is imported to an existing game map file.

Existing floors can be imported to a Current level in MapEdRot
using the Import command for placement on any existing level within
the game being edited. This causes the original floor on the target
level to be overlaid.

When you finish editing and are ready to quit MapEdRot, you will be
prompted for whether you want to save any changes made during the
edit operation. If you reply YES, all floors on all levels are
rewritten to the game's map file. This replaces the original copy
of the map file on disk.

Saving is not the same as exporting individual floors; Saving saves
all floors into one file; Exporting creates a single file
consisting of one floor only.

HELP

Help while running MapEdRot is available online by pressing either
F1 or Clicking on the Help button in the Menu Bar.

                   *********IMPORTANT*********

Much of what you need to know about running MAPEDROT and about
designing levels for Rise of the Triad is contained in the HELP
text. Be sure to review it as needed.

It is also strongly recommended that you carefully study some of
the levels in the registered version of Rise of the Triad. Most
anything you want to do has been done in the official game levels.

Loading MAPEDROT

Upon loading MAPEDROT (by typing MAPEDROT on the DOS command line),
you will first view an opening announcement. Press Enter and you
will see a screen asking you to select a screen resolution. The
highest resolution (1024x768) provides the smoothest texture. You
must select one of the 3 resolutions. There is no default at the
present time. The next screen will be the Title graphic. Press
Enter once more and the editor screen will appear.  When this is
complete, the screen will display the 1st floor in the first
episode.

Choosing a Game File to Edit

To edit a game file other than the default (DARKWAR.RTL), you can
supply the name of an existing game file by entering its name as a
parameter on the command line when you invoke MapEdRot. The game
file you choose must be in the directory pointed to by the
MAPEDIT.INI file. You will set this up in the Preferences section
of the editor.

Example: mapedrot <name>.rtl

Alternatively, after you load MapEdRot, you can pull down the File
Menu and open the file of your choice from there.

Getting Started

After the Map Editor is loaded the first time, you should
familiarize yourself with the layout of the screen (described
below) and immediately select 'Pref' from the Menu bar in order to
pull down the Pref menu. From here you can choose among several
options. One of the first options you will probably want to select
is the location of the game files. After you make a selection, be
sure to Save your changes.

Map Window Details

A floor map is 128 by 128 squares (or cells), and as stated above,
the map consists of 3 basic ingredients: Map data (floors, walls,
and doors), Object data (almost everything else), and LHV or
INFODATA (special hex values). All types of data can be displayed
independently or all at once.

By default, the floor codes are not visible when the editor is
first loaded. (The default can be changed by use of the optional
MAPEDIT.INI file - see below). In order to see them, you press the
'F' hot-key which will toggle them on the screen. Since floor codes
and object codes often exist together, you may want to turn off the
object codes when viewing the floor codes. You can toggle the
Object codes off by pressing the 'O' hot-key. (Walls and doors
normally remain visible on the screen).

Mouse Use in the Map Window

Since there are at least 2 buttons on every mouse, you can use the
left and right buttons to hold 2 different item codes for each of
the 3 different Edit modes you are currently in - Object, Map, or
LHV. As indicated above, both button values are displayed just
beneath the Item List Window.

Selecting a Definition For Either Mouse Button

There are 2 ways to select a data definition for a mouse button.
You can either move the mouse over to the Item List window and
point to the symbol you want to select and click a mouse button, or
you can point to an object, map, or LHV symbol in the Map window,
hold down a Shift key and click a mouse button to pick up the
desired item. You must be in EDIT mode (cursor is a pencil) to
select an item from the Map Window.

Inserting an Item on the Map

After assigning an item to either mouse button, move the mouse to
the location on the map where you want the item to be inserted,
make sure you are in EDIT mode and click the appropriate mouse
button to place the item on the map. This has the effect of erasing
any object currently at the chosen location and inserting a new one
in its place.

Erasing an Item from the Map

To erase (remove) an item anywhere on the map, select the
appropriate "No Map Item, No Object Item, or No LHV Item from the
Item List Window and insert it in the Map Window where you want to
erase an item (or items).

Clearing the Map Window

When starting a fresh design, it is often desireable to clear out
the current floor design. You do this by pulling down the Edit menu
from the Menu Bar and selecting "neW level". Only locations 0,0
thru 0,3 will contain their former codes.

Drawing Mode - Freehand

The mouse can be used to draw figures in the Map window in
freehand. To draw freehand, simply hold down the chosen mouse
button and "drag" the mouse in the direction you wish to go. This
works in all 3 map modes.

NOTE: Previously placed objects will remain in their original
positions, so be careful not to end up with guards embedded in
walls.

The mouse can also be used to draw straight lines of map data that
you want replicated. Just select the item with either mouse button.
Position the mouse in the Map window where you want to start
replicating the item and hold the appropriate button down while
dragging the mouse vertically or horizontally.

Item List Window

To change Edit Modes, press the Space Bar. To scroll vertically,
one screen full at a time, move the cursor to the Item List Window
and use the PgUp/PgDn keys. Use the up/down arrow keys to scroll
one item at a time. Use the Home and End keys to get to the top and
bottom respectively.  Use the left/right arrows to scroll
horizontally. Pressing HOME, END, or Space will return the window
to the far left.

Toggle Keys

     F - Toggle floor codes display on/off
     H - Toggle HEX mode on/off
     L - Toggle LHV display on/off
     O - Toggle objects on/off
 Alt+S - Display count of items in Item List Window
<Space>- Toggles round robin among Object, Map, and LHV list items.

NOTE: Initial "toggle" settings are controlled by MAPEDIT.INI file.

F Toggle (Toggle Floor data On and Off)

Pressing the 'F' key will toggle the floor code display on and off
in the Map Window. The default setting is set by MAPEDIT.INI.

H Toggle (Toggle Hex Mode on/off)

Use the 'H' key to cause data in the Information Window Center
Panel to be displayed in hex or to toggle off the hex values and
display values in decimal. The default setting for this is
controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

L Toggle (Toggle LHV Display)

The 'L' key toggles the LHV display graphics (green square with
green cross inside) on/off. Having them toggled on will show where
the LHV codes are. Toggling them off will display what is
underneath the LHV codes. The default setting for this is
controlled by MAPEDIT.INI.

O Toggle (Toggle Object Data On/Off)

Use the 'O' key to toggle Object data on and off. This operation is
similar to the 'F' key above which toggles Floor codes on and off.
It is often useful to have Object data removed from the Map Window
when examining floor codes. The default setting for this toggle
action is controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

Alt+S Toggle (Display Count of Items in Legend Window)

Pressing Alt+S will toggle on and off a display of the count of the
individual items listed in the Item List Window. The default
setting for Alt+S is controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

Spacebar Toggle (Toggle between Map, Object, and LHV Item Lists)

Pressing the Spacebar will toggle the Item List window to display
either Map data, Object data, LHV Item data, the effect of which is
to change Edit modes between Map, Object, and LHV data.

Scrolling Keys

<pgup/pgdn>          - Pages Item List up/down (cursor in Item List
                       Window
<up/down arrows>     - Scrolls Item list up or down one line at a
                       time.
<left/rt arrows>     - Scroll legend horizontally one column
<Ctrl+lft/rt arrows> - Scroll legend horiz. 10 columns
<Home/End>           - Top/Bottom of Legend
<Pgup/Pgdn>          - Select level to view (cursor in Map Window)

Statistics

The statistics display, which is toggled on and off using the 'S'
hot-key, keeps track of the following information:

     Walls
     Doors
     Static Objects
     Low Guards
     High Guards
     BOSSes
     Weapons
     Push Walls

Besides the statistics displayed above, there are more available in
each Legend window by using the Alt+S key. When this key
combination is pressed, the count of any items presently displayed
in the Item List window that exist in the current Map window will
be displayed to the right of each item in the Legend window. The
item counts can be toggled off by using Alt+S again. This feature
can be quite useful when you are attempting to determine whether a
particular object or map code is used in any given level. Any value
other than zero means the code is being used.

MAPEDIT.INI file

An optional file included in the MAPEDIT package is a MAPEDIT.INI
file. This file can be used to change defaults that are used by the
editor.

The file currently contains 12 variables that can be edited with
any Ascii editor. Below are the variable names and their default
values.
                                       Default
show_objects=true/false                 true

show_large_hex=true/false               true
hexvals=true/false                      false
item_hex_codes=true/false               false
mapitems_with_onlyobject=true/false     (not used)

Directory containing game files.
Path to read/write floor files.

The MAPEDIT.INI file included is a sample of how these variables
are coded. You can use the sample file by changing the definitions
to suit your needs.

To expand a bit on a couple of the variables in the list above,
"game_path" can be used to define the name and location of the
directory where the ROTT game files are located, if not in the
current directory.

All 3 data definition (.ROT) files must reside in the same
directory as MAPEDROT.
