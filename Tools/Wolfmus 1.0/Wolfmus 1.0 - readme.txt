Wolf3d Music Player 1.0 - by Martin Fernandez
-----------------------------------------

	This is a new music player, designed to play the original
'Wolfenstein 3D' and 'Spear of Destiny' tracks. All of them are included (I ripped 
them from the audio file), so any secret tunes
are there too. This is freeware, so do what you want with it.

Requirements and OS info:
------------------------
	You need an Adlib card or any Adlib-compatible one (all SoundBlaster's should work), 
just like in the game. Right now, it 
doesn't check or auto-detect it, but that shouldn't be a problem.
It will run in DOS or in a DOS window under Win9x. If Windows asks
you to run it in MS-DOS only mode, you can answer 'No' and it should
still work fine. Note that when you leave the player in the background,
the sound will freeze until you switch to it again (just like the
game does).


Installation:
------------
	Remember to unzip all the files to the same directory, and to
check your MIDI volume settings if no sound comes when you run it. 
Once you execute it, just use the keys listed on the screen. Any other
will exit the program.


Misc. info:
----------
	You can switch from song to song in a linear order, turn on/off
each of the nine voices and speed up/slow down the tempo. The first 27
tracks are all the 'Wolf' ones, and the rest are tunes that appear 
only on 'Spear of Destiny' (which are marked with a [SPEAR] sign).
The titles were taken from the hidden jukebox of the game, or from
the filenames if the song was not listed in the jukebox.
