This is Wolfmap 1.60. It processes Wolf3D version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 map files.
It is distributed as freeware, but only for NON-COMMERCIAL use.

The archive you received should contain the following files:

wolfmap.exe     The program.
wolfmap.doc     Documentation for the program.
wolfmap.h       Header file for the sources.
wolfmap.c       Source file containing the main program.
wgraph.c        Source file containing the editor.
wglobal.c       Source file containing support functions.
wgamemap.c      Source file containing support functions.
wmapdata.c      Source file containing support functions.
wsup.c          Source file containing support functions.
egavga.bgi      Graphics driver for the buildin map editor.
mapdata.def     Definitions for the currently known map values.
objdata.def     Definitions for the currently known object values.
readme          This text.

The source files are provided so you can make modifications to the program,
but they are distributed as is. The source files are copyrighted by Sysma
Automatisering, and so will be all the changes you make to any of the
supplied sources. You may redistribute your modifications, but ALL origional
files MUST be included, including this disclaimer. Also, you may only
distribute these files or your own modifications without charging any money
or any other form of compensation.

The sources are origionally written using the Borland C++ (tm) compiler, but
should (re)compile without any problems using another C++ compiler. Note
that you cannot use a normal C compiler, as this program makes heavily use of
the class extentions defined only for C++ 2.0 or higher.

The program itself is using i286 specific instructions, so it cannot be run
on XT hardware. Normally, this should not cause any problems, since the same
holds true for WOLF3D itself. The program is developed using OS/2 2.0 (tm)
as the development platform, but should run normally on any DOS version of
3.0 or higher.
