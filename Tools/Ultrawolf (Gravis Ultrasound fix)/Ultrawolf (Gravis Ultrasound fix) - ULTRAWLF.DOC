Note for Distributors
---------------------

UltraWolf may be freely distributed (PD). It may and shall be copied via
bulletin board systems, diskettes or other media without any restrictions.
In other words:

                           SPREAD IT or LEAVE IT :)



READ THIS MANUAL FIRST!
-----------------------

If you have any devices that may conflict with the standard Ultrasound
settings then read the manual completely! I will not feel responsible for any
data loss you may encounter due to the use of this program!



What is UltraWolf?
------------------

If you like Wolfenstein3D and are not too impressed by that (IMHO f*cking)
SB, SBPro, SBPro++, SBPro16ý (ahem) and compatible cards, you will (hopefully)
love the UltraWolf package: It will redirect Wolfenstein's digital audio
output (say: samples) to your Ultrasound card. (Sounds not too exciting, eh?
But there's more: ) Using the UltraWolf software, you will be able to hear up
to 14 screams, eh, samples ;) at the same time. That means, you will no longer
be forced to release the trigger when shooting that bad guy >:-> You will also
be able to make out the distance and location of your enemies. Furthermore,
you can modify any of the samples to your like. And as if that is not enough,
you can listen to your favourite mods during gameplay. UltraWolf uses your
Ultrasound card's capabilities directly, that means you won't need SBOS or
similar drivers.



Memory requirements
-------------------
So far, UltraWolf needs about 80k of memory (16k program, 64k songbuffer).
The songbuffer will not be allocated when disabling the modplayer (opt /DM).



Installing UltraWolf
--------------------

First of all you should enter Wolfenstein and disable all sound output in
the options menu. I don't know if this is necessary but you may encounter
problems if you have any other soundcard besides the Ultrasound installed.
Copy all UltraWolf files to your Wolfenstein directory or create a new dir
where you put all UltraWolf files (see 'commandline parameters'). The files
UWINS1.EXE and UWINS16.EXE should reside in your Wolfenstein3D directory
(they can be deleted later on). I also suggest that you put ULTRAWLF.EXE in
your Wolf3D directory. Make a backup of your WOLF.EXE or WOLF3D.EXE files
since once they have been patched they will only run in conjunction with
UltraWolf. If you have the shareware game then run UWINS1.EXE (you may have
to rename WOLF3D.EXE to WOLF.EXE first), if you have the commercial version
1.1 (hope you paid for your copy) run UWINS16.EXE.

UWINS will patch the WOLF (shareware) or WOLF3D (commercial) executables to
make them work with the UltraWolf device. I have tested UltraWolf with the
shareware version 1.0 and the commercial version 1.1 (parts 1-6), and it's
highly unlikely that UltraWolf will run with other versions. If your version
is not compatible with UltraWolf try to get the shareware version 1.0.

Once UWINS has patched your Wolfenstein copy you may delete the UWINS*.EXE
files. From now on, every time you want to play Wolfenstein3D you'll have to
install the memory resident UltraWolf driver first. The batchfile GO.BAT will
do that for you but you may have to modify it first. UltraWolf will not check
the DOS environment variables so if you don't want UltraWolf to use the
standard Irq (11) you must tell UltraWolf which interrupt to use. In addition,
you may have to tell UltraWolf where to search for the sound files.

If all UltraWolf files reside in your Wolfenstein3D directory and your
Ultrasound card configuration is standard you may run GO.BAT now. If not,
read on and change the batchfile to suit your needs.



Commandline parameters
----------------------

There are a few options you can give UltraWolf on the way:

/Bn	-> n indicates the baseportaddress of your Ultrasound card. You can
	   use this option if your computer locks up when executing UltraWolf.
	   Valid values for n are: 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260.

/In	-> n indicates the Ultrasound interrupt you want UltraWolf to use.
	   The default IRQ is 11.
	   Valid values for n are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 12, 15.

/DS	-> disable sound fx. This way you get a chance of checking out the
           modplayer even if your card has only the standard amount of 256K
           onboard memory.

/DM	-> disable modplayer.

PATH	-> a commandline parameter not beginning with '/' will be interpreted
	   as a path to an UltraWolf directory. UltraWolf will search all the
	   needed files in the indicated directory instead of the current
	   directory.

Calling ULTRAWLF when installed already will remove it from memory.



Modifying samples
-----------------

Included with this package are a number of files which end with .SND. These
are (did you think?) the samples that are cached to the GUS-DRAM by UltraWolf
The samples have been ripped from the VSWAP.WL? data file and, to make them
fit into 256K, some of them have been slightly modified (I haven't figured out
yet how to rip them automatically). If your card's onboard memory has been
extended you may use larger samples, of course. To use your own samples simply
copy them over the corresponding WOLF??.SND files (see below) and change the
frequency and basevolume for these samples in the UWOLFSMP.INF file.

The UWOLFSMP.INF file may look like this:

------------------------------------ BoF --------------------------------------
8000, 65535		; WOLF00.SND - 'halt stop'
8000, 65535		; WOLF01.SND - 'achtung'
4000, 30000		; WOLF02.SND - 'swinehunt'
...
8000, 20000		; WOLF2D.SND - 'mein leben!'
------------------------------------ EoF --------------------------------------


Explanation:


8000, 65535		; WOLF2D.SND - 'mein leben!'

^     ^			^
|     |			|
|     |			+--- this character indicates that a comment is
|     |			     following (optional)
|     |
|     +--------------------- (decimal) basevolume for the sample. The sample
|			     will be played with this volume when the player's
|			     location is equal to the sound source.
|
+--------------------------- (decimal) sample frequency


The infofile must contain 46 entries like the above.

If you i.e. wanted to change the third sample you would have to copy your
sample over WOLF02.SND (counting from 00) and then change the parameters in
the third line of the info file. Note that if you wanted to change the 11th
sample you would have to overwrite WOLF0A.SND, not WOLF10.SND, but you already
knew that, right? BTW: There may be no empty lines or pure comment lines in
the info file.

Note: The samples are stored as raw unsigned 8-bit data. You can directly use
samples you recorded with USS8.



How to install your personal combat tunes
-----------------------------------------

If you have extended your GUS' onboard memory to at least 512KB then you can
listen to your favourite MODs during gameplay. Just like the UWOLFSMP.INF
infofile you can easily manipulate the UWOLFMOD.INF info file.

The UWOLFMOD.INF file may look like this:

------------------------------------ BoF --------------------------------------
nowwhat3.mod,	40,	 3,12,12, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7		; Levels 1.1 & 4.1
covergir.mod,	30,	 3,12,12, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7		; Hiscore
...
------------------------------------ EoF --------------------------------------


Explanation:

nowwhat3.mod,	40,	 3,12,12, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7		; levels 1.1 & 4.1

^		 ^	 ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 	^
|		 |	 |  |  |  |  |	|  |  |		|
|		 |	 |  |  |  |  |	|  |  |	 	+- comment following
|		 |	 |  |  |  |  |	|  |  |		   (optional)
|		 |	 |  |  |  |  |	|  |  |
|		 |	 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+----------- (decimal) pan
|		 |				   	   positions for
|		 |					   channels 1 to 8
|		 |
|		 +---------------------------------------- (decimal) song's
|							   mastervolume
|							   percentage
|
+--------------------------------------------------------- filename of your
							   favourite MOD


The infofile must contain 28 lines like the above describing 28 different (or
not) songs. So far as I know only 25 or 26 of them will be played, but I'm not
sure about this.

The modplayer is not perfect but supports most of the commonly used Protracker
functions and 4-8 channels mods (M.K., FLT4, ?FLT8, 6CHN, ?8CHN, ?M!K!). It's
also able to play UltraTracker(1.3) songs (limits: 64k songsize; 8 bit samples
only; up to 10 channels).

(? = not tested)

Unimplemented functions so far:

- All functions that affect the finetuning of samples are ignored.
- Inverted loop
- samples > 64K
- all UltraTracker-specific commands except balance sweeping

However, the player does quite well with the all mods I've tested it with
(now what 3, space debris, human target, umgah, comandr, bloood ...), although
vibrato & tremolo sound a bit distorted... underworld sounds a bit funny, too.



Aaaarrrggh... that shitty little program doesn't work!
------------------------------------------------------

Q:	When I run Wolfenstein3D there's only silence.
A:	- Have you patched the WOLF/WOLF3D executables? (Silly question but
	  there are people who don't RTFM...). If not do it now.
	- Your copy of Wolfenstein3D may not be compatible. Better don't run
	  the patched game anymore, strange things may happen. Try to get the
	  shareware version 1.0 for now. Future versions of UltraWolf (if any)
	  may support your version of Wolfenstein.
	- It may be due to a bug (see below). Simply uninstall UltraWolf and
	  run it again.

Q:	When I run Wolfenstein3D I hear only noise.
A:	- If you have loaded SBOS, MEGAEM or any other resident programs that
	  deal with the Ultrasound card -> throw them out!

Q:	Wolfenstein locks up as soon as it's started.
A:	- Try using the command line parameters for setting the Ultrasound
	  baseport and irq. UltraWolf won't check the DOS environment vars.
	- If that fails, your copy of Wolfenstein3D may not be compatible with
	  UltraWolf. Again, try to get the shareware version 1.0.
	- If you have the shareware version 1.0 then maybe someone has tampered
	  with it. Try to get a clean copy without trainer and such stuff.

Q:	My Ultrasound card has more than 256K of onboard memory but none of
	the mods will be played.
A:	- Check the path you've started UltraWolf with. If you i.e. started
	  UltraWolf in it's own directory without a pathstatement and then
	  switched to the Wolf3D directory, UltraWolf won't be able to locate
	  the mods you're refering to. Specify a full path to your UltraWolf
	  directory in that case.
	- If also no sound effects are played it may be due to a bug (see
	  below). Simply uninstall UltraWolf and run it again.

Q:	A particular mod won't be played.
A:	- Check the UWOLFMOD.INF infofile for spelling of filenames. The
	  suffix (.MOD or whatsoever) must be appended to the filename.	The
	  filename may not consist of a path plus a filename. Also check the
	  mastervolume setings.
	- The modfile is not one UltraWolf recognizes. Try any other.



Known bugs
----------

- Some samples (attacking dogs, elevator) will not be played in the shareware
  version.
- not yet clickfree (SHAME!ý) but I'm working on it.



Fixed bugs
----------

Version 1.2
- version 1.1 enabled irq11 whenever the sampleupdateroutine was called. This
  may have caused trouble on some machines.
- haven't had the 'silence'-bug for a long time now. It seems the irq-handler
  is now initialized correctly.
- removed some clicks (Underworld sounds a bit better now...)
- tremolo & vibrato fixed (hope so)
- arpeggio fixed (subtracted halfnotes ;)
- delay_note & retrig_note fixed (missed 1 VB)

Version 1.3
- volslide fixed (A11 slides up now)
- set_sampleoffset fixed (didn't check boundaries)

Version 1.31
- fixed nasty nasty nasty bug... UltraWolf hanged when entering levels 2 or 6.
  should work now.



Extensions
---------

Version 1.2
- implemented the set_bpm command
- accepts UltraTracker modules now
- effect E8x (0-F) sets the pan position of a voice



What else?
----------

Hope I didn't forget anything. Thanks and greetings go to:

- Renaissance for the UltraDox (and great PC demos of course)

- Gravis & Forte for creating the best PC-soundcard at a fair price.
  (Got a priceless daughterboard left? ;)

- ID & Apogee for the technically best PC-Game I've ever seen (Wolfenstein3D
  was the reason why I bought my 386)

- All groups and programmers who support the GUS



Hope you enjoy my little hack. Now go and GET PSYCHED! And watch your back!
