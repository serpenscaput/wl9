WolfenMap v5.0 - Wolfenstein Map Editor                 (c) 1993 L. Shanker


Please register your copies of Wolfenstein 3D with Apogee Software.  It is
assumed that owners of "Spear of Destiny" have purchased their software
from FormGen.

WolfenMap v5.0 is disabled and can only edit the first two floors of a
given game.  It is being made available on an evaluation basis.  Please use
the REGISTER.DOC included in this version of MapEdit to receive the
full-featured version of WolfenMap.  Registered users will receive the newest
version of WolfenMap as well as the next release, when it becomes available.
Planned features for a future release include: cut and paste within a level,
cut and paste between levels, extract a level from a map to a separate file,
inclusion of a separate level file into an episode file.  These enhances will
only be made if there is sufficient support of the existing version.  Now
here's the sob-story: there's no incentive to program without monetary rewards.

WolfenMap is similar to MapEdit except it greatly reduces map development
time through the following enhancements:

  - Flood an entire map with a user-selected wall.  (It's much quicker to
    cut floors into a solid wall than it is to draw walls around a floor.)

  - Instantly add blocks of walls, floors or objects. (This eases the
    tediousness of correcting mouse mistakes.)
          

To use WolfenMap, unpack the archive into the directory where your game
is installed.  Type: WM50 to start the editor.

Key funtions:

     up & down arrows - select level to view or edit.
     Q - Quit (you will be prompted to save).
     C - Clear level (grey brick around the outside of an empty level).
     O - Toggle object display.
     F - Toggle floor display.
     W - Flood an entire level with the last chosen wall, floor or object.
     G - Display a count of things, actors and static objects.
     2 through 9 - Instantly paste the current wall, floor or object in
         block fashion by positioning the mouse at the top left corner of
         the block, then pressing a number key.

Map window:

Whenever the mouse is in the map window, the map and object data for the
selected square will be displayed beneath the window.  Clicking the mouse
will change either the map or object data to the currently selected item.


Legend window:

The window on the right side of the screen displays the map/object legend.
Clicking on UP/DOWN scrolls through the list.  Clicking on MAP/OBJ switches
between the map and object lists.  Clicking on an item in the list makes
it the "current" item.

After each guard, there is a 3 character description which specifies
what level the guard is, whether they are moving or stationary, and
what direction they are facing/walking.  For example, "1/S/E" means 
a level 1 guard, stationary, facing east.


WALLS.DAT, WALLSOD.DAT, THINGS.DAT and THINGSOD.DAT:

If you figure out a new object or desire to customize WolfenMap, you can
add or change it's description to the object/map list by editing the
appropriate DAT file.

Each line in the file contains 3 items:

0000 0000 Objectname

The first four digits are HEX for the object number.  Right now, even
though there are 4 digits, you can only put objects from 0000-01ff in.

The second four digits define how the object will look in the map.
The first two digits are the primary/secondary colors.  The third
digit is the graphic type, and the fourth digit is the character
string to use if the graphic type is "text".

Colors:
   0 - black
   1 - blue
   2 - green
   3 - cyan
   4 - red
   5 - magenta
   6 - brown
   7 - light grey
   8 - dark grey
   9 - light blue
   a - light green
   b - light cyan
   c - light red
   d - light magenta
   e - yellow
   f - white

Graphic types:

   0 - text (uses fourth character of graphic definition)
   1 - solid box
   2 - checkered
   3 - solid box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   4 - checkered box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   5 - large filled circle (primary) with smaller circle (secondary)
   6 - horizontal bar
   7 - vertical bar
   8 - two color box (used for landscape view)
   9 - single pixel centered

   b - 3x5 pixel block
   c - 
   d - X (primary)
   e - rectangle
   f - arrow  (secondary color indicates direction: 0=n,1=ne,2=e,3=se,
                                                    4=s,5=sw,6=w,7=nw)
