Wolfer Spotlight
Luke Strauman

 
Luke Strauman's first mod "Operation Buzz Bomb" caught some flak for
resembling Nate Smith's "Beyond Wolfenstein 2 SE", and some wolfers thought
that Luke was just another rip-off artist. However, time proved these
sceptics wrong, for subsequent add-ons showed Luke to be a talented
programmer with some interesting ideas. "Project Esiam", for example, was
the first mod I remember seeing that had breakable objects. And "Sorcerer's
Wrath" was quite a departure from the original Wolf 3D, although only a
one-level demo.
 

"Buzz Bomb" itself eventually placed 4th in an early 2000 poll on Mr. Lowe's
web site, behind "Totengraeber", "Beyond Wolfenstein 2 SE", and "Western
Wall I" - pretty good company! Nowadays it maintains a positive presence on
the DHW top ten charts, and usually above "Western Wall I".
 

Luke seems to have drifted away from /lost interest in Wolf modding.
"Sorcerer's Wrath" was never returned to, despite its great promise;
"Area 51" was never truly completed, but left "as is" and declared finished;
but most frustratingly, Luke has released manuals for a couple of promising
mods, "Operation: Arctic Wolf" (a port of a WolfenDOOM scenario by Laz Rojas)
and "The Rise of Nod", but the mods themselves have never materialized. No
clues as to their whereabouts have ever been given, not even on Luke's own
website, <Wolf 3D Heaven And Hell>.
 

Luke, you're leaving us hanging!
