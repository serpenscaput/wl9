Ian Summerfield (Little Cherub)
 

Ian Summerfield, aka Little Cherub, has created Wolfenstein add-ons that
lean towards the "fun" side, several of them being cartoon-based. With "Crash
Bandicoot", he has developed his craft to the point of winning the May 2006
Dome Award.
 

Ian's first effort, "Monkeystein", was memorable for its screeching monkeys.
Very funny at first, but I would waste a lot of ammo soon thereafter, trying
to silence the monkeys in their death throes.
 

"Southern Hell" was made with the Spear Resurrection "Editor's" version and
featured characters and popular phrases from the cartoon South Park.
 

"Coldfusion!" and "Spear Resurrection Master Levels" were a respite from
the cartoon mods. For me, a very memorable item here was the wild pig in
"Coldfusion!" that squealed, noisily munched on you, then burst and melted
when you killed it.
 

"SpongeBobStein" was a Spear add-on that featured the characters from
"SpongeBob SquarePants". It contains many humorous digitized sounds from the
show, and almost wasn't released due to copyright concerns.
 

The next four mods were another break from cartoon modding and focused mostly
on a DOOM theme. "Nazi Party" was a shareware add-on without Nazis in it, but
mostly monsters. Spear add-on "Schabbs, An Evil Lunatic" had an interesting
enemy, the Stalker, which was a serpent that seemed to swim in the floor,
until it arose to shoot at you! "The DOOM Spear Demo" was a collaboration
with Mega Luigi, and "DOOM Universal Tour" utilized the "Beyond Mutantstein
SE" engine.
 

"Invasion of the Cartoons" was a return to cartoon modding. With quite an
array of different enemies and wall designs, it was Ian's first mod with
changed music, and used the "DOOM Spear Demo" engine.
 

When I started playing "Crash Bandicoot", I thought, "Oh, those noisy monkeys
again!" But this time instead of screeching monkeys in a Spear Resurrection
world, the whole environment was one in which these more "pleasant" monkeys
seemed right at home. Every detail was attended to: all new music, EXE and
VGA changes, and the top and bottom of the walls have been blended with the
ceilings and floors. "Crash Bandicoot 2" continued this excellent formula in
a Spear format.
