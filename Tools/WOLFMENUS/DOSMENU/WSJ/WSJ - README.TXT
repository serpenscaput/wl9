Wolf Skevos-Jones

 
Wolf Skevos-Jones has made add-ons of consistently high quality, winning
Dome Awards for every full game he has released. Only the Weapons of
Vengeance demo didn't win one, and likely it's because it's merely a 5-level
demo; it has the impressive code enhancements, graphics & sound changes, and
level design of all his other mods. 
 

Some of the more outstanding features of Wolf's add-ons are the sounds. His
guards have quite distinctive voices, whether they are calling you out or
dying. Also, WSJ has dropped in some ambient sounds, like the screams of
torture in Castle Totenkopf or the aircraft sounds in Project Eisenritter,
to cite two examples.
 

Wolf Skevos-Jones has contributed source code work to at least a half dozen
mods of others, and particularly those of his younger brother Ian. Most of
these have also won Dome Awards.
 

Wolf tends to keep a very low profile, never hyping his upcoming mods; I
imagine there's less pressure on him, and when he does release something,
it's a pleasant surprise to the Wolfenstein community, particularly since
his add-ons are top-notch and interesting to play. And you know WSJ's mods
are popular because there are so many "homages" and imitations of them.
Remember, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!
