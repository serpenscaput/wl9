Paal Olstad

 
Nicknamed "Poet", Paal Olstad has created Wolf 3D mods which are extremely
challenging and require a lot of problem-solving ability; his level designs
are very distinctive. Fortunately for many of us, he has also released
detailed hint manuals for his add-ons.
 

Paal's early releases were tough, but once he started making his own EXEs
with "Wolf Hour", he turned it up a notch: now there were 4 keys and poison
pools to deal with. He has since added customized EXE files to his first 3
add-ons, making "Wolf-Extra" into a special version and adding the unused
levels to episodes 2 and 3 of "Enemy Around the Corner". Thus made redundant:
Wolf-Extra (11/07/99) updated 09/14/00, now discontinued.
 

Paal's biggest release is "The Tower", winner of the first Dome Award in
January 2002. It features 4 keys, pools of poison, deadly purple chalices
and crosses that protect you from them, teleporters, explodable barrels,
bombs, and a missile launcher!
 

All the latest versions and hint manuals are available at the excellent
<Poet's Wolfenstein Page>, winner of the Spear of Destiny Fan Club's "Spear
of Excellence Award", amongst others. The site also features Paal's source
code tutorials and level design tips, a poll on his add-ons, and more.
 

Looking forward to Wolf-Extra III!

 

Andy Nonymous.
