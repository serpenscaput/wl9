
Wolfer Spotlight
Brian E. Lowe


In the Wolfenstein community, mention "Schabbs" and everyone knows you're
talking about Brian Lowe. Author of the "Wolfbel" series of levels and the
recently released "Revival of Memories", he is the glue that has held the
Wolf 3-D community together these past 8 years.
 

Brian is a dedicated die-hard Wolfer if there ever was one. Doing the
research for this article, I could see just how many Wolfenstein mods he
has affected in a positive way, by beta-testing, giving support and advice,
making bug-fixes, and creating levels for others' projects. In fact, you can
find more than 3 dozen unique Brian Lowe levels in addons other than his own,
if you know where to look for them. I have listed what I could find below.
 

From his first "Wolfbel" set released in 1998 to the brand-new "Revival of
Memories", Brian's designs tend to be well laid-out, nicely decorated, and
packed with action. Play them on "death incarnate" mode, and you'll get quite
a challenging workout!
 

Perhaps Brian's biggest contribution to our community is hosting virtually
all of the Wolf addons and TC's in existence on his two excellent web sites,
<Mr. Lowe's Wolf 3-D Page> (aka "Brian's Yellow Site"), and <The Wolf 3D Dome>.
He faithfully keeps the community up-to-date via the Dome news page, where he
also posts links to all the new releases.
 

All I can add to that is: Thanks Brian!
