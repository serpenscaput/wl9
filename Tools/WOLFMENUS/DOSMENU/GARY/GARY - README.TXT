Wolfer Spotlight
Gary Ragland


Inspired by Chris Chokan's breakthrough hex-editing of the Wolf3d EXE in
1998's "Chokage", and assisted by Chris himself, Gary Ragland arguably
became the community's best overall addon maker of 1999. "Assassinate Hitler"
v1.2 and "Schabbs 2000" became classics of fine level design and appealing
EXE changes, accomplished before anyone had yet figured out how to
successfully edit and re-compile the Wolfenstein source code.
 

His levels tended to be a bit cramped, though his last two mods had maps
that pretty much filled the 64 x 64 grid. Regardless of level size, his
addons were all very challenging, well-designed, and just plain fun to play.
 

Gary seemed to run out of inspiration after "Schabbs 2000"; the planned
sequel was released over 3 years later in a much scaled-back form. A set
of levels for episode 4 appeared in the interim.
 

A short series of posts in early 2004 at the DieHardWolfers forums was the
last word from Gary. Or was it?
