Wolfer Spotlight
Harry L. Mass Sr

 
Nowadays in the Wolfenstein community, mention "SR", and many immediately
think of "Spear Resurrection" by AreyeP and MCS. But before that ground-
breaking TC's much-ballyhooed release in Nov. 2001, "SR" brought to mind
one Harry Mass Sr.
 

Although John Bucksnort is the one known today as "The Mutant Maker", and
even had a posthumous tribute to him made by the community named "Beyond
Mutantstein Special Edition", it was his collaboration with Harry Mass Sr,
dubbed "The Mutant Co. Ltd.", that introduced him to Mutant-heavy level
design. Check out Harry's "SR Wolf" series, made with Bob Daum: right from
the get-go, you have the now-famous formula of slime walls, dark ceilings
and/or floors, SoD ammo boxes, many Mutants (including Harry's notorious
"brown boys") and lots of fast action!
 

Harry Sr's major body of solo work was the series he named "The Abbey"
consisting of seven releases, continuing the SR Wolf formula. 
 

After that came "Berlin Express", which in my opinion was his best single
release. "The Hunt" seemed a bit of a letdown for me - suddenly the
atmosphere was lost, as he finally abandoned the formula for conventional
Wolf graphics, though the Mutants and challenging level design remained.
Both TCs won Dome Awards. 
 

That basically ended Harry's Wolfer "career", though he did contribute a
couple of levels to the aforementioned Bucksnort tribute set (12/2002), an
outtake of which was tagged onto the very end of a community levels-contest
collection named "Map Making Mania Melee" in January 2004.


Although Harry isn't active in the Wolf 3-D scene anymore, his website is
still up and running at <Wolfenstein 3D by Harry Sr>.

Note: Since this page was first compiled, Harry has released 'A Long Walk Back'
and this has been added to the list.
