Wolfer Spotlight
DTrade


Inspired by John Bucksnort, or just a shameless imitator? You make the call.
 

Borrowing many of John's graphics, sounds, and even his favorite EXE file,
DTrade made his controversial debut in the Wolfenstein community in early
2001. Initially, the "Mutant Maker" protested the unauthorized use of his
original graphics, but was eventually won over by the add-on artist from
China. John even gave him a 'personal achievement award' for "Warzone I:
Sudden Strike" in March 2001.
 

DTrade's level style is a bit more complex and cramped than John's, but
interesting and well-designed nevertheless. He likes to insert what I call
"key teasers" where you can see a key but have to put in some work to
actually get to it. There are many individual actors waiting to attack you
and enough ammo and health to keep you going if you know where to look. But
the most prominent feature in his designs is the pushwall. He used quite a
few of them, to put it mildly!
 

His last release, a Spear set called "Den of Evil", won a Dome Award in
March 2003.
