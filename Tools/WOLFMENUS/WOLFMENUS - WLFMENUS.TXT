WolfMenu and DOSMenu are simple DOS-based tools to catalogue, search for, and launch 
your Wolfenstein 3-D mods and addons. The menus are user-configurable, and support 
up to 600 entries per menu. Works under Windows too.

The modern wolfer will probably prefer DOSMenu, as it does away with WolfMenu's menu-driven 
"patch-swapper" functions, and presents an immediate list of entries, making it better 
for nesting multiple instances of itself. The DOSMenu sample SPOT.BAT demonstrates 
this nesting of menus. Also, WolfMenu is quite a "memory-hog" and may need about 
600k of conventional memory in a fully-populated configuration to run without "out 
of memory" errors popping up.

Both apps come with detailed instructions and sample BAT files to demonstrate alternate 
ways of organizing your collection. Maybe you can come up with your own scheme!

To get started, unzip the contents of each zip into its own folder (pkunzip users 
must use -d to preserve the directory structure), from the command prompt run SETUP.EXE, 
and then start up the program with the command WOLF (the WOLF command can be executed 
using the Windows shortcut provided with each program). I advise reading the Read 
This First! item. It's lengthy, but has crucial information for effectively using 
WolfMenu and DOSMenu. The F1 and F2 keys bring up a quick help/reminder message.
