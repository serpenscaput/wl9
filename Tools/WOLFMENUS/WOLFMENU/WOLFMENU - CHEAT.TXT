                After starting the game with WOLF.bat:
 
      For basic game controls, check out "READ THIS!" under Options 

                      Then after Get Psyched:

   Press M+I+L simultaneously to give you both keys, maximum health, and
           maximum ammo.  This will also reset your score to zero.  

Ver 1.4 debug mode : press LEFT SHIFT+LEFT ALT+BACKSPACE simultaneously
Ver 1.0 debug mode : press TAB+LEFT CTL+ENTER simultaneously
   
       Then:
             TAB+G - GOD MODE !!!! (health never decreases)
             TAB+I - add 100,000 points to score, add 50 ammo, upgrade weapon
             TAB+W - warp to any level
             TAB+E - end current level (instant elevator to next level)
             TAB+N - turn clipping off (SoD and v1.0 only)
             TAB+C - statistics
             TAB+B - change border color
             TAB+S - slow motion
             TAB+M - display memory usage
             TAB+F - coordinates
             TAB+T - shows graphic images (use right, left arrows to scroll)
             TAB+H - decrease health level
             TAB+Q - immediately quit 

             In Noah 3D, replace TAB with ` key (right above TAB).

Note: WolfMenu automatically enables debug mode for Wolfenstein 3-D and 
      Spear of Destiny. Some of the add-ons with changed EXE files may 
      use different cheat keys or have different debug command-line parameters
      (specify these in ADDON.CFG) or may have debug mode disabled entirely.
