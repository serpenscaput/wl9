   Adding the standalone addons/TC's consists of three steps:

   1. Enter a title for the addon
   2. Enter a DOS path for where the addon is located
   3. Enter the command you would use to launch the addon

   NOTE: if the command is a batch file (.bat extension) you must precede
the command with call (eg. "call chokage"). Otherwise, you will be dropped 
at a DOS prompt in the particular add-on's directory when you leave the game.

   Also, the documentation files must be named README.TXT (and README2.TXT
and README3.TXT for successive files) for the browser to find them. So rename
those MANUAL.TXT and HINTS.TXT files if you want to see them via WolfMenu.

   BTW, you needn't limit yourself to Wolfenstein add-ons or even games. You
can run any DOS application from this part of WolfMenu.
