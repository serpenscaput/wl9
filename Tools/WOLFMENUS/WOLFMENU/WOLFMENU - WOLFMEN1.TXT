Miscellaneous notes:

  In addons Chokage and Wolfenstein Reloaded, each episode must be completed
to get access to the next episode.

  Games Corridor 7 and Operation Body Count have separate setup programs for
changing controls, sounds, etc. Go to the CORR7 or BODYCNT folders and
run SETUP.EXE.

  Addon Escape From The Labyrinth does not update the CONFIG.213 file. Just
update another addon's controls and copy its config file to the ESCAPE
directory and rename it to CONFIG.213 if you need to change something.
Addons The Thing, Secrets of Offenback, and Der Angriff have the same problem
with their CONFIG.WL6 files.

  Addon Tekkoudan does not allow game saving from the main menu (or esc from
the game).  You can F8 from the game to save a game, but this limits you to
the use of only one slot.  To get around this, start a new game, re-load the
saved game from the menu (not F9), then F8 lets you choose another save slot.

  Addon The Golden Episodes uses F9 for exit, rather than F10, and the
quicksave F8 key has been disabled.

  Addon Alexstein has the F10 exit disabled.

  In addons The DOOM Spear, Invasion of the Cartoons, and Gotterdammerung,
selecting the Read This! option throws you out of the game.

  Addons MJ's Headquarters and Spear of Dreams Part 4 will exit if you let
the demo start running.
