VSMAPED is intended to be a general debugging and editing utility for
  level creators. It works for all Wolfenstein/Spear related games I know of.
  Wolfenstein v1.0, v1.4 and Spear of Destiny, BS, C7 and OBC mods can be
  edited, including code-changed mods. Levels may be rectangular of any size
  up to 180x180 tiles. Map entries from 0 up to 65535 can be handled.
  The program uses fig.bmp with symbol images, a color palette file,
  a definition textfile, and a classes textfile containing the information
  for searching. You can make changes to any of these files, fex. create
  special definitions and classes files for some code-changed game.

Walls are shown in the map as miniatures of wall images, objects as symbols.
  Items not in the definitions are shown as entry number modulo 256 in hex,
  walls white and objects red.

Gamemap files are normally rlew-compressed but some are Carmack-compressed too.
  This program can edit and save in all compressions, including none.
  Note: carmack-compression is not used in wolfenstein v1.0.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Running the program
                     At first you can use just 3 buttons:

 GAMEMAP      :*Opens a 'GAMEMAPS' file (or 'MAPTEMP' for Wolfenstein v1.0)
                and a corresponding MAPHEADfile and a VSWAP/GFXTILES file,
                if present. A lost or corrupted mapheadfile can be retrieved
                from the gamemaps file. When saving a damaged mod you are asked
                if the restored mapheadfile is to be saved.
               *The program decides which PALETTE to use (wolf or spear or
                whatever you choose).
               *A CLASSES file used for searching.
   First run:  *Open a 'DEFINITION' file containing the items' names and
                properties. The program suggests wolfenstein or spear game
                type, and the corresponding definition file. You can override
                this by choosing another file.
               *Open a VSWAP(or GFXTILES) file of graphics using 64x64 or
                128x128 pixels. If you CANCEL: no 3D window, and the default
                wall symbols will be used. If there is no vswap file in the
                game directory, load a suitable one from elsewhere.
               *Open a PALETTE file. Most mods use the Wolfenstein3D or 
                Spear of Destiny palette but some have their own.
               *Open a 'CLASSES' file containing search criteria.
   All this information is stored so by the next run you just click 'GAMEMAP'.
   Errors:     *If for some reason the program freezes, press CTRL-ALT-Delete
                to exit, delete 'wt.ini' and start again.
   New mod:     Click 'GAMEMAPS' if you want to change the mod, starting anew.

...............................................................................
Congratulations!Below is a list of levels, and a map of the first level.
                And these buttons, from top downwards:

 Definitions  : Open another definition file.

<multicolor>  : Open another palette file.

 Classes      : Open another classes file (search criteria). 

[Overview     : A window showing the whole map in size 1:3
                when a level is larger than 64x64 tiles.]

 MISC..menu 1 : Files used by this mod. Close the list with a click on it.
            2 : Statistics for the whole mod, all the items used, unlisted too.
            3 : Save current statistics. If none, that for the whole mod.
            4 : Save a list of all level titles.
            5 : Save a picture of the current level.  
            6 : Save the current level as an enhanced floedit level file, *.lvl
                with map dimensions and 3 tables. Accepted by floedit if the
                dimensions are 64 x 64.
            7 : Edit the current definition file (see below).
            8 : Edit the current classes file (see below).
            9 : Set map compression. The gamemaps will be saved with the
                compression you choose:
                None (it actually works!), Normal(rlew) or Extra(rlew+Carmack).
                If unchanged, the original map compression will be used. 
           10 : Change the number of levels or their sizes.
                After consulting the professor, set the number of levels and/or
                the dimensions and click EXECUTE. If the number of levels is
                unchanged, the current level gets the set dimensions, else
                any new extra levels will get the set dimensions.
                On saving afterwards you may be asked if you want to rename the
                game files (fex. to WL8). It's up to you. 
                At present changing the number of levels is a little involved:
               -If you use Carmack compression and want to change the level
                number you must first convert the mod to normal compression,
                make the changes, then convert it back again. 
               -To make an [empty] mod with n levels each of x*y tiles-
                1. open mod - set n to 1 level              - save mod.
                2. open mod - set x and y dimensions.[Clear]- save mod.
                3. open mod - set the number of levels to n - save mod. Voila!
           11 : Do/Don't ignore floors and ceilings. They may not be real.
           12 : Modify image numbers. If all the guards' images numbers are
                8 off fex, it would be tedious to change them all by hand.
           13 : Open a Savegame file. Such files contain less information than
                the gamemaps, but show the game in action. Not for editing.
                There are many ways to save games so it won't always work.

 Statistics   : Shows the contents of the current level. When the definition
                editing window is seen, the list is more detailed.        NOTE:
                Ordinary secret doors are not counted as 'Object-in-wall' here.

 EDIT         : Opens the editing panel. It has its own helpfile.
                The panel can be dragged up/down, uncovering the entries list.
...............................................................................
 3D Image     : A window shows part of the level in 3D as seen from where you
                click the map, more or less as you see it in the game.
                You can look in 4 directions and make the image big or small.
  Floor/ceiling Select background colors on the palette if there are no
     buttons:   floor/ceiling tiles in the game. Click the panel to cancel.
  Cancel colors:Remove all previously selected background colors.
  Save colors:  Save colors to the first line in the definition file.
  Fixed View:   You can lock the viewpoint so that you can make changes and see
                them while editing. Click again to free the viewpoint.
               *Floor/ceiling values of zero are always dark blue so some skies
                are not rendered correctly, sorry. The 3D window works well
                for saved games too, except for pacmen and directional sprites.
                Partly transparent walls are shown correctly.
                There are now additional rules for the definition file:
                1: For sprites,the words' ver '(vertical)and' hor '(horizontal)
                   are reserved and used for directional sprites only.
                2: Do not use direction qualifiers (fex'N')for actors, it makes
                   sure that they look in the right direction in the 3D window.

 TRACE        : For checking whether a level is blocked somewhere, or for fun,
                trace a path through the mod:      Rightclick on a floor tile,
                then all tiles accessible from that point will be marked with
                a cross, avoiding hard objects, up to the next normal/secret
                doors. A second rightclick removes a floor marking.
                Click TRACE again to show the normal map.
...............................................................................
 MARK         : Click and the buttontext lightens up. You are now in mark mode.
                If you click the map, the items lists or the entries list,
                or SELECT a group, all of the chosen items will blink, on all
                levels. The number of marked items in each level is shown.
 in the map:    If a tile in the map has an object on it this will be selected,
                else the solid/floor. If the edit panel is active, then the
                solid/object buttons will determine what is selected.
                In active EDIT mode you can only click the entries list or
                select a group, for not interfering with the editing process.
                A small list shows names of the marked items and groups,
                click the list to hide it. Click MARK again to leave mark mode.

 SELECT       : You can mark whole classes, fex.'weapons', various actors,
                doors. 'object in wall' (not including ordinary pushwalls),
                'not in (definitions)list', 'guard 1'(/3/4)shows GUARDS of
                that skill level (plus guards with no skill level).
                OR you can enter a case-sensitive Search Text
                (Names start in upper case) and accept with the RETURN key.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RESTORE      : Restore the maps in the game from backup (files+'bk').

 SAVE MAPS    : Save the maps to the game. Make a backup first (option).






=========FOR EXPERTS: Editing Definitions and using the entries list===========

---------------------------MODIFYING A DEFINITION FILE-------------------------
                      or making a new one for a special mod.
                  (You CAN of course use a text editor instead ;-)

               *Start 'Edit Definition File'.
               *Click an item in the map, the items lists or the entries list,
                then its definition will appear on the definitions panel :

       <*.txt>: Name of the definition file in use.

   (black box): Line 0 only. Using the images list you can set the start of
                wall images and the start and end index+1 of floor/ceiling
                structures. Needed for mods with this feature. In line 0's
                comment you can type 'spear' or 'wolf' to force the entries
                list settings, or 'new' if the definitions are unfinished,
                or 'single' if there is only one image per wall (like in OBC).

--------------------------------THE CLASSES FILE-------------------------------
 The classes file (*.inf) is for searching items, and is in the VSMAPED
 directory. 'normal.inf' is the default file for Wolfenstein and Spear games.
 To facilitate searching some item names start with a number(1-3 digits), given
 in the classes file. You can make an individual classes file for any mod.
       (Class):                     6: bad health (fex. poison pool)
       1: good health (fex. food)   7: treasure   (giving points)
       2: weapon                    8: superguard, a single item.
       3: ammo                      9: hard object (not in the classes file)
       4: key                      11: Junk food (fex. bloody skeleton)
       5: protection(fex.helmet)  ---: reserved for a future 4th skill.

      *For counting actors: if an item is a single ACTOR, you can add 50,
       if it also is hard, like a torch fex., it will make 59. Fire will be 56.
      *Item names starting in UPPERCASE are searched by the name. If you
       change the names, you must change them in the classes file as well.
      *You are free to rename other classes, fex 'weapon' to 'wapen'.
      *You can add a search text OR: add a new class by preceding its
       name with a class number 10-199 and a space, fex: '14 Ho-Hum'.
 NB!!! The categories: guard 1-4, actors, static objects ,objects in wall,
       not in list, Door, Elevator MUST be kept at the original line numbers.
       Extra names and classes must be added AFTER 'Elevator' !!!
      *HARD OBJECTS with a function (I never saw any) must have numbers
       100-149. Walls can be in classes too: fex. in R.O.M., a switch wall
       works much like a third key, so I have put it in class 4. Also in R.O.M,
       pacmen are ammo and therefore in class 3 and not in 8 (superguard).

------------------------------WORKING WITH THE ENTRIES LIST--------------------

                Lower the edit panel to reveal the entries list underneath.
                This list is mainly used for spotting, picking and marking
                UNLISTED items. Marked items also show up here.
                Before picking an item you must click the button for walls/
                floorcodes or objects in order to determine which map plane
 _ --Buttons--  the value belongs to. The same when clicking the map.
|     CLEAR   : Clears any markings in the entries list. 
|     <-      : A click will mark all items USED in the level with big squares
|               for listed items, smaller squares for unlisted items.
|               Tip: Change level and the markings will accumulate,
|               ultimately showing all items below number 896 used by the game.
|    [<=      : The same goes for button '<=' if present (floors(green) and
|_              ceilings(blue)). Displayed in 640 to 895 in the entries list.] 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                These informations you get by moving the mouse over
                the map or the entries list or the edit lists:

  *To the left:          Totals of static objects, actors, doors and
                         objects-in-wall in the level. Work during editing too.
  *In the entries list:  To the right: wall ID(plane 1), object ID(plane 2),
                         additional ID(plane 3).
  *In the edit lists:    wall/floor/object ID, class, and name.
  *In the map:           Wall/floor ID and name, Object ID(=sprite number+21)
                         and name and possibly a comment.
  *For floors/ceilings:  Image index in the vswap file.
  *Mouse X and Y map coordinates.
  *An actual image from the vswap file. If both solid and object is present
   together, the solid is shown if you are editing solids, else the object.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       A note on map statistics.

A level map consists (normally) of three 64 by 64 planes of 16-bit numbers,
   one for 'solids' (including doors and floor codes), one for objects, and one
   that normally contains zeros but is used by some code-changed games for
   floors and ceilings. Some games (fex. Blake Stone) have only two planes.
  *There ARE a few mods, however, for which plane 2 entries are repeated in
   plane 3. It might be the result of some complicated packing scheme.
   They are not seen in the game (only 2 planes are used) but it IS an error.
   If it bothers you, clear all floors/ceiling structures and save the maps.
  *In the gamemaps file the planes are compressed with rlew or rlew+Carmack
   coding. VSMAPED can handle both as well as no compression.

In VSMAPED the plane entry numbers are treated as follows:

   ID number in map vs type, for the original game:
plane 1-'solids'------------------
$01..$59 (  1- 89):  Wall pairs
$5A..$69 ( 90-105);  DOORS                    max  64
$6A..$8F (106-143):  Floor codes
$90...   (144-   ):  -not used-

plane 2-'objects'-----------------
$01..$12 (  1- 18):  -not used-
$13..$16 ( 19- 22):  start positions
$17..$59 ( 23- 89):  STATIC OBJECTS(visible), max 399
$5A..$69 ( 90-105):  invisible objects
$6A..$119(106-281):  ACTORS                   max 149
$11A...  (282-   ):  -not used-

plane 3-'additional'--------------
$00...   (0...   ):  -not used[=0]-In some games used for floors and ceilings.

The totals of DOORS, STATIC OBJECTS and ACTORS MUST obey the restrictions
  above or the game will crash. Code-changed games may have wider limits.
Wall pairs(except doors) with IDs larger than $3F (63) may not be rendered
  correctly in the game.
Actors include guards (alive or dead), animated objects, missiles etc.
  A missile demands 9 extra unlisted 'actors', a missile duel 18 so please
  watch the actor total.
Start positions, turning points, secret doors and triggers are invisible and
  DON'T count as static objects.
A shareware or demo mod can handle many more walls than it is born with.
  You can add additional walls with VSWAPED.
I prefer the term 'actor' to 'guard' because it is more general.
