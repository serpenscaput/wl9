  VSMUSED is for replacing sound and music chunks in the AUDIOT.* file
  in a wolf3D or Spear of Destiny related game.
  I am no musician so you can REPLACE but not edit sounds and music.

There must be an AUDIOHED.* file present as well, containing the catalog.

Upper buttons:

Open Audio file          AUDIOT plus AUDIOHED files which are to be changed.

LOG                      See a log of changes and saves.

<My portrait>            See this helpfile.

Save to game             -the AUDIOT and AUDIOHED files.  Maybe make a backup.

Restore game             Copy backup (files+'bk') to game files.
                         Maybe delete the backup.

Export selected          -chunk. Can be saved as *.imf.

Save chunks list         -from the display as a textfile.

<The Professor>          Permits you to alter the audiot file. Risky.
   INSERT (number)       dummy lines following after   the selection.
   DELETE (number)       lines following and including the selection.
                         To make use of all this you must recompile the engine!

Lower buttons:           (The center bar can be dragged up and down)

Import<-Audiot file      Please don't import from the same AUDIOT file. Messy!

Import<-chunk  file      -from a valid file consisting of a single chunk.

Replace selected         -chunk in the upper display with the selected chunk
                            in the lower display.

UNDO                     -the latest replacement or alteration.

The displays show chunk number, chunk size in Bytes, and maybe a title text.
   The text is the chunk's name (if any), else this information from VSMUSED:
   <dummy>        :Chunk too small to contain usable data.
   <extra>        :No audiohed entry above this chunk (filesize is supposed).
   <outside file> :The audiohed entry points past the end of the audiot file.
   < 2+ chunks>   :I saw this in one mod where there were 2 or more chunks
                   before the next audiohed entry. Not handled by VSMUSED.

You CAN put a chunk into the '<extra>' entry, at your own risk.

   -I will cite from the Floedit helpfile which explains things nicely:-

<The audio file contains PC-sounds, AdLib sounds and IMF-music.
To play your own MIDI-files in Wolf3D, you have to convert the MIDI music
to IMF music by using the tools "midi2mus" and "mus2imf".
They're available as package "imftools2" by DarkOne. Download from
http://wolfgl.narod.ru or search the internet for the package.

After you downloaded the package, read the file README.TXT that comes with it.
I have NOTHING to do with this package, so DON'T send your questions to me!

After you created your own .IMF files from your midis (Note: rename them!, 
The extension MUST be ".MID" or the converter will fail!), click the button
labeled "Import from chunk file". Then select the IMF file.

Please understand that music is stored in the last chunks in the file. WL1 has
the same number of chunks as WL6, but some are dummies (88 bytes, 13 bytes,..).
A valid music chunk is usually LARGER THAN 7000 BYTES ! Don't import anything
onto other locations unless you change the engine!>
