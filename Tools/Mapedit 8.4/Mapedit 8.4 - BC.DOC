       Introduction

       Operation: Body Count is the 2nd game from IntraCorp, Inc. that
       uses an engine licensed from id Software. The first was Corridor 7.
       Body Count utilizes many of the same features developed especially
       for Corridor 7. (See the Corridor 7 document in this package for a
       list of features new to these two games from IntraCorp. Inc.

       As far as creating floors for Body Count is concerned, the approach
       does not differ markedly from creating floors for Wolf3D, Spear of
       Destiny, Blake Stone, or Corridor 7. If you have never created a
       floor for any of these games before, it is recommended that you
       read through "Tips for Creating/Editing Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny
       Designs". This document is included in the Mapedit package. The
       above document will give you a flavor for what is involved.

       DATA DEFINITION FILES

       MAPEDIT provides data definition files for all games it supports.
       One of these is the MAPDATA file which incorporates graphic symbols
       for all the walls and doors that appear in Body Count. The other
       file is the OBJDATA file which contains graphics symbols that
       represent everything else in the game. The descriptions that appear
       in the MAPEDIT legend window are mostly too long to fit in the
       limited space so you must scroll the legend window horizontally to
       read the entire description. The descriptions are lengthy due to
       the complexity of the graphic designs.

       New Features in Body Count

       To those of you who have played previous 3-D games, the most
       obvious new feature that is immediately apparent in Body Count (as
       well as in its predecessor Corridor 7) is the use of "glass" walls
       through which one can clearly see what is on the other side. This
       "see-through" feature is extended to certain types of doors as well
       as other wall types that partition off the floor space.

       Note: Enemies cannot see through any type of wall. If they can be
       seen moving rapidly about on the other side of a "see-thru" wall,
       it is because they have shifted to Attack Mode for some reason not

                                      -4-
       
       related to the "see-through" feature.

       Another interesting feature is the use of "pseudo" animation. Much
       of the movement in Body Count is inherent and controlled by the
       engine. Some of it needs to be overtly triggered by the floor
       designer with the use of certain triggering object codes. A set of
       triggering object codes is also used to activate the "see-through"
       feature mentioned in the previous paragraph.

       Still another feature is the appearance of bullet holes in some
       walls after shots are fired. Also glass breaking when bullets hit
       it.

       Wall Destruction

       One important feature is the use of the most powerful weapon
       available in this game. This is the Grenade Launcher which fires
       40mm shells and can destroy any wall or room. To avoid problems
       when using such a weapon, it is necessary to protect certain walls
       from being destroyed or damaged. Particularly the outer perimeter
       walls must be protected so that they won't disappear when hit by a
       shell. This would allow exit from the map and cause problems.

       Object code 0059 is used for this purpose. When this code is placed
       in the same cell as any map code, whatever map code is in that cell
       cannot be damaged by a 40mm round. The map codes on either side of
       a door are also protected as are all elevators and entry and exit
       ways so the player will be able to get out when it's time.

       You are advised to study the original levels to see how this code
       is used. Mapedit displays this code in the map window as a yellow
       open square. There are literally hundreds of them in every level.

       Body Count Design Considerations

       Several features, which may not be obvious at first when playing
       the game, are included to make play more interesting and difficult.
       One of these is how the use of certain types of doors will prevent
       the player's shots from passing through an open doorway.

       Essentially, two types of doors are used in Body Count. The
       traditional sliding door (mostly elevator doors) is recognized by
       the game's engine as a real door and when the player shoots through
       an open sliding door, the shots will pass through and hit their
       target. Both the player and the actor can see one another.

       The other type of door used (non-sliding) is really a wall with a
       special object code on it that makes it appear to be a door that
       opens and closes (by the use of animation). Both the player and
       actors can move back and forth unhindered through these doors. But
       ammunition will not penetrate the open doorway. The player is
       forced to wait until an enemy has come through such a door before

                                      -5-
       
       his/her ammo will hit the target, or the player, alternatively,
       must move to the other side of the door. As a result, if enemies
       are seen unmoving on the other side of such a door, the player is
       forced to go in after them rather than waiting for them to come
       out. Further, if enemies are moving towards the doorway, they will
       not attempt to shoot until they pass completely through the
       doorway.

       Another element over which you as a designer will have no control
       and which makes for more difficult play, mostly occurs when the
       game is played at skill levels 3 and R (random). At these higher
       skill levels, the player will occasionally find an enemy actor that
       will not be killed easily. This includes rats, humans, and the
       flying turrets. The player, if not careful, can use up a lot of
       ammo when trying to dispose of these actors. (The player needs to
       switch to the flame-thrower for rats and humans. The flying turrets
       are a challenge, but can be destroyed with rocket grenades (flames
       cannot touch them). To reduce the number of instances where a
       player has to engage a super-enemy, the player must be more
       aggressive and not hang back waiting for the enemy to come to
       him/her.)

       A final element over which you will have no control as you design
       floors for Body Count occurs when the game is played at the random
       level of difficulty. This degree of difficulty is similar to level
       3 except that the player will see many more floor mines (booby
       traps) scattered throughout most floors, that do not exist on the
       floor as it was originally designed. On the other hand, during
       random play, many of the items that were previously hidden from
       view such as Health Packs, Weapons, etc., will usually be much
       easier to find because most of them will appear out in the open.
       Also, enemies will occasionally show up within hidden rooms that
       are accessible via a pushwall.

       More Body Count Design Considerations

       Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny are prison and castle environments. As
       such, the use of narrow corridors is in keeping with the spirit of
       the game (although many wide halls and corridors were used too).
       Hidden rooms entered through pushwalls contained treasure and
       caches of ammo and weapons, but sometimes pushwalls were used as
       shortcuts to other areas.

       Blake Stone occurs in a futuristic sci-fi environment. While there
       were many alien type creatures created by Dr. Goldfire, there were
       also humans. The floor designs were not generally dungeon-like in
       appearance. Hidden rooms were used in virtually the same manner as
       in Wolf3d and SoD.

       Corridor 7 suggests an entirely different environment: a modern
       office and lab complex on earth, which is being slowly converted to
       an out-of-world environment suitable for supporting the alien life
       that is occupying it. Aside from our Space Marine, there are no
       other live humans. Narrow halls are the exception rather than the
       rule.

       Operation: Body Count takes place in twin UN Buildings plus 5 sewer
       levels. There are only humans, rats, and flying turrets. The
       environment is modern and graphics have been designed with this in
       mind.

       Hidden Areas, Push Walls

       Body Count, like its predecessor Corridor 7, contains no treasure.
       Hidden areas normally contain weapons, ammo, flak jackets, heat
       sensors, health packs, and other devices helpful to the survival of
       the player. Many pushwalls must be pushed more than once in order
       to reach what is hidden. Pushwalls move 2 squares (or cells) at a
       time. To move the wall again, it must stop on another push wall
       object code.

       Locked Doors

       There are no locked doors in Body Count. If a door doesn't open, it
       was not intended to open. These are doors that have not had a
       special object code placed on them to force the animation of a door
       opening/closing.










                                       -7-
       
       Special Trigger Codes

       As indicated above, Body Count uses special object codes to cause
       certain walls/doors to appear animated or to be able to see through
       different wall and door types. These are listed below together with
       where and how each code is used.

       Object
       Code     Description
       ----     -----------
       0056     Slow Speed Animation
       0057     Normal Speed Animation
       0058     High Speed Animation
       0067     Sliding Door "see thru" and open/close activator
       0068     Glass "see thru" activator
       0069     Wall "see thru" activator (incl. fences)
       006a     Non-sliding door activator with "see thru"
       006b     No Clipping activated for single map cell

       The above codes are inserted in the same cell on the map as the
       wall/door that is to be activated.

       How Animation Works

       Animation is implemented in the following way. When the program
       detects any wall type with an Animation code on it, the program
       displays the wall represented by that code and the following 3
       codes in rapid sequence. This causes the wall graphic to be
       animated. Any one of the 4 wall types used in the animation
       sequence could be used by itself without an Animation code, thus
       eliminating any movement. Animation speed codes are not used in
       conjunction with doors. These are reserved for certain wall
       graphics. The speed is determined by which animation code you
       select. Choose the one you think gives the effect you desire.

       There is a special type of animation that occurs for certain wall
       types when they are hit by the player's bullets. This animation
       occurs automatically without any overt action required by the
       designer.

       Non-Sliding Doors

       As mentioned above, there are 2 basic types of doors used in Body
       Count. The conventional doors slide left or right when opening. You
       are limited to 63 of this type of door per level. Such doors
       require no special triggering to make them operate. However, non-
       sliding doors do require special triggering.

       Because unconventional doors cannot be handled the same as the
       sliding doors, the animation effect must be applied so that four



                                       -8-
       
       separate door codes are cycled through one time to see the door
       open and in reverse to see the door close. Object codes '67' and
       '6a' are used for this purpose. Each is inserted on the map in the
       same cell as the door that is to be operated.

       If you want to have one of these doors in the open position and not
       allow it to be closed, then choose the fully opened door code for
       the door type you want and then use object code '6b' so that the
       door can be walked through. Code '6b' does 2 things. It makes a
       wall or door appear as a thin partition and then applies "no
       clipping" logic so that it can be walked through.

       To help you determine which doors/walls can be animated, the
       Mapdata legend window in Mapedit will provide some added
       information: the trigger object code needed to animate the action
       at the end of the description and a small letter 'a' in parenthesis
       at the start of the description identifies a map code as being one
       that may be animated.

       NOTE: In the aggregate, you cannot use codes 56-58, 67, 6a, and 6b
       more than 32 times per level. If you exceed 32, Mapedit will
       highlight the Stat "Total Animates" in RED to alert you. If you
       ignore this or do not see it and attempt to execute the level with
       more than 32 "animation" codes, the game will abort with the
       message "BC Aborted". Before restarting the game, take a look at
       the contents of a file in the game directory named "BC.LOG". This
       will contain an error code on the first line. If the code is 703,
       then you've exceeded 32 animation codes for one level.

       NETWORKING & Deathmatch Play

       There are 10 additional levels available for this purpose. They are
       levels 51 through 60. They have large open areas and lots of
       available ammo, weapons, health items, etc. There are no enemy
       actors in these levels.

       While there are starting locations are in each Network level, the
       game will assign random starting locations for each player at the
       start of the game.

       Debugging Your Levels

       To assist you in debugging any levels you create or modify, you can
       run the game in Debugging Mode. To set this up, you start the game
       in the normal way EXCEPT you add a parameter on the command line:

       BC vfr750hondarc45

       You can add other command line parameters before or after the one
       above.

       You can start the game as a "new game" and when you get to the
       first level, to enable the Debugging Keys, hold down and press
       Alt+LeftShift+D. The word "DIAGNOSTICS" will appear on screen.
       Since you're in diagnostic mode and not trying to play the game for
       real, the first thing you may want to do is press  ALT+W, then type
       the level number you want to test and press Enter. You will be
       "warped" directly to that level. After you get there, you can then
       select any of the key combinations below to invoke other debugging
       functions.

       ALT+I          Invincibility/Vulnerability Toggle (God Mode)
       Backspace+G    (Same as above)
       ALT+W          Warp to a different level
       ALT+R          Restock all weapons and ammo
       ALT+T (or T)   Abort to DOS (w/o going through main menu)
       ALT+D          Diminished Light Source toggle
       TAB+D          (same as above)
       TAB+E          Alter floor color
       TAB+Q          Alter ceiling color
       ALT+H          Health
       Backspace+C    Stats
       Backspace+F    Displays current position on screen
       Backspace+I    Increase Score
       Backspace+M    Memory Stats
       Backspace+N    Toggle Gumby Mode (no-clipping)

       NOTE: If for any reason you end up at the game's main menu while in
       Debug mode, you will lose debugging capability.  You will have to
       exit to DOS and restart the game.
