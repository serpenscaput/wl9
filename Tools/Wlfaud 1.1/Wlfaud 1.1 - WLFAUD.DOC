DESCRIPTION:

	WLFAUD will store sounds into or extract sounds from VSWAP.WL1
	files distributed with Wolfenstein shareware version 1.0 - 1.4.  
	In addition, WLFAUD will play the sound if a SoundBlaster compatible
	sound card is present.

	Please be sure to make a backup copy of the original VSWAP.WL1 file.
	This program is not designed to work with VSWAP.WL6 files.

	Input files can be any format (.AU, .VOC, .WAV, .SND, etc) and
	any sample rate; they will be converted as necessary.

	Some examples:

	Play sound #1:

		WLFAUD 1


	Replace sound #1:

		WLFAUD 1 -s foo.wav


	Extract sound #1:

		WLFAUD 1 -e foo.raw


	Replace sound quietly:

		WLFAUD 1 -s foo.wav -q
