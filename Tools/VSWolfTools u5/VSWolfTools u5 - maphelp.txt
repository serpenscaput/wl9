                              About VSMAPED

VSMAPED is intended to be a general debugging and editing utility for
  level creators. It works for all Wolfenstein/Spear related games I know of.
  Both wolfenstein v1.0 and v1.4 can be edited.

It uses fig.bmp with symbols for walls and objects, and a mapdata textfile,
  starting with the character {_} for avoiding confusion with VSWAPED files.
You can make changes to any of these files, fex. new mapdata files for some
  code-changed game. You can write a comment in any mapdata line from col. 47.
The program produces a visual map, somewhat like in Floedit.
Floors are always supposed to have the same indices, other items may vary.
The program can do all that wolfenmap could, + editing, and will replace it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Running the program
                       At first you can use 4 buttons:

(my portrait)  : Show these help instructions.

 GAMEMAPS      : Open a 'gamemaps' file (or 'maptemp' for Wolfenstein v.1)
                 and a corresponding maphead file. The maps can be edited.
                 The program decides which palette to load (wolf or spear).

 SAVED GAME    : Open a 'savegam' file. Its map contains less information than
                 the other two, but it shows the game in action. Not to edit.
                 There are many ways to save games so it does not always work.

 FLOEDIT*.LVL  : Open a floedit level file. Not to edit.

Then you must open a mapdata file containing the items' names and properties.
  The program suggests wolfenstein or spear game type, and corresponding file.
  You can override this by choosing another file. Old files will be converted.
  (For some files a little post-editing is advised, fex. in R.O.M,
  pacmen should be classified as ammo, not superguards.)

Congratulations! You see a map of the first level and maybe a list of levels,
  and these buttons, from top downwards:

 SAVE  menu 1 : Save the decoded mapset, whatever you'll use THAT for.
            2 : Save the current level picture.
            3 : Save the list of level titles.
            4 : Save statistics for the current level.
            5 : Save the current level as a floedit levelfile.

 TRACE        : Trace a path through the mod: Rightclick on a floor and all
                floor tiles accessible from that point will be marked with
               'deaf guard', avoiding hard objects, up to the next normal/
                secret doors. Click TRACE again to show the normal map.

 EDIT         : Opens or closes the editor panel. It has its own helpfile.
                The EDIT panel can be dragged around .

 SELECT       : In mark mode, you can mark whole classes, fex.'weapons',
                various actors, Doors, 'object in wall' (not including common
                pushwalls), 'not in list', or enter a search text for marking.
                It is case-sensitive and all names start in upper case.

 MARK         : Click and the buttontext lightens up. You are now in mark mode.
                If you click the map, the items lists or the graphics list,
                or SELECT a group, all of the chosen items will blink, on all
                levels. The number of marked items is shown. In EDIT mode you
                can only click the graphics list or select a group.
                Click MARK again to leave mark mode.


(multicolor)  : Open a new color palette. Useful for some mods.

 VSWAP        : For 64x64 and 128x128 pixels graphics. Opens a vswap file with
                game graphics. It need not be from the same game. You will see
                wall miniatures in the map and real wall and object images.

 3D           : You will see miniatures of OBJECTS in the level map as well.

 [N           : Pops up when there is more than zeros in the third array.
                Click it and you can also see floors (F) and ceilings (C).
                This may not work for all games of this sort.]


                2 clicks on EDIT produces the graphics list with 3-4 buttons.
 _              The main use of this list is for picking UNLISTED items.
|     C       : Clears any markings in the graphics list. 
|     ->      : A click will mark all items used in the level with squares in
|               the graphics list, small ones for items not in the mapdata file.

|               Hint: Change level and the markings will accumulate. 
|    [=>      : The same goes for button '=>' if present (floors and ceilings).
|               These markings come from 640 to 895 in the graphics list.]
|_    <       : Hides the graphics list.

 mapdata      : Allows you to edit the current mapdata file, or make a new one
 _              for a special mod. You CAN of course use a text editor instead.
| X           : Closes the mapdata panel.
|              *Click an item in the map or items lists or graphics list.
| Item index  : Item index as read from the map.                     Col  1-4.
| Radiobuttons: Type of item, referred to as:' '(solid),'_'(object), 
|               '*'(object in a saved game).                         Col  5.
| Description : A short text (22 characters max). In line 0 col 19-you can type
|               'spear'or'wolf' to force the graphics list settings. Col  6-27.
|               For easier handling some item names start with a number:
|
|                                               5: Protection, fex. helmet.
|                  1: Good Health, fex. food.   6: Bad Health, fex. poison pool
|                  2: Weapons.                  7: -Free to use-
|                  3: Ammo.                     8: Superguards.
|                  4: Keys.                     9: Hard objects, for tracing.
|                 
|               Start, Guard, Dog, SS, Mutant, Officer items are searched by
|               these names. If you change them, you must search them as text. 
| Image #     : Number shown = the vswap wall or sprite index. Zero = none
|               or an automatically generated image.                 Col 38-41.
| Symbol image: Click and select a symbol from the list to represent the item
|               in the map. Symbol zero=automatic. If you want to put symbols
|               of your own make into fig.bmp, please do it in the cells with
|               a white cross. I may use the cells with a red cross for my
|               own additions. Click again to hide the symbol list.  Col 43-46.
| Comment     : Any text, 32 characters max.                         Col 48-79.
| (blue area) : Line 0 only. You can set the start of real wall structures and
|               the start and end index of floor/ceiling structures found in
|               the vswap file. Needed for 'Guns&Glory' and some other mods.
|  ADD        : If the item already exists, it is updated, otherwise added.
|  REMOVE     : Removes the selected item from the mapdata.
|  UNDO       : Undoes the latest ADD or REMOVE.
|  SAVE...    : Saves the updated mapdata file. Its name must start with
|_              '_' (underline).

 statistics   : Shows the contents of the current level, and the important
                numbers of static objects, actors, doors and more.
                If the doors don't have the normal indices, the number of
                static objects and actors are not shown as this would be too
                difficult (yet).
          Note: Common pushwalls are not counted as'Object in wall' here.
                ------------------------------------------------------  

                These are the informations you get by moving the mouse over
                the map or the graphics list og the edit lists:

                *Number of static objects, actors and doors in the level.
                 Works during editing too.

                *In the graphics list: wall ID, s object ID, h additional ID.
                *In the edit lists: wall/floor/object ID, class, and name.
                *In the map: Wall/floor ID and name.
                 Object ID (=sprite number+21) and name.
                *Mouse X and Y map coordinates.
                *Enlarged picture of the graphic symbol pointed to.
                *An actual image from the vswap file (if opened).
                *For floors and ceilings: The image index in the vswap file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       A note on map statistics.

A level map consists of three 64 by 64 arrays of 16 bit numbers,
  one for 'solids' (including doors and floors), one for objects, and one
  that normally contains zeros but is used by some code-changed games.
If the doors are displaced, the mumber of static objects and actors are not
   shown here, as it would be too difficult to calculate at present.
In the gamemaps file these arrays are encoded with one or two coding layers.
   VSMAPED can handle both, but saves only in 'light' encoding.
In this program the array entry numbers are treated as follows:

ID number in map vs type, for the original game:

-----'solids'-----
$01..$59 (  1- 89):  Walls
$5A..$69 ( 90-105);  DOORS                   max  64
$6A..$8F (106-143):  Floor codes
$90...   (144-   ):  -not used-

-----objects------
$01..$12 (  1- 18):  -not used-
$13..$16 ( 19- 22):  start positions
$17..$59 ( 23- 89):  STATIC OBJECTS          max 399
$5A..$69 ( 90-105):  Turning points  etc
$6A..$119(106-281):  ACTORS                  max 149
$11A...  (282-   ):  -not used-

-----additional---
$00...   (0-     ):  -not used- [=0] (floors and ceilings in some games).

The number of doors, static objects and actors must obey the restrictions
  above or the game will not run. Code-changed games may have wider limits.
Walls with IDs larger than $3F (63) may not be rendered correctly in the game
  unless they are doors.
Actors include guards (alive or dead), exploding or animated objects, missiles.
  A missile calls for 9 extra 'actors', a missile duel 18
  so please watch the actor number.
Turning points and secret doors do NOT count as static objects.
I prefer the term 'actor' to 'guard' because it is more general.
