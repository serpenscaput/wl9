For viewing, extracting and replacing wall pictures, sprites and sounds
     in any Wolfenstein3D/spear related VSWAP file. Also wolfenstein v1.

*VSWAPED has all the features of the former Wolfenpack 3.8, plus:
    Supports big graphics (128x128 pixels);
    EDIT: You can replace any number of walls, sprites and sounds, as follows:
                             - - -
*Select an item in the list to view/hear or replace.
*Animate any set of selected walls or sprites.
*For walls and sprites, click the picture and see the figure against a
   background with 'normal' ceiling colors of the level.
*The current picture/sound is stored in the program directory as
   wp.bmp/wp.wav from where it can be opened in an editor, such as Floedit,
   or another opened VSWAPED program.
                             - - -
*    (My portrait): Read this helpfile.

*LOG: A cumulative logfile with the changes you have made. It can be marked,
      copied and deleted like any other text.

*The multicolor button opens a new palette file (*.pal).

*     The 'Palette tool' enables you to extract the color palette of a game
      in a few minutes. See the tool's help file for how to do it.

                             ---ooo---

*Open a vswap file with 64x64 or 128x128 pixels graphics and if you like,
   a textfile with standard descriptions. They start with the character {-}
   for avoiding confusions with VSMAPED files. The program decides which
   palette (wolfenstein or spear) will be used initially.
   You can make your own descriptions for special games.
   It is quite simple, see how to do it in R O M.txt.

*Select any set of items and save them together. If the filename is 'default',
   the items will be saved as 'wallxxxx.bmp', spritexxxx.bmp, soundxxxx.wav'.
   If 'default' is replaced with a name, fex 'pp', the items will be saved as
   'ppwallxxxx.bmp', 'ppspritexxxx.bmp', ppsoundxxxx.wav'.
   Pictures will be saved with the palette in use.

*Item DETAILs can be shown in decimal or hex. The true data size is shown,
   not the allocated space. For sounds,  the duration in seconds is shown.

*You can disable/enable image thumbnails in the list.

*Shows picture coordinates, color index and the color itself.

*EDIT: Open the EDIT panel.

 ^ *Select the item to be replaced.
 | *File> : Import from a file. 
`| *App>  : First start a new VSWAPED program. Select an item in the new VSWAP
 |          file. Click the APP button in the old, then the item is copied.
 | *For a sprite, you may check 'Tight'and save some space, allowing for more
 |    complicated sprites.
 |_*Click USE to incorporate the new item into the vswap file.
   *Repeat the steps above as much as you like.
   *You can UNDO all replacements at once.
   *Click X to close the EDIT panel.
   *When finished, click SAVE to save the modified file to the game.
      Optionally make a backup copy (name+'bk') of the original file.

*Add item: Add walls, sprites, or sounds to the vswap file. Except for walls,
      the game exe must usually be recompiled to use the additions.
      Select in the category of the item to be added. Sprites and sounds will
      be added at the end of their category but for walls: select the item just
      ahead of the planned addition. Door images must always be the last, and
      the vswap file contains no information of which walls are door images.

*RESTORE: Restore the game's vswap file from the backup copy.

     -Pictures must be in bmp format, but can be of any size. If needed,
      the colors will be resampled to the nearest colors in the game palette,
      and the picture will be resized to 64x64 or 128x128 pixels.

     -the size of a compressed sprite must not exceed 4096 bytes
      (or 16384 for 128x128 pixels graphics, I think).

     -Sounds must be 8-bit mono in RIFF wav format and less than 65536 bytes
      when resampled (if needed) to the standard 6896 Hz of the games
      (using linear interpolation].

This program does not rival Floedit, but it DOES run on 64-bit machines and
    is better in some respects, such as in handling sprites and big graphics.
