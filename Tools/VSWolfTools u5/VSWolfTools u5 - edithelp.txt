                                    EDITOR

You can use all features of the program in edit mode except tracing.
Both v1.4 and v1.0 can be edited.
If a mod is not a standard wolf/spear mod, You will be better off
   if you make a special mapdata file for that mod (edit mapdata).

  The controls are from upper-left:             Large numbers

 App> *Import the selected level from another gamemaps file.
       (Start a new VSMAPED program, select the wanted level there or
       open a *.lvl file. Then click the App> button in the old program.
       The level is then copied to the current level).

-Lev- *Edit level title (max 16 characters).

 ?    *Read this helpfile.

 Rest *Restore the maps in the game from backup (files+'bk').

 C    *Cut  selection. The values inside will become zero.

 K    *Copy selection. The inside will be left unchanged.

 P    *Paste selection.

 #    *Open the 'Number' panel. It shows the most and least significant byte
       in a (large) number. You can pick it or insert a value in the map.
       It is here because some mods have special information in corner cells
       with quite large values. Use left or right mousebutton.

$$$   *Showing content of left and right mousebutton for inserting/filling.
 
LR    *Click and 'LR' turns into 'X'. Inserting/filling now alternates
       between 'left' and 'right' items. Click again to return to LR.

  (at)     *Undo the latest changes in the current level.

 Restore *the game from backup (files+'bk').

 Save    *the maps to the game. Make a backup (option).

---Map mode (what to edit):
 W   *Walls (N/S and E/W faces shown) and Doors.
 F   *Floor codes.
 O   *Objects.
(f)  *Floor   structures | (In some mods). If there are no structures, the
(c)  *Ceiling structures | buttons don't show, click to open for the buttons.

---Edit mode (what to do):
 p   *Pick   an item, fex. a wall with the left mousebutton and a floor code
             with the right, from the map or the lists below or
             the graphics list.
 i   *Insert the item,                       use left or right mousebutton.
 f   *Fill   an area with the item,          use left or right mousebutton.
 s   *Select a rectangular area for copying, use any mousebutton.

Below are 4 lists of items showing thumbnail, map index, (class) and name,
   sorted by map index except objects which are sorted by class first.

You can undo the latest changes in a level unless you go to another
   level, then the changes become permanent. 
It is strongly recommended that you let the program make a backup 
   when you save the maps to the game.
A copied selection can be pasted to another level in the same or another game.
   (copy the selection, open another gamemaps file and paste it to a level).
When you are editing floor or ceiling structures, press any key and see an
   overlay of walls and floor patterns as long as the key is pressed.
   Useful for aligning structures.

If you deselect the edit controls (click on the lowered tab) you can
   click entries in the items lists to blink in the picture, and trace also.
   Click a tab and you are back in edit mode.
