  VSMUSED is for replacing music chunks in the AUDIOT.* file in a wolf3D or
  Spear of Destiny game. I am not a musician so you can only replace music.

There must be an AUDIOHED.* file present as well, containing the catalog.

The Buttons are:

<My portrait>            See this helpfile.
LOG                      See a log of changes and saves.
Open Audio file          AUDIOT and AUDIOHED files which are to be changed.
Save to game             -the AUDIOT and AUDIOHED files. Maybe make a backup.
Restore game             Copy (files+'bk') to game files.  Maybe delete the backup.

Export selected          -chunk
Save chunks list         as a textfile.
Add chunk                Add new IMF music to the audiot file. It will appear as

                         an empty chunk at the end of the list. To make use of it 

                         demands that you recompile the exe file.

                  -files to insert-
Import<-Audiot file      -from some other game  OR:
Import<-chunk  file      -a valid file consisting of a single chunk.
Replace selected         -chunk in the upper display with the selected chunk
                            in the lower display.
UNDO                     -the latest replacement or new chunk.

The displays show chunk number, chunk size in Bytes, and maybe a title text.
   The text is the chunk's name (if any) or information from the program:
   <extra>        :No audiohed entry above this chunk (filesize is supposed).
   <outside file> :The audiohed entry points past the end of the audiot file.
   < 2+ chunks>   :I saw this in one mod where there were 2 or more chunks
                   before the next audiohed entry. Not handled by VSMUSED.

You CAN put a chunk into the '<extra>' entry, but it is not common practise.

   -I will cite from the Floedit helpfile which explains things nicely:-

The audio file contains PC-sounds, AdLib sounds and IMF-music.
To play your own MIDI-files in Wolf3D, you have to convert the MIDI music
to IMF music by using the tools "midi2mus" and "mus2imf".
They're available as package "imftools2" by DarkOne. Download from
http://wolfgl.narod.ru or search the internet for the package.

After you downloaded the package, read the file README.TXT that comes with it.
I have NOTHING to do with this package, so DON'T send your questions to me!

After you created your own .IMF files from your midis (Note: rename them! , 
The extension MUST be ".MID" or the converter will fail!), click the button
labeled "Import from chunk file". Then select the IMF file.

Please understand that music is stored in the last chunks in the file. WL1 has
the same number of chunks as WL6, but some are dummies (88 bytes, 13 bytes,..).
A valid music chunk is usually LARGER THAN 7000 BYTES ! Don't import anything
onto other locations unless you change the engine!
