MapEdit 4.1 - Wolfenstein Map Editor                  (c) 1992  Bill Kirby


To use MapEdit, unpack the archive into the directory where Wolfenstein
is installed.  Type MAPEDIT to start the editor.


Key funtions:

arrows - select level to view
     Q - quit (you will be prompted to save)
     C - clear level (grey brick around the outside of an empty level)
     O - toggle object display
     F - toggle floor display
   

Map window:

Whenever the mouse is in the map window, the map and object data for the
selected square will be displayed beneath the window.  Clicking the mouse
will change either the map or object data to the currently selected item.


Legend window:

The window on the right side of the screen displays the map/object legend.
Clicking on UP/DOWN scrolls through the list.  Clicking on MAP/OBJ switches
between the map and object lists.  Clicking on an item in the list makes
it the "current" item.

After each guard, there is a 3 character description which specifies
what level the guard is, whether they are moving or stationary, and
what direction they are facing/walking.  For example, "1/S/E" means 
a level 1 guard, stationary, facing east.


MAPDATA.DEF and OBJDATA.DEF:

If you figure out a new object, you can add it's description to the
object/map list by editing the MAPDATA.DEF or OBJDATA.DEF file.
Each line in the file contains 3 items:

0000 0000 Objectname

The first four digits are HEX for the object number.  Right now, even
though their are 4 digits, you can only put objects from 0000-00ff in.

The second four digits define how the object will look in the map.
The first two digits are the primary/secondary colors.  The third
digit is the graphic type, and the fourth digit is the character
string to use if the graphic type is "text".

   0 - black
   1 - blue
   2 - green
   3 - cyan
   4 - red
   5 - magenta

author of WMAP, who figured out the original map file formats.  

Thanks Hosko!
