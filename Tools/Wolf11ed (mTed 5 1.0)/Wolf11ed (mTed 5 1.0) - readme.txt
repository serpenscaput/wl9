*** Wolf11 Ed ***   " mTed5 v1.0 "

Map Editor for Castle Wolfenstein 3D v1.1
=========================================


Notice how when the new version of Wolf3D came out there were a
few little bux fixes, but the biggest bummer was the map editor/readers
made for the 1.0 version mysteriously stopped working.

After a lot of thought and quite a bit of head scratching, a friend and
myself managed to decipher what the guys at Apogee had done to neatly
encrypt & compress their mapfiles, and supsequently we did a few
modifications on the source to MAPEDIT4 (by someone - I had a HD crash and
lost all my source etc so I cant remember who originally wrote it) and came
up with a new editor that was slightly easier to use, and as a big bonus
can edit all 6 episodes of the registered WOLF-3D.  (I was going to allow
for it to edit the non registered version, but like I said my HD crashed
and all my source was zapped {sniff})

So here it is:

You need a mouse to use mTed.

Files needed to run mTed:

mTed.exe    - the main program
egavga.bgi  - graphics library
mapdata.def - legend for map items
objdata.def - legend for objects
the wolf3d map files "gamemaps.wl6" & "maphead.wl6" should be in the same
directory as mTed (ie: you shuld plonk mTed in your wolf3d directory)

**note** this program will only work with Wolf3d (v1.1 and possibly above)
         registered to include episodes 1-6.
          (ie: if you havent got any .wl6 files it won't work)

How to use it:

keys:

up/down       : go to next/prev level of the current episode
left/right    : go to next/prev episode (you will be asked if you
                want any changes saved before going to the next
                episode)
F             : toggle displaying of floor hearing zones
O             : toggle displaying of objects
C             : clear the current level
Q / ESC       : quit (asks you if you want to save any changes)

The basic idea is to select an object/map item from the legend on the right
of the screen by pointing to it and pressing either the left or right
mouse button.  (You can have different things in either button)  Then go and
put them on the map wherever you want by pressing that button.  (on the
lower right is an indicator showing what each button is currently holding).

{note: they arent initialised by default so its a good idea to go and
       put something in each button before you start or you might get
       some strange results - this was on my list of bugfixes before
       the source got chewed up}

For those lucky enough to have a 3 button mouse, you can pick up an
object/map-item directly from the map (saves a lot of time) by pointing at
the thing you want to pick up, pressing and holding the middle button and
then pressing the left/right button.  What you were pointing at gets
transferred into the appropriate button.

And thats about it as far as using the editor goes.. Getting the levels to
work as you want is another story, but you'll get the hang of it sooner or
later.  I was going to include a level that I had created, but it got
blasted along with the source and about 100 other megs of stuff... such is
life I suppose.
