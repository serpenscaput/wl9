Unpack the .ZIP file into the subdirectory where you have Wolf3D installed.

WolfEdit allows you to modify the VSWAP.WL1 file, which contains the images
used by Wolfenstein 3-D from Apogee.  Before running WolfEdit, you need to 
make a backup of the VSWAP.WL1 file.  The backup should be called VSWAP.BAK.  
WolfEdit uses this file for restoring wall images to their original state.

The upper left corner of the screen contains the wall images.  Use the 
mouse to draw in this area.  To change the color the mouse draws with, 
click in the palette area.  A diffent color is associated with each mouse 
button.

Key definitions:

UP/DOWN: scroll between the 64 different wall images

  Q: quits (changes are saved automatically)
  L: load a previously saved wall image
  S: save the current wall image to a .WAL file
  R: restore the current wall image (using VSWAP.BAK)
  C: clear the current wall image to the current left mouse color
  G: import a GIF file into the current wall image 

The L and S keys allow you to save/load .WAL files.  A .WAL file is
simply a binary file containing the data for a wall image.  It is not
in any standard format that another program could use.  If you don't
include an extension on the filename you type, .WAL is added.

The R key replaces the current image with the corresponding image from
the VSWAP.BAK file.

The C key clears the wall image using the color that is currently 
associated with the left mouse button.

The G key allows you to load a GIF image, select a 64x64 section of it, 
and copy it to the current wall image.  I included this feature so you 
can use the paint/draw program of your choice to design the graphics. 
It is important to note that the palette of Wolf3d is fixed, and any  
GIF you import will have to be converted to the Wolf3d palette.  This 
is done automatically by WolfEdit, but it sometimes results in a noticable 
change between the GIF and the wall image.  Also, if the GIF you select 
is bigger than 320x200, only the upper-leftmost 320x200 will be loaded. 

I have included several .WAL files, and the GIFs that they were made from:

BOB.WAL    - Bob!
CANDY.WAL  - little girl
LYAP.WAL   - lyapunov fractal
