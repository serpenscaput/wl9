                             VSVGAED

VSVGAED is for editing the VGAGRAPH.* file. Any item, except
the image dimensions table, can be replaced. The program cannot
(yet) show endscreens and fonts, but they can be replaced anyway.
!!!Be careful when you change anything. You may ruin your mod!!!

The controls are, from top downwards:

  HELP          :See this helpfile.
  LOG           :See a log of changes.
  Open VGAfile  :Open a VGAGRAPH, VGAHEAD and VGADICT file.
                   The program decides which palette to be used
                   for pictures (wolf or spear).
  Open palette  :Override the program's choice.
  SP            :Return to the Standard Palette (wolf or spear).
  File>         :Open a file to replace the selected chunk with a
                   picture, palette or raw data as demanded.
                   Endart can be imported but is better edited here.
  App>          :Import a Picture or a Demo from another vgafile
                  The procedure is as follows:
                  1: Open the vga file to be changed.
                  2: Start a new VGAED containing a wanted vga file.
               -> 3: Select an item to be changed in the old file.
              |   4: Select an item to import in the new file.
              |   5: Click the App button in the old program.
              |   6: USE the imported item.
              '-     repeat if more items must be replaced.
                  7: Close the new program.
  USE           :Carry out the replacement. If you don't like it:
  UNDO          :-the latest change.
                     An imported chunk always replaces the chunk
                     selected in the list, if possible.

  Export selected  :Save the selected chunk in the proper format:
                     picture (with the palette in use), palette,
                     text, raw data.
  Save chunks list :Save the chunks list as text.

  Save to game     :Save the VGAGRAPH and VGAHEAD files to the 
                     game directory, maybe make a backup copy
                     (file+'bk') of the originals.
                     The VGADICT file will remain unchanged.
  Restore game     :Reinstall the original files, maybe
                     delete the backup files.

  <The Professor>  :Will permit you to ADD a picture, endscreen or
                     text/endart to the vgagraph file. Bear in mind
                     that any addition calls for a RECOMPILATION OF THE EXE!
                     So only add something if you  KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
                     As in Floedit, any item is added as the
                     last of its kind, and the chunks sequence 
                     can be rearranged, removing all 'Null' items.

A click on a line in the chunks list will select the item, and its hex
  start address and decimal absolute and compressed size is shown below.
The chunks come in various types:

  Image dimensions :Maintained by the program and not to edit.
  Font             :Two fonts sized 10 and 13.
  Picture          :Image and its width and height.
  Null             :-Not useful-
  Endscreen        :DOS-like screen in a format unknown to me.
  Palette          :Spear of Destiny contains several palettes.
  Demo             :Game demo, with level number.
  Endart           :Metatext with pictures shown in the game.
  Text             :Plain text, treated here as endart.

Pictures must be imported in BMP format, of any size up to
  320x200 pixels, and the compressed size must not exceed 64 Kbytes.
  This size depends on the picture, palette and VGADICT data,
       just give it a try.
  If needed, the colors will be sampled to the nearest colors
  in the palette used, and the picture may be clipped to dimensions
  divisible by 4.
Texts are best edited inside the program.
Other item types will be imported as raw data.

Fonts:      Use the WSF font editor (available at www.wolfnode.de).
Endscreens: Use the ScreenEditor    (available at www.wolfnode.de).
Demos:      To record a demo, start Wolfenstein with parameter 
             "goobers" or Spear with "debugmode", and hold down
              the <TAB> key as you see the startup screen until
              you get an inputbox asking for the level to record.
Endart: or TEXT in Spear is a normal text and may be edited
              as such. for Endart there are some commands
              worth knowing:
 ^P[ENTER]               Start a new page. MUST be the first command.
 ^C<hex digit>           Change text color to this number in palette.
 ^G<y>,<x>,<pic>[ENTER]  Draw a graphic and push margins.
                            y,x are pixels, pic is chunk number.
 ^L<x>,<y>               Locate to a specific spot,
                            x in pixels, y in lines.
 ^E[ENTER]               Absolute end of this layout.

          I will thank ID for releasing the source files,
         and Floedit for providing the information above.


                 Sorry for the short help text
                but I trust that those who dare
                 tamper with the VGAGRAPH file
                   know what they're doing.

                          Vincent,
