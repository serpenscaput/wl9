                              About VSMAPED

VSMAPED is intended to be a general debugging and editing utility for
  level creators. It works for all Wolfenstein/Spear related games I know of.
  Wolfenstein v1.0 and v1.4 and Spear of Destiny mods can be edited, including
  code-changed mods. Levels may be rectangular of any size up to 160x160 tiles.
  Map entries up to 65535 can be handled.
  The program uses fig.bmp with symbol images, a color palette file,
  and a descriptions textfile. You can make changes to any of these files,
  fex. create a special descriptions file for some code-changed game.

Walls are shown in the map as miniatures of wall images, objects as symbols,
  and items not in the descriptions: entry number modulo 256 as hex,
  walls white and objects red.

Gamemap files are normally rlew-compressed but some are carmack-compressed too.
  This program can edit and save in all compressions, including no compression.
  Note: carmack-compression is not used in wolfenstein v1.0.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Running the program
                     At first you can use just 3 buttons:

 GAMEMAP      :*Opens a 'gamemaps' file (or 'maptemp' for Wolfenstein v1.0)
                and a corresponding maphead file and VSWAP file, if present.
                The program decides which palette to use (wolf or spear or
                whatever you choose). If it is not the first run, everything
                is loaded automatically, and the program is ready to use.

 LOG          : View logfile of changed levels and compression.

(my portrait) : View these help instructions.
...............................................................................
(First run):   *Open a 'descriptions' file containing the items' names and
                properties. The program suggests wolfenstein or spear game
                type, and the corresponding descriptions file. You can override
                this by choosing another file.
               *Open a palette file. Most mods use the Wolfenstein3D or 
                Spear of Destiny palette.
               *Open a VSWAP file with 64x64 or 128x128 pixels graphics.
                If there is none in the game directory, find one elsewhere.
                If you CANCEL: no 3D window, and the default wall symbols will
                be used.
    All this information is stored so by the next run you just click 'GAMEMAP'.

Congratulations! Below is a list of levels, and a map of the first level.
                 And these buttons, from top downwards:

[Overview     : Show a window with the whole map in size 1:3 when a level is
                larger than 64x64.]

 MISC..menu 1 : Files used by this mod. Close the list with a click.
            2 : Save a picture   of the current level.  
            3 : Save statistics for the current level.
            4 : Save the current level as an enhanced floedit level file, *.lvl
                (with map size and 3 tables). Accepted by floedit if 64 x 64.
            5 : Save a list of all level titles.
            6 : Set map compression. On closing the program or opening a mod:
                Save the gamemaps with the compression you choose:
                None (it actually works!), Normal(rlew) or Extra(rlew+Carmack).
                If unchanged, the original map compression will be used. 
            7 : Edit the current descriptions file. (see below)
            8 : Edit 'Classes.txt' (see 'Modifying... Name' below).
            9 : Change the number of levels or their sizes.
                After consulting the professor, set the number of levels and
                the dimensions and click EXECUTE. If the number of levels is
                unchanged, the current level gets the set dimensions, else
                any new extra levels will get the set dimensions.
                On saving you may be asked if you want to rename
                the game files(fex. to WL8). It's up to you.
               -To make an (empty) mod with n levels each of x*y tiles-
                (at present it is a little involved, do this):
                1. open mod - set n to 1 level              - save mod.
                2. open mod - set x and y dimensions.
                              (make all entries zero)       - save mod.
                3. open mod - set the number of levels to n - save mod.
                              Finished!
           10 : Open a Savegame file. This contains less information than
                the gamemaps, but shows the game in action. Not for editing.
                There are many ways to save games so it won't always work.
           11 : Do/Don't ignore floors and ceilings. They may not be real.
           12 : Statistics for the whole mod, all the items used.

 Statistics   : Shows the contents of the current level. When edit-descriptions
                is open, it shows individual items.                      NOTE:
                Ordinary secret doors are not counted as 'Object-in-wall' here.

 EDIT         : Opens or closes the editing panel. It has its own helpfile. To
                disable: click the down tab. The panel can be dragged up/down.
...............................................................................
 3D Image     : A window shows part of the level in 3D as seen from where you
                click the map, just as you see it while playing the game.
                You can look in 4 directions and zoom in and out.
                NB!!! When editing is enabled, the viewpoint is fixed so that
                you can make changes and see them immediately without moving
                the viewpoint. The view is freed by disabling editing, see
                above. Floor/ceiling values of zero are always dark blue so
                some skies are not rendered correctly, sorry. The 3D window
                works well for saved games too, except for pacmen and
                directional sprites.
                I have now made additional rules for the descriptions file:
                1: For sprites, the words 'ver'(vertical) and 'hor'(horizontal)
                   are reserved and used for directional sprites only.
                2: Do not use direction qualifiers (fex'N') for actors, to make
                   sure that they look in the right direction in the 3D window.

 TRACE        : For checking whether a level is blocked somewhere, or for fun,
                trace a path through the mod:      Rightclick on a floor tile,
                then all tiles accessible from that point will be marked as
                'Deaf Guard', avoiding hard objects, up to the next normal/
                secret doors. A second rightclick removes a floor marking.
                Click TRACE again to show the normal map.
...............................................................................
 MARK         : Click and the buttontext lightens up. You are now in mark mode.
                If you click the map, the items lists or the graphics list,
                or SELECT a group, all of the chosen items will blink, on all
                levels. The number of marked items in the level is shown.
                In active EDIT mode you can only click the graphics list or
                select a group, for not interfering with the editing process.
                A small list shows names of the marked items and groups.
                Click the list to hide it. Click MARK again to leave mark mode.

 SELECT       : You can mark whole classes, fex.'weapons', various actors,
                doors, 'object in wall' does not include ordinary secret doors.
                'not in (descriptions)list'.
                'guard 1'(/3/4)shows GUARDS of that skill level (plus guards
                with no skill level OR you can enter a case-sensitive Search
                Text(Names start in upper case) and accept with the RETURN key.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RESTORE      : Restore the maps in the game from backup (files+'bk').

 SAVE MAPS    : Save the maps to the game. Make a backup (option).

================FOR EXPERTS: Editing Descriptions and graphics List============

---------------------------MODIFYING A DESCRIPTIONS FILE-----------------------
                      or making a new one for a special mod.
                  (You CAN of course use a text editor instead ;-)
                           Start 'Edit Descriptions File'.
               *Click an item in the map, the items lists or the graphics list,
                then its description will appear on the descriptions panel:

       <*.txt>: Name of the descriptions file in use.

   (black box): Line 0 only. Using the images list you can set the start
                of wall images and the start and end index+1 of floor/ceiling
                structures. Needed for mods with floors and ceilings.
                In line 0's comment you can type 'spear' or 'wolf' to force the
                graphics list settings, or 'new' for abnormal mods.

|               For abnormal mods: if an item is a single ACTOR, you can add 50,

|               if it also is hard, like a torch fex., it will make 59.
|               Objects starting in uppercase are searched by the name. If you
|               change the names, you must edit 'classes.txt' as well.
|               You are free to rename other classes, fex 'weapon' to 'waffe'.
|               You can add a search text OR: add a new class by preceding the
|               name with a class number 10-199, fex: '10Ho-Hum'.
                NB!!! New classes must be added AFTER 'not in list'!
|               HARD OBJECTS with a function(I never saw any) must have numbers
|               100-149. Walls can be in classes too: fex. in R.O.M., a switch
|               wall works much like a third key, so I have put it in class 4.
|               Also in R.O.M.,pacmen are ammo and put in class 3 and not in 8.
|40-43 Image #: Wall or sprite index. Click an image in the list below.

|45-48 Symbol#: Click a symbol in the list below to represent the item in the
|               map. Symbol zero=automatic. You can add a floor code by using
|               a floor code symbol and remove one by using any other symbol.
|               If you want to put symbols of your own make into fig.bmp,
|               please do it in the cells with a white cross, as I may use
|               those with a red cross for my own additions.

------------------------------WORKING WITH THE GRAPHICS LIST-------------------

                Lower the edit panel to reveal the GRAPHICS LIST underneath.
                This list is mainly used for spotting, picking and marking
                UNLISTED items. Before picking an item you must click the
                button for walls, floorcodes or objects in order to decide
 _ --Buttons--  which map plane the value belongs to. 
|     CLEAR   : Clears any markings in the graphics list. 
|     <-      : A click will mark all items USED in the level with big squares
|               for listed items, smaller squares for unlisted items.
|               Tip: Change level and the markings will accumulate,
|               ultimately showing all items used by the game.
|    [<=      : The same goes for button '<=' if present (floors(green) and
|_              ceilings(blue)). Displayed in 640 to 895 in the graphics list.] 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                These are the informations you get by moving the mouse over
                the map or the graphics list og the edit lists:

  *To the left:         Total of static objects, actors, doors and
                        objects-in-wall in the level. Works during editing too.
  *In the graphics list: wall ID, object ID, additional ID.
  *In the edit lists:    wall/floor/object ID, class, and name.
  *In the map:           Wall/floor ID and name, Object ID(=sprite number+21)
                         and name.
   For floors/ceilings:  Image index in the vswap file.
  *Mouse X and Y map coordinates.
  *An actual image from the vswap file.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       A note on map statistics.

A level map consists (normally) of three 64 by 64 planes of 16-bit numbers,
   one for 'solids' (including doors and floor codes), one for objects, and one
   that normally contains zeros but is used by some code-changed games for
   floors and ceilings.
   There ARE a few mods, however, for which array 1 or 2 entries are repeated
   in array 3. It could be a result of some plan to save 10 bytes per level.
   Not seen in the game (only 2 arrays are used) but it IS an error.
   If it bothers you, clear all floors and ceilings and save the maps again.
In the gamemaps file the 3 arrays are compressed with rlew or rlew+Carmack
   coding. VSMAPED can handle both as well as no compression at all.
In VSMAPED the array entry numbers are treated as follows:

   ID number in map vs type, for the original game:

table 1-'solids'---
$01..$59 (  1- 89):  Wall pairs
$5A..$69 ( 90-105);  DOORS                   max  64
$6A..$8F (106-143):  Floor codes
$90...   (144-   ):  -not used-

table 2-objects----
$01..$12 (  1- 18):  -not used-
$13..$16 ( 19- 22):  start positions
$17..$59 ( 23- 89):  STATIC OBJECTS(visible) max 399
$5A..$69 ( 90-105):  invisible objects
$6A..$119(106-281):  ACTORS                  max 149
$11A...  (282-   ):  -not used-

table 3-additional-
$00...   (0-     ):  -not used[=0] -used for floors and ceilings in some games.

The number of doors, static objects and actors must obey the restrictions
  above or the game will crash. Code-changed games may have wider limits.
Wall pairs(except doors) with IDs larger than $3F (63) may not be rendered
  correctly in the game.
Actors include guards (alive or dead), animated objects, missiles etc.
  A missile demands 9 extra 'actors', a missile duel 18 so please watch
  the actor total in this case.
Start positions, turning points, secret doors and triggers DON'T count
  as static objects.
A shareware or demo mod can handle many more walls than shown here,
  you can add additional walls with VSWAPED.
I prefer the term 'actor' to 'guard' because it is more general.
