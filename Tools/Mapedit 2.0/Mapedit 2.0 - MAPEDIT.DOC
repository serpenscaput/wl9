MapEdit - Wolfenstein Map Editor

The following keys have specific functions:

arrows - select level to view
   q,Q - quit (you will be prompted to save)
   c,C - clear level (grey brick around the outside of an empty level)
   o,O - toggle object display
   d,D - toggle decoration display
   m,M - toggle multiple brick type display

As you move the mouse around the level, two hex numbers will be displayed.
One for the map data, and one for the object data.  Clicking the mouse
in the map window will place the current object (displayed in the lower
right corner of the screen) on that map position.  Clicking on OBJ or MAP
switches the list between object and map data.  UP and DOWN scroll through
the list of object/map entries.  Clicking on an entry makes it the current
draw object.

Each level MUST have at least 1 secret door, 1 guard, and 1 treasure, or
the game will hang when trying to compute the percentages.

If you figure out a new object, you can add it's description to the
object/map list by editing the MAPDATA.DEF or OBJDATA.DEF file.
