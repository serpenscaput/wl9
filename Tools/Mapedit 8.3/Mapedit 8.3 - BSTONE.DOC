       Introduction

       For the many who enjoyed creating new floors for Wolfenstein 3D(tm)
       and Spear of Destiny(tm), you will be even more delighted with what
       Blake Stone(tm) has to offer over the previous games.

       At this writing there is only one known editor (MAPEDIT Vers. 8 or
       later) that lets you create new floors for either Blake Stone game.
       Since many of you may have already used MAPEDIT to create Wolf and
       SoD levels, you should be able to begin your designs with only a
       relatively small amount of your time invested in learning the
       special features required for Blake Stone levels.

       The editor aside, the Blake Stone engine offers a number of
       improvements over its predecessor.  Areas of design that often
       caused problems in Wolf3D and SoD floors have been eliminated in
       Blake Stone. Some of the features make it much easier to create
       floors that don't lead to the inevitable "turkey shoots" which were
       a hallmark of the earlier games. MAPEDIT makes it very easy to
       implement these new features. The implementation by MAPEDIT of the
       Blake Stone features described below is explained in MAPEDIT.DOC.

       There is a separate section below devoted to the features of Blake
       Stone: Planet Strike.

       Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold Floor Design Assumption

       Aliens of Gold has one major design assumption. The commercial game
       uses 11 floors in each mission (although there are more available -
       see Appendix for details). All floors are assumed to be part of the
       same structure (which is square). All but floor #0, (the
       basement/1st secret floor) must have an elevator.

       There's a single elevator shaft which connects all floors, hence
       the ELEVATOR MUST BE IN THE SAME RELATIVE POSITION ON EACH FLOOR.
       (The design of the elevator controls enable Stone to return to any
       previously completed level without having to stop at all the floors
       between the floor he is on and the one where he wants to go).

       Further, Blake Stone must start each floor from an elevator except
       Floor #1 where his starting position is designated by a Start
       Position code. NOTE: If more than one Start Position code appears
       on the 1st floor, the last one sensed by Mapedit is used.

       Floor Codes

       Designers of Wolf3D and SoD levels frequently had problems
       understanding the use of floor codes and how to assign them. Those
       problems have been virtually eliminated in the Blake Stone engine.
       In WOLF3D and SoD it was a no-no to mix different floor codes in
       the same open area, which often resulted in having guards standing
       around as statues and taking no action. All floor codes had to be
                                      -4-
       
       isolated from one another by walls and doors. The opening of a door
       was a signal for guards to become active if a shot were heard or
       the enemy was seen (unless a guard was marked as being "deaf" -
       more on this later).

       With the new engine, guards immediately swing into action as soon
       as Blake moves onto the same floor code they are on (and they can
       either see him or hear him) without needing a door to open.
       (Opening a door and firing a shot into an area with a different
       floor code still alerts guards within).

       However, since you probably don't want to alert an entire floor on
       the first shot, the level should be broken down into unique
       "codes".  Floor codes (for those of you who don't know) are used to
       isolate areas of the overall floor from one another such that enemy
       guards can be made to engage in a fight or not, depending on how
       you assign floor codes. This does not mean, for example, that in an
       area that is 5 squares by 5 squares, you would use 25 different
       codes - a single floor code for the entire 25 squares would be the
       norm. And every square that is not a wall or door should have a
       floor code - never leave any squares unassigned.

       In Blake Stone, there are more than enough unique floor codes to
       handle the most complex designs. In fact there are 2 complete sets
       of nearly identical floor codes. One set (codes 6c through 98) are
       to be used in all the exposed areas of the floor and the remainder
       (a2 through ce) are to be used in all the hidden areas. This
       ensures that the Automap will display the correct shades of green
       in the appropriate areas.

       The overlapping function of the 2 sets of floor codes refers
       to the fact that except for Automap concerns, any guard that
       becomes aware of Stone while on floor code 6d, for example, will
       cause any guards on floor code a3 to go into Attack mode the same
       as if they were standing on floor code 6d.

       In general there are 3 approaches to assigning floor codes:

       1) Assign a single floor code to all floor space. Unless you take
       other measures, this will have the singular effect of alerting
       every guard on the floor as soon as the first shot is fired. This
       can lead to some interesting confrontations, but such a design is
       considered undesireable as the action will usually end quickly and
       not favorably for Blake. Even if he survives, there's nothing left
       to do except go from one empty room to another.

       2) Assign a unique code to each individual room. In this scenario
       guards in the next room are unaware of any carnage in the current
       room  - unless something causes the door between the rooms to open.

       3) Assign unique codes to contiguous or non-contiguous groups of
       rooms. This offers a microcosm of approach number 1) above, but is
                                      -5-
       
       more controlled and often the most interesting and suspenseful
       strategy.

       Special Floor Code '6a'

       There are a few floor codes that produce a special effect on the
       enemy characters. One of these is code '6a', called the "deaf-
       guard" code.  Such a designation means 2 things: the guard will not
       react to shots being fired in the area until and unless he sees
       Blake, then he responds just like any other guard. But his eyesight
       is much better than other guards as he can see in every direction
       (that isn't blocked by something) including one square behind. A
       "deaf" guard can even see between the cracks of wall cubes that are
       joined only at the corners. (It's kind of eerie to hear a guard
       sound off that can't be seen anywhere). By contrast, guards on all
       other floor codes can only see straight ahead but will be alerted
       regardless of their impaired vision after the first shot is fired
       on the same floor code.

       Hidden Doors (or Push Walls) and Floor Codes '6c' and 'a2'

       There are a some restrictions concerning hidden doors (or push
       walls if you prefer). A push wall must have a regular wall on both
       sides of it. Neither side can be open or the game will abort. And
       neither of the walls on either side of the push wall can be another
       push wall. The error codes at abort time are 83:09 and 83:0C.

       It has been a common practice in WOLF3D and SoD to use one push-
       wall next to another to create a "one-way" push wall. You can
       accomplish the same thing in Blake Stone by using a dripping
       ceiling vent in place of a blocking push wall.

       Next, enemies on the other side of the wall should not be allowed
       to block the path of the sliding wall. (No game abort here).

       In Wolf3D and SoD, if enemies are in the room behind a push wall,
       they must be made "deaf" guards so they don't react before the door
       is opened. This isn't necessary in Blake Stone. There are a couple
       of special floor codes that can be used to keep the actors away
       from the area where the wall will slide open. These are codes
       '6c' and 'a2' - they both do the same thing. An enemy will not move
       directly across one of the "blocking codes" and therefore will not
       be able to impede the hidden door's progress as it slides open.

       All push walls move a maximum of 2 cells and stop. If a push wall
       fails to move, or moves only one cell, then something is blocking
       it. Besides the obvious, "dripping" ceiling vents will block push
       walls. (If push walls stop on another hidden door code, they can be
       pushed another 2 cells in any direction open to them). "Blocking"
       codes are placed along the path of the sliding wall, as needed.



                                       -6-
       
       IMPORTANT NOTE: Even though there is a "blocking code" on the floor
       leading into and out of the room, any guard within will still be
       able to exit unless there's also a blocking code outside the door
       or on either side of the path used by the push wall.

       There are several other uses for the "blocking" floor codes which
       are discussed later on.

       "Moving" Human Guards

       If you place a "moving" guard on a floor, he will move by himself
       in the assigned direction until he comes to a solid object. He will
       then turn and continue to move in another direction. He will never
       be stopped even if he has to turn 180 degrees and retrace his path.

       Since it is generally unpredictable where a guard will be who moves
       by himself, it is sometimes useful to provide direction and a
       predetermined path. If a moving guard is provided with a path and
       a direction, but runs into something such as another guard, he will
       move off on his own and be directionless unless he moves across a
       directional arrow somewhere. Then he will function as he did before
       he veered off the path. Guards can be made to move through doors to
       adjoining rooms with or without the same floor codes. This can
       provide a measure of surprise.

       Actions of the Enemy in Attack Mode

       Aliens and Mutants never move about until they switch to Attack
       mode.

       Attacking enemies will mostly move to the vector where Stone is
       currently located. They can go through any door - locked or not -
       except hidden doors. They will often choose an alternate route, if
       one is available and come at Stone from another direction. Their
       progress in locating him can be slowed and often stopped by
       complicated room patterns; by putting solid objects (tables, etc.)
       in their way that they have to move around; or by sheer distance.
       They can be absolutely stopped by the strategic placement of
       blocking codes on the floor. This, of course, forces Stone to go TO
       the enemy and engage him on his home ground, so to speak.

       Human guards on the attack will sometimes move away from an
       immediate threat by going into other rooms. Often they will return,
       but sometimes not. Those who do not will wait to ambush Stone if he
       comes looking for them.

       Non-human enemies never run from Stone.

       The other thing about guards moving from room to room while
       searching is that they will sometimes open a door into an unrelated
       floor code and if a shot is fired at the time the door is open,
       even more enemies can switch to Attack mode.
                                      -7-
       
       Other Uses for "Blocking" Floor Codes

       In addition to the uses for Blocking floor codes mentioned earlier
       in this text, it is sometimes desireable to restrict the random
       movement of some types of "enemies". The Electro Spheres are one
       example.  You can select spheres that either move E/W, N/S or
       diagonally. Spheres that move diagonally appear to move in a random
       pattern as they bounce off walls and other solid objects.

       You can limit the apparent random movement of these spheres by
       placing blocking codes on both sides of them, in effect creating a
       transparent corridor in which their movement is restricted. One
       example of usage is the placement of spheres on the other side of
       a door that Stone will eventually open. By putting blocking codes
       on both sides of the diagonal spheres, they cannot move freely
       until the door is opened, at which time they are released through
       the open doorway. If you place an Electro Sphere directly on a
       blocking code, it will not move at all. When used sparingly, this
       will cause Stone to hesitate when he encounters one.

       You can also place "moving" Perscan Drones and Volatile Tranports
       on blocking codes. This has the effect of causing the object to
       spin in one spot without being able to move away.

       Access Card Placement

       An Access card object code must be placed in 2 locations. First,
       place it on a door that is to be locked. (Doors are normally
       unlocked unless an Access card is placed on them). Second, place
       the same Access code elsewhere where Stone can find the card.

       Red & Gold Access Cards and Mission Endings

       The Red Access Card is used to unlock the elevator on each floor so
       the next floor becomes accessible. In the commercial game, Gold
       access cards must be obtained from both Dr. Goldfire and the Super
       Boss on level 9 of each mission before Blake can end the mission.
       The super bosses from mission 1 to 6, respectively, are the Spider
       Mutant, Acid Dragon, Breather Beast, Cyborg Warrior, Bio-Mech
       Guardian and the Reptilian Warrior. A mission then ends when Blake
       walks toward the Shuttle Bay and crosses a Terminate Mission floor
       code. Mission 6 is different. Stone must destroy 10 Projection
       Generators in level 9. When the 10th generator is destroyed, the
       mission and game will be complete.

       Special Large Hex Value (LHV) Object Codes

       Blake Stone has a number of new features (see list below). These
       features are implemented using Large Hex Value (LHV) OBJECT codes
       that all begin with Fxxx. It isn't normally necessary to know what
       all the individual codes mean when designing/debugging a floor.


                                      -8-
       
       However, they are all listed in the Appendix of this document for
       you to reference as required.

       MAPEDIT provides the means to implement all the special features of
       Blake Stone without having to know what the LHV Object codes are.

       All graphic objects that are viewable when playing the game are the
       result of object codes ranging from 0001 to 0255. The new LHV
       object codes do not produce anything visible on the game screen but
       are used for controlling a number of useful features.  MAPEDIT.DOC
       explains how to implement each feature. This document explains only
       what the features are. They are used to control:

       Food Units
       Automatic opening doors
       Teleporter destinations
       Raising & lowering barriers
       Bio-tech message assignments
       Time delays
       Ceiling and floor textures
       Ceiling and floor colors

       Each of these features are explained below.

       Food Units

       Food Units come in 2 types, depending on what they dispense. One
       type (Food Unit 1) dispenses beverages and the other (Food Unit 2),
       solid food. (The latter improves Stone's health slightly more than
       the former). Also, a Food Unit can have varying amounts of food in
       it, including none at all, or it can be "out of order".

       Automatic Doors

       Any door, including locked doors, can be made to open automatically
       by creating "hot spots" or sensors on the floor. And several doors
       can be made to appear to open at the same time. It takes 2 things
       to accomplish this: a special floor code and a map coordinate which
       must rest on the special floor code.

       Door Linkages

       Whether a door opens automatically or not, any door can be linked
       to another door in such a way that all linked doors appear to open
       at the same time.

       NOTE: Where a door appears on the map, there is no need for a floor
       code; the two codes are mutually exclusive.





                                      -9-
       
       Teleporters

       There are two classes of Teleporters: those which transport Stone
       to another location within the same (local) floor and those which
       transport him to the secret floor at level 0 and back (in the
       commercial game).

       Local Teleporting

       Both the sending Teleporter and the receiving location (not
       necessarily another Teleporter) should be located in walls that
       face the same direction. For example, if a sending Teleporter is in
       a West wall, then the receiving location should also be at a West
       wall. This is to ensure that Stone will always be facing out when
       he arrives at the receiving location.

       Distant Teleporting

       In general, the same rules apply for Teleporting to distant levels
       as to the current floor, as far as position of the Teleporter and
       receiving location is concerned. Beyond this the receiving location
       must be located at the same absolute coordinates in the distant
       floor as in the "sending" floor. In addition you must use a Start
       Position object code at the receiving end and place it on the
       receiving position. (If you omit the Start Position code, Stone
       will end up at X/Y coordinate 0:0).

       Teleporting to Non-Secret Floors

       Teleporting to a distant floor in the commercial game is limited to
       going to a secret floor (the basement) in each mission. Being able
       to teleport to any other floor is possible when using MAPEDIT. But
       you should be aware of the consequences of doing this.

       Teleporting Ahead or Back

       Each non-secret floor has a Red Access card somewhere that is used
       to unlock the next floor above the current one after Stone enters
       the elevator and is ready to ascend. If you install a Teleporter to
       take Stone to a distant floor ahead (or back) of the one he is in
       AND he is allowed to access the entire floor, it defeats the
       purpose of locating and using the Red Access card to unlock the
       target floor.  (It should be noted that using the elevator to
       ascend to the next floor also causes the score for the current
       floor to be recorded).

       Having stated the above, if you want to design a floor that has 2
       or more individual and inaccessible (to each other) sections, then
       using a Teleporter to enter these individual sections from a
       distant floor would probably be an interesting design. Designs of
       this nature may be slightly more difficult to assemble because of


                                     -10-
       
       the rule that Teleporters and receiving locations have to be at the
       same absolute coordinates in the sending and receiving floors.

       Use of Access Cards

       You need to remember that any Access card that Stone picks up is
       retained until he uses it somewhere. If you teleport Stone to a
       distant floor and have him use an Access Card that he obtained
       before he got to the distant floor, be sure there's a way to
       replace it if it will be needed back on the sending floor. Also
       remember that only one Access card of any color can be retained.

       Barriers and Barrier Switches

       This section applies to both types of barriers (Post and Arc) used
       in the game. Whenever you set up a barrier, you would normally
       place a barrier switch somewhere to raise (turn on) or lower (turn
       off) the barrier.

       Switches can operate barriers on either the current floor, or on a
       distant floor in the same mission.

       NOTE: All adjacent barrier objects will switch on or off along with
       the targeted object of the switch. Also note that you are limited
       to 5 unique barrier coordinates per floor. This doesn't preclude
       having multiple barrier switches pointing to the same coordinates.
       Some of you may have noticed that in the original Blake Stone game,
       all barrier switches are positioned in such a way that the player
       can never see the target barrier going up or down. There is no
       technical reason for this, only a design decision.

       Random Behavior of Aliens & Mutants (Time Delays)

       A few of the non-human creatures in Blake Stone can be controlled
       to some extent by adding delay times to influence their behavior.

       The first of these is the Pod Alien. Without any action taken by
       the floor designer, Pods normally start "hatching" in a sequential
       manner controlled by the engine and the skill level at which the
       game is being played (skill level 4 Pods will not activate when
       playing the game at a lesser skill level, for example). To speed up
       the activation process (or delay it), an LHV delay code can be
       used.

       The same type of delaying action can also be applied to the Mutant
       Guards (the ones lying under bloody sheets on tables).

       Finally, the time delay code can be used to control the release
       rate of the Plasma Aliens out of the High Energy Plasma Alien wall
       socket.



                                     -11-
       
       BIO-Techs and Messages

       There are two kinds of Bio-Techs: Informants who want to help
       Stone, and Loyalists (loyal to Goldfire) who are enemies of Stone.
       Each type of Bio-Tech is capable of delivering a message to Stone.
       Which Bio-Tech is an Informant, and which is not, is determined by
       the game at runtime. The messages they will deliver are assigned at
       this time also. (When Stone is killed, and restarts the level, all
       Bio-techs are reassigned).

       The messages each type of Bio-Tech delivers is controlled by an LHV
       code. Some messages are delivered only by Informants. Others are
       delivered by Loyalists. Loyalist Bio-techs deliver 2 types of
       messages: Warnings and Alarms. The difference between the 2 types
       is what happens when Stone tries to interrogate an unfriendly Bio-
       tech. If the Loyalist issues a Warning message upon being
       interrogated by Stone, Stone will have one chance to kill him right
       away. If Stone attempts to interrogate the same guy a 2nd time, the
       Bio-Tech will enter "Attack Mode".

       When a Bio-Tech issues an "alarm" type message, the guy delivering
       it will immediately go into Attack mode. There will be no 2nd
       chance. A list of all the codes and the messages associated with
       them appears in an Appendix at the end of this document.

       Floor & Ceiling Texture Selection

       Every floor can have a different set of floor and ceiling textures.
       There are currently 32 different textures from which to select.
       Once selected, they remain the same over the entire floor and
       cannot be modified.

       Floor & Ceiling Colors

       Make sure you always assign default floor and ceiling colors even
       if you never turn the textures off yourself. If you distribute your
       levels, someone else may try to use them without having the
       textures turned on. This will result in all levels having black
       floors and ceilings.

       If ceiling and/or floor textures are turned off, the colors that
       appear in their place can be controlled beyond the default
       selection. The selection of colors can be changed while a floor is
       being played by placing appropriate codes at selected locations
       around the floor. In general, any color changes made should have a
       pair of codes inserted together in such a way that as Stone moves
       from room to room, for example, a ceiling color would change to a
       different color going in one direction and change back to the
       original color when returning to the original room. A short hallway
       inserted between 2 rooms is a good spot to insert color changes.



                                     -12-
       
       Secret Floors

       There are 2 secret floors per mission in the commercial version of
       Blake Stone. One of the floors is always level 0 (or the basement)
       and can only be entered via a teleporter - usually hidden somewhere
       - from any other floor in the same mission. After completing this
       secret floor, the teleporter must always return Stone to the floor
       from which he was originally teleported (see Teleporters).

       The other "secret" floor is the 10th floor and is always entered
       via the elevator from the 9th floor (after a Red Access Card is
       located by Stone. This card is usually hidden somewhere on the 9th
       level). When the 10th floor is completed, Stone must return to the
       9th floor to complete the mission.

       Elevators

       Apart from the need for all elevators to be located in the same
       relative position on all floors of the same mission, it is a good
       idea to fill the elevator with "blocking codes" ('6c') as well as
       one square outside the elevator door. This provides the one safe
       haven on the whole floor for Stone. He won't be safe from shots
       fired into the elevator when the door is open, but when the door is
       closed he will be.

       Another aspect of elevators is that one of the walls that makes up
       an elevator has the elevator controls on it, but ONLY on the
       East/West sides of the wall. The North/South side of the same wall
       carries the "S" insignia.  This means that the placement of the
       wall with the controls on it is important. In the commercial game
       all elevators are oriented East/West so the controls will be in the
       standard location within the elevator where you would normally
       expect to see them. There are also "elevator facades" available
       which are used to hide the elevator controls on the outside of the
       elevator room.

       Positioning GoldFire

       Goldfire's appearance is triggered when Stone moves onto the same
       floor code as a Goldfire site AND Stone comes into the line-of-
       sight of Goldfire AND crosses his line-of-site at an angle
       (approaching and leaving a Goldfire site from the major compass
       points of North, East, South or West will not trigger his
       appearance). If there are places in a room where Stone can
       potentially get by Goldfire without coming into his line-of-sight,
       and you don't want Stone to get out of the room without Goldfire
       appearing, then place other Goldfire sites at strategic locations
       in the same room (only one Goldfire appearance will occur at a time
       on a floor with multiple sites laid out).

       Floor 9 of Mission 6 in the original game provides an example of
       how Stone can enter a room where a Goldfire site is and not trigger
       his appearance.  If Stone walks straight ahead to the opposite end
       of the room from the door and turns back around and walks straight
       out without veering more than one square to the left or right,
       Goldfire will not appear.

       Floor 9 of Mission 5 is another example. If Stone enters through
       the south door of the room where Goldfire will appear and walks
       straight ahead (after dealing with any ceiling turrets and other
       enemies first) as far as he can go, then turns directly to the west
       and leaves through the west door, Goldfire will not appear (the
       Goldfire site in this room is located just one square away from
       Stone's path). On the other hand, if Stone should be tempted to
       enter the room via the Teleporter, Goldfire will appear almost
       immediately.

       Goldfire, when he appears, always starts to walk east if there
       isn't a wall directly in front of him (if so, he immediately turns
       south).

       Goldfire will not cross any blocking codes, but will shoot across
       them if Stone is visible (the same as any other enemy).

       NOTE: You are limited to a maximum of 10 Goldfire sites per floor.

       Balance

       When designing a floor, you should strive to achieve a balance
       among the various skill levels. For example, don't overload with
       skill 1 & 2 guards, nor fail to add skill level 4 guards. MAPEDIT
       allows you to quickly see not only what the balance looks like from
       the STATS, but you can individually view the placement of all skill
       level guards. Plus you can isolate the display of treasure, ammo,
       and health items, and Super guards (bosses).




                                     -14-
       
       Weapons

       Stone begins each mission with only an Auto Charge Pistol (ACP).
       For him to get more powerful weapons he needs to either find one
       somewhere that has been left for his use by a kindly designer, or
       he must kill to get one. Sector Patrol guards carry Slow Fire
       Protector (SFP) pistols. Each such guard who is killed will drop
       his to be picked up by Stone. After he picks one up, no more
       pistols will be dropped. (Extra weapons translate to extra ammo).

       Star Sentinels and Star Troopers carry Rapid Assault Weapons (RAW).
       The first guard of the above type who is killed will drop his RAW
       and Stone can pick it up.

       The only way for Stone to obtain either the Dual Neutron Disruptor
       (DND) or the Plasma Discharge Unit (PDU) is for the designer to
       leave these here and there. (All weapons except the ACP can be
       distributed in explodable cargo crates, as well as being left out
       in the open).

       Since Stone can be killed on any floor in any mission, it's usually
       a good idea to place the more powerful weapons on each floor. (Some
       people simply fail to remember to Save their game at the start of
       each level).

       MAPDATA (Choosing Walls)

       Blake Stone has many walls and doors to choose from when creating
       a design. Many of these are difficult to describe. To aid you in
       choosing a wall or door type, there's a way to view each one
       individually, then cross-reference it to the symbol used in the
       Mapdata Legend Window.

       To view the graphic of each wall/door type, you must start Blake
       Stone in Debug Mode. See the Appendix below for the how to do this.
       Start any Mission and when you are ready to play, use Bksp+D to
       make Blake invisible so he won't be bothered by the actors. Then
       press Bksp+T to view the first graphic image.

       Each image has a Page # associated with it (top line). Use the
       right and left arrow keys to scroll forward/backward through the
       images. If the first several images do not display then press Esc
       to erase the graphic and Warp (Bksp+W) to the next level. After
       getting there, press Bksp+T once again and all pages should have an
       image on them. Every image has two views: N/S (even page number)
       and E/W (odd page number). The E/W view is also shaded.

       Now scroll through all the images and select the one(s) you want to
       use. Write down the page number with a brief description of what
       the image looks like to you.

       Now quit the game and start Mapedit. The Legend Window with Mapdata
       will be visible when Mapedit is ready. Scroll the Legend window to
       the right until you see a column of number pairs. Each pair of
       numbers represents the page numbers (even/odd) of the images of
       walls and doors. Check the list you made and find the number(s)
       you're looking for in the list on the screen. The symbol to the
       left of the number (at the beginning of the line) together with the
       brief description on the same line represents the wall/door you
       want to use.

       Alternatively, you can print a copy of MAPDATA.XXX to have in front
       of you so you won't have to scroll the Legend window.















                                     -16-
       
       OBJECT DATA Types

       Any floor used in Blake Stone consists of 2 types of data: Map data
       (which is floors, walls, and doors) and Object data (everything
       else). Object data is further defined as being either Static (it
       doesn't move) or Active (it does move). Active Objects (Actives)
       consist mainly of the actors (guards). However, there are a few
       other objects that are considered active:

       Barriers (each barrier object equals one Active object)
       Bio Toxic Waste
       Dripping Ceiling Vents
       Failing Lights
       Plasma Balls* (from PDU) and their explosions*
       Smoking Floor Grates
       Projection Generators
       Toxic Sludge
       Weapon Sensor Warning Lights

       Blake Stone permits a maximum of 149 Active Objects on one floor.
       The MAPEDIT program monitors this and will alert the designer if
       the maximum of 149 is exceeded. (399 is the maximum Static Objects
       permitted).

       *Plasma balls are the result of firing the PDU. As the balls fly
       toward their target and ultimately explode, both the balls and
       explosions become temporary Actives. If the number of Actives is
       already 149 or close to it, the PDU will begin to malfunction (it
       won't fire). The player will be alerted to this condition by a
       warning message appearing in the lower left corner of the game
       screen.

       This is a condition that can occur when playing the game at Skill
       level 4 (Veteran Agent) when all available guards are on the floor.
       (It presents an extra challenge for the Skill level 4 player).

       The only way to relieve this condition when the game is in action
       is for Stone to dispose of some guards (actors) using other weapons
       in his inventory until the number of Actives is reduced enough for
       the PDU to function normally again.

       The Automap & Leaking Walls

       When testing a floor that you've created, it is recommended that
       you view the Automap closely as you go from room to room. The
       Automap should display only the rooms (or parts of rooms) that
       Stone has viewed. If you should see a splash of color that has
       apparently "leaked" off into an adjoining area of the floor that
       Stone hasn't entered, it is probably caused by the joining of walls
       at their corners to make an angled wall. To eliminate the color
       leakage, the walls joined at corners must have the corners filled


                                     -17-
       
       in on one side or the other with added wall cubes so there are no
       "leaking" corners.

       New Features of Blake Stone: Planet Strike

       Planet Strike is similar in most aspects to Aliens of Gold.
       However, a number of new features, both cosmetic and active, have
       been added. These are listed below.

       1)  1 episode: 20 regular floors (0-19), 4 bonus floors (20-23)
       2)  No elevators are used; just transporters
       3)  New uniforms and language for all actors
       4)  Some new Aliens
       5)  One new weapon (most powerful)
       6)  Morphing capability for some actors
       7)  Automap zoom to help locate pushwalls
       8)  Fewer access key cards
       9)  Ability to activate guards before Blake gets to them
       10) Invisibility cloaks for guards and aliens
       11) Switches, Doors, and Guards activated when guards/aliens killed
       12) Easier to enable Debug Mode
       13) Most features of Aliens of Gold are available in Planet Strike
       14) Planet Strike features are not available in Aliens of Gold
       15) Floor sensors to activate switches
       16) Fission Detonator required to destroy Security Cube
       17) New types of "barriers".

       Invisibility Cloaks

       Virtually any guard or alien can be made nearly invisible by the
       application of one of two map data codes - '4E' or '50'. These
       codes are inserted at the spot where the guard is placed on the
       map. The actor can be stationary or moving.




















                                     -18-
       
       Morphing

       Several Aliens are capable of morphing from an inanimate object to
       their true form. These are shown in the Object data Legend as
       "Morphing" creatures. NOTE: Dr. Goldfire is a morphing creature
       ONLY in the final level (19). There is a special Goldfire code for
       this. Use of this code in any other level will not produce a
       morphing Goldfire.

       Activating Guards Early

       Normally, all actors become activated - go into "Attack Mode" -
       when one or two conditions are met. First, Stone would have to be
       standing or moving on the same floor code as an actor AND the actor
       would have to see him or hear a shot fired by Stone. Some actors
       are declared "deaf" by the use of floor code '6A'. So-called "deaf"
       actors do not react to shots being fired by Stone. They react only
       when they actually see Stone. This allows them to hide somewhere
       and ambush Stone unexpectedly.

       In Planet Strike, guards can have their status switched to Attack
       Mode by the use of a floor sensor. This sensor is the same one used
       to cause doors to open automatically and was named the "Auto-Door
       Hot-Spot" code (its name has been modified to reflect the change in
       its used in Planet Strike). When the sensor is pointed at a guard
       instead of a door, the guard switches to "Attack Mode" if he is
       non-deaf. If he is a "deaf" guard, his deafness is "cured" and he
       becomes a normal guard. Neither guard/alien is required to be on
       the same floor code as Blake.

       Barrier Activation

       All operable barriers (non-operable barriers are called Barricades)
       are activated by a switch somewhere. The switch can be turned on or
       turned off. (In Planet Strike, while most switches are placed in
       inaccessible locations, they don't have to be hidden). The switch
       is activated remotely in one of two ways: use of a floor sensor or
       the killing of a selected guard.

       Using the floor sensor method, you use a special floor code as the
       sensor and place an LHV (map coordinate) on top of each sensor that
       points to the switch. The switch can be located anywhere on the
       floor, but is usually imbedded in a wall close by or some other
       inaccessible location. The chosen floor code (009F for switch "on"
       or 00A0 for switch "off") then operates the switch when Blake walks
       over it. The switch has another LHV placed on top of it and points
       to the barrier that it (the switch) controls.

       The second method for operating a switch is to mark any actor with
       a map code (004F) that designates the actor as the "holder" of the
       switch "key". An LHV (map coordinate) that points to the barrier

                                     -19-
       
       switch, must be located adjacent to the actor (to his right).
       Again, the barrier switch has another LHV coordinate placed on it
       which points to the barrier to be activated. When the selected
       actor is killed, the switch position is changed and the target
       barrier is operated.

       NOTE: this feature can also be used to open doors or activate
       enemies. Mapedit will handle proper placement of the LHV in each
       situation.

       Fission Detonator

       A Fission Detonator (along with a Security Cube) must be used on
       every floor (except the last or a bonus floor). In addition to
       being positioned as a discrete object somewhere on a level, the
       detonator can alternately be carried by an actor by using map code
       004D where the actor is standing. When the actor is killed, he will
       drop the detonator for Blake to retrieve.

       LHV Use

       There's change with respect to where LHV's are inserted in Planet
       Strike. This change was mentioned above in the explanation of
       barrier switches. That is, an LHV coordinate is placed is the same
       cell as the switch; there is no need to have 'F8FF' placed on top
       of the switch, as in Aliens of Gold.

                                    APPENDIX

       This Appendix provides other information about Blake Stone that may
       help you while creating/editing/debugging floors. You will also
       find the meanings of all the LHV (Large Hex Value) codes and what
       all the Debug codes mean.

       As you know, there are 6 missions in Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold,
       with 11 playable levels per mission in the commercial game.
       However, in reality, there are a total of 90 levels in the entire
       game. The first 11 levels (0 to 10) of each mission are the ones
       you can play. Levels 11 thru 14 are hidden and may be used as extra
       secret levels that Stone can teleport to and from. The commercial
       Blake Stone game does provide access to these levels during play.
       If you don't wish to use one or more of them as secret floors, you
       can use them as a place to put untested levels. MAPEDIT will let
       you get to them if you want. To test them, you will have to
       exchange them with one of the levels marked 0 to 10, or treat them
       as secret floors to which you teleport to from any of the regular
       eleven floors. They cannot be warped to in Debug mode.

       Bio-Tech Message Codes

       The following codes are used in conjunction with an 'F1' code.
       These LHV codes provide the messages used by INFORMANTS only. The
       format of the code is: F1xx where 'xx' is one of the codes listed
       below.

       Please note that the message content itself cannot be modified.
       Also note that if you choose not to use any Bio-tech messages,
       Stone will not be able to separate informants from enemies.
       (Killing all Bio-techs to be on the "safe side" deprives a player
       of several bonuses!)

       Informant Message (F1) numbers:

       Teleporters

       F4nn - 'nn' is the level to teleport to.

       F400 - teleports to level 0 or basement (1st secret floor)

       F500 ccrr  - used to teleport within the same floor.

       F500 2114

                    receiving teleporter.

       Barriers and Barrier Switches

       F8FF ccrr - used to control a barrier on the same floor. (AOG only)
       -----^^^^ = col,row coordinate of a barrier object.

       F8nn ccrr - used to control a barrier on a different floor.
       --^^ ^^^^ = level and col/row coordinates of barrier object.

       Time Delays

       FAtt - used to delay or speed up the release of Pod Aliens, Mutant
              Guards and High Energy Plasma Aliens. 'tt' is a number from
              00 to ??. The smaller the number, the smaller the delay. A
              value of '00' equals virtually zero delay. Place this LHV
              code immediately following the Pods or Mutant Guard tables.
              For High Energy Plasma Aliens, place code on Wall Socket.

       Ceiling and Floor Texture Codes

       To assign ceiling and floor texture codes you use FB00 xxxx:

       FB00 04 01
       -----^^       =  Ceiling value

       FB00 04 01
       --------^^    =  Floor value

       FB00 0401     =  Small brown squares on ceiling and large dark
                        squares on floor.

       Codes:

       01 - Large dark squares (default if FB00 code is omitted)
       02 - Small medium grey squares
       03 - Small dark grey squares
       04 - Small brown squares
       05 - Small blue squares
       06 - Circles (black)
       07 - Small squares with Cyan outline
       08 - Stone blocks
       09 - Circle with connecting lines
       0A - Rectangles
       0B - Large dark hexagonal pattern
       0C - Square with an X
       0D - Rectangle (light grey)
       0E - Square with X and blue lines
       0F - Square with Olive center
       10 - Square pattern with connecting lines
       11 - Large square with Cyan corners
       12 - Large dark squares w/magenta corner lines
       13 - Magenta squares
       14 - Grey brick pattern
       15 - Small squares with brown outline
       16 - Small squares with red outline
       17 - Grey recessed hex pattern
       18 - Small hex w/green outline & connecting lines
       19 - Cyan squares
       1A - Small Olive squares
       1B - Small Cyan squares
       1C - Large blue circles
       1D - Large Cyan circles
       1E - Blue brick pattern
       1F - Olive brick pattern
       20 - Red recessed hex pattern

       Any codes used above number 20 will result in the use of wall
       texture patterns being placed on the floor and/or ceiling. The
       highest number you an legally use without incurring an error is


                                     -24-
       
       '4C'. There are Debug codes which can help you assess all the
       textures that are available. See Debug codes below.

       Food Units

       FCnn - used to denote an operating Food Unit.
       --^^ = # of items to be dispensed. 00 = empty.

       FDnn - used to denote an out-of-order Food Unit
              'nn' can be any value.

       Note: No more than 15 Food Unit can be used per floor.

       Ceiling and Floor Color Codes

       To assign ceiling and floor colors (textures disabled), use the
       codes listed below. The list is a guideline of color shades
       associated with a category number.  The higher the number in each
       category, the brighter the shade. For example, in category 10, the
       numbers 11, 12, and 13 represent darker shades of red. The lowest
       number in each category almost always looks black, while the
       highest number looks white. The names of the shades listed are a
       best guess. In the commercial game, in almost every case the lower
       numbers in each category have been used to avoid harsh and brightly
       colored ceilings and floors. In fact, all floor colors used some
       shade of gray (09, 0A, and 0B).

       It should be noted that not all numbers (0 thru F) in each category
       produce something other than black.

       To get a better idea of what shades you are dealing with and which
       ones you might wish to use, start the game in Debug Mode and use
       Bksp+M to display the Memory window. At the bottom of the memory
       window is one line which displays the ceiling and floor texture
       numbers (in decimal) - or color numbers if textures are turned off
       - for the current level. Look at the ceilings and floors of several
       different levels to locate something that you might want to use in
       your game. Jot down the decimal numbers and convert them to
       hexadecimal so they can be assigned on the floor you're creating.

       NOTE: If you place FE00 ccff anywhere on the floor except the
       initial location at [0,0], then Stone must walk over the code
       before it takes effect.

       Category    Color Shades
       00          Gray
       10          Reds
       20          Browns/Golds
       30          Olive Greens
       40          Light Greens

       Debugging Codes

       Often referred to as Cheat codes by those who will probably never
       use them for any other purpose, these codes can help you when
       debugging any level in any mission. To enter Debug Mode, you must
       be using Version 2.0 (Version 1.0 does not have this capability)
       and start the game with the command BSTONE POWERBALL. At the screen
       where the JAM PRODUCTIONS logo comes up, wait for the white
       lettering to start to come up underneath the logo, then press and
       hold down both Shift keys until you hear a Ka-ching sound which
       indicates that Debug mode is now in force.

       All the following debug keys require the use of the backspace key
       being held down while one of the debug keys is pressed.

       6+7 - Collect all bonus items (gold, loot, Xylan Orbs, $ bags)
       7+8 - Kill all actors
       6+8 - Collect all bonus items AND kill all actors.

       A - Add actors to Automap (tiny spots are not recognizable)
       B - Border Color
       C - Stats
       D - Player Invisible     (Some actors will sense Stone's presence,
                                 but will not shoot). Toggles on/off.
       E - End Mission with Win
       F - Facing Spot          (row/col coordinates of where Stone is)
       G - God mode             (Toggles on/off)
       H - Hurt yourself        (if not in God mode - deducts 1 health pt)
       I - Item                 (Each use provides the next powerful gun)
       M - Memory Info          (Provides ceiling/floor texture/color #'s)
       Q - Fast Quit            (Returns to DOS right now)
       O - Show Push Walls on Automapper
       U - Unlocks all floors   (Access Key cards are not needed)
       S - Slow Motion          (toggles on/off)
       T -  (Pops up a window which displays graphics and sounds from the
            game. Use the left/right arrow keys to page through the
            entries.  Don't stop at blank entries. ESC exits. Images
            include all walls, doors, sprites [objects], and sounds.
            Each entry  displayed has a unique page number).
       V - Extra VBLS           (????)
       W - Warp to level        (Shift+W warps to next default level)

       HOME - Decrement sky shading (if ceiling texture off)
              Decrement ceiling choice (if texture on)
       PGUP - Increment sky shading (if ceiling texture off)
              Increment ceiling choice (if texture on)
        END - Decrement ground color (if floor texture is off)
              Decrement floor choice (if texture is on)
       PGDN - Increment ground color (if floor texture is off)
            - Increment floor choice (if texture is on)
