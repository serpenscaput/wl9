                           Sample Floor

Blake Stone contains a number of features not found in either of its very
successful predecessors - Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny. The document BSTONE.DOC
explains what each of these new features is, but there's nothing like being
able to see how they are laid out on a map in MAPEDIT. For this we have
prepared a sample floor for you to view while reading the explanations for
these features in BSTONE.DOC. After viewing the sample floor, you may want
to take a look at some of the floors of the real Blake Stone levels to see
if you can decipher what is going on in each level. When you start MAPEDIT,
you'll need to press the 'L' hot-key to be sure all the LHV codes show up
(they are displayed as square white blocks with a red center).

While the sample floor is "playable", it offers no challenges and is almost
completely bare of any of the usual "amenities" found on a real Blake Stone
floor. But you may find it helpful to import the sample floor and walk through
it to see what happens. IMPORTANT: Be sure to save the floor on the level you
use to import the Sample floor BEFORE importing.

The following features have been implemented in the sample floor:

1) Automatic doors
2) Multiply linked doors
3) Barriers and barrier switches
4) Teleporters
5) Time delays on Smart guards (Alien pods and Plasma generators)
6) Bio-Techs and how and where they get their messages
7) Food units.
8) Ceiling/Floor texture implementation
9) Ceiling/Floor color implementation
10) The use of Guard Blocking codes

Once you understand how the above are implemented, other features should not
be a problem for you.

In column 2 of the sample floor you will see an example of what happens when
storing LHV coordinates somewhere in the first 3 columns of the map. In this
case, coordinates were use to link several doors together. Both MAPEDIT and the
Blake Stone game will be confused by this. See page 23 of MAPEDIT.DOC for an
explanation of what has happened here.

A map of the floor can be printed to assist you through it. The map file is
named SAMPLE.PRT. Just use a DOS copy command to print it.
