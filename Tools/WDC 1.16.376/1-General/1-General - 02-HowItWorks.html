General :: How It Works

It is important to note that while you are working on a project you NEVER look at 
the compiled data files.
You are always looking at the original data files along with the actual files you 
have inserted.
<BR><BR>

OK, this isn't entirely true.
The only exception to this is the GAMEMAPS file, which is read when you first load 
the project.
<BR><BR>

When you insert a file into a data chunk, the project file stores the filename for 
that chunk.
The file you inserted will not appear in the data files until you compile that data 
file.
<BR><BR>

If you make changes to a file, such as BMPs and WAVs, with an external editor, you 
do not need to insert the file again.
The data chunk to filename relation is still the same.
Compiling the data file again will use the changed files for the compilation.
<BR><BR>

This will hopefully save you from having to re-insert files all the time and, in 
turn, save you some time.
