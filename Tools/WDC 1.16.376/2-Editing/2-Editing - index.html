Editing: General Guidelines
</FONT><BR>
<BR>

The GAMEMAPS file is edited directly using the map editor.
When you compile the GAMEMAPS file you save any and all changes you have made.
This file is not treated like the others because doing so would be awkward and inconvenient.

<BR><BR>
WDC compiles the other data files according to the file associations you set up.

You can create these associations using Edit->Insert file.
To remove an association and use the original data, click Edit->Use Original Data.

<BR><BR>
If you are on a data screen that has an edit screen, you can edit the associated 
file by going to Edit->Edit data.
If you try to edit a data chunk that does not have an associated file, you be asked 
for a file name to which to export the original data.
<BR>
When in an edit screen, clicking 'Cancel' will cancel any changes made during that 
session.
Clicking 'OK' will save these changes.
