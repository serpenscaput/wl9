Error Message Guide

This section is here to help you figure out what the different error messages of 
WDC mean.
<BR><BR>

<A HREF="1-Map%20Errors.html"><B>Map Errors</B></A><BR>
You receive these errors when you error check your maps.
These are just some common things that are easy to overlook when making a map.
<BR><BR>

<A HREF="2-Data%20Errors.html"><B>Data Errors</B></A><BR>
These occur when you try to open your data files or you are compiling your data files.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="3-Critical%20Errors.html"><B>Critical Errors</B></A><BR>
These are errors that should not occur.
The first thing you should do if you receive one of these errors is check for a newer 
version of WDC.
If you have the latest version, check for the entry in your Error.log file and email 
it to me so that I can try to get the issue resolved.
A description of what you were doing at the time would also be helpful.
<BR><BR>

<B><U>Unhandled Errors</U></B><BR>
These are basically the same as critical errors except that they cause WDC to crash 
and no entry is written to Error.log.
if you get one of these and you are using the latest version, it would be useful 
to write down what error message you got before clicking OK.
You could also take a screenshot and save the image as a JPG, GIF, or PNG (no BMPs 
please) and email it to me with a description of what you were trying to do when 
it crashed.
