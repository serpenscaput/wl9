This GEU module will restore the 'no clipping' mode in Wolf 3D v1.4 (both
shareware versions of v1.4). The built-in debug modes will be also be
restored if you have a version in which they are not working (shareware
versions only).

Instructions:

Run W14CLIP.EXE from the directory where your WOLF3D.EXE file exists.
This program will append the 'no clipping' code module to your WOLF3D.EXE
file. After WOLF3D.EXE has been updated, W14CLIP.EXE is no longer needed.

Please refer to the separate document file included with this archive for
details on using the 'no clipping' and/or debug modes.

 GEU
     Game Enhancement Utility
     Copyright 1993, Ralun Programming Ventures

        GEU (pronounced "goo") is written in individualized, unique versions.
     Each individual version of GEU is specifically written to enhance only
     one particular game and/or game version. There are currently 65 versions
     of GEU, each for a different game software program and/or version.

 What is "GEU" ?

        GEU is a software utility that allows you to enhance gameplay in
     over 60 popular titles of entertainment software written for IBM PC/AT
     or compatible personal computers. Each version of GEU will offer
     slightly different enhancement features dependent upon the features of
     the game it is intended to enhance.

        GEU gives control of the game variables to the game player. Game
     variables such as health, weapons, ammo, character level, play level
     and much more can be controlled by the game player with only a few
     keystrokes (each version of GEU is different, some versions will have
     less controllable variables than others). All game variables are
     controlled via memory in real time while the game is being played!
     GEU can be enabled, disabled and re-enabled at any time during play.

 Notes about this demo version of GEU

        A new demo version of GEU is released each month (since 7/93).
     The demo version is specific for one current or new game title.
     The demo version will serve as a sample of the other full versions
     of GEU available from Ralun Programming Ventures.
