<BR>

<font class="item">Base Data Folder</font>
<font class="reqd">required</font>
<BR>
This contains the data files you want to base your project on.
These data files can be of any extension (WL1, WL6, SOD, SDM, etc).
No changes will be made to these data files.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Compiled Extension</font>
<font class="reqd">required</font>
<BR>
This is the extension that will be use for your compiled data files.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Output Folder</font>
<font class="reqd">required for editing</font>
<BR>
This is where your compiled data files will be created.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Test Program</font>
<BR>
If you select your test EXE file, you will be able to test your compiled data quickly 
by going to File -> Test Project or by clicking the 'Test' button that will appear 
on your compilation status screen.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Program Parameter</font>
<BR>
This value is used as the parameter for running the test program.
If you want to test with Wolfenstein in debug mode, simply enter "-goobers" here.

<BR><BR>

<font class="item">GamePal.OBJ</font>
<BR>
This allows you to edit the GAMEPAL.OBJ file used by your source.
Simply select the file, then click the button with the opening folder to edit it.

<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Signon.OBJ</font>
<BR>
This allows you to edit the SIGNON.OBJ file used by your source.
Simply select the file, then click the button with the opening folder to edit it 
or you can click the button with the diskette to insert your own file.<BR>
NOTE: This file must be 320x200 and 256 colors.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Default Palette</font>
<BR>
This sets the palette that WDC will use when displaying graphics.
WDC automatically detects SOD and SDM files and adjusts its internal palette accordingly.

<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Map Data File</font>
<font class="reqd">required</font>
<BR>
This selects your map symbol file.
This file also contains the sound and music names.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">MAXACTORS, MAXSTATS, MAXDOORS, MAPPLANES</font>
<BR>
If you've changed these values in the code, you can change them here so the WDC's 
error reporting will be accurate.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Use Tile16s for maps, if they exist</font>
<BR>
These are only useful for the EGA games and the Wolf3D alpha, since they are the 
only games that have Tile16s and Tile16Ms.
These tiles can be used for the map screen so that the map editor looks like TED5.

<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Tile16Ms start at map code 0</font>
<BR>
This should be checked only when working with the Wolf3D alpha.
<BR><BR>

<font class="item">Base NEARTAG, Base FARTAG, Use BaseTags, Compile NEARTAG, Compile 
FARTAG, Compile RLEW Tag</font>
<BR>
These settings affect the map encryption and also need to match their values in your 
code.
If you are not familiar with these settings, please do not touch them.
If you know the base files have different tags, change the base-related tags.
If you want to compile the maps with different tags, change the compile-related tags.

WDC will take care of unchecking "Use Base Tags" when you first compile your maps.

<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
Once you have set these fields, click 'OK'.
You will then be asked for a filename for this project.
A filename is necessary because changes are made to the project file while you work.

<BR><BR>
You are now ready to begin!
