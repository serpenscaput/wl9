WolfEdit 2.1                                         (c) 1992  Bill Kirby
  
                    Wolfenstein 3-D Graphics Editor

CHANGES

This version of WolfEdit should work with all currently available versions
of Wolfenstein.

INSTALLATION

To install WolfEdit, simply unpack the zip file into the same directory
the game is installed in. 

To start the editor:

WOLFEDIT [-ey]

    -e  forces keyboard mouse emulation even if a mouse driver is
        detected

    -y  use mode Y (320x200) instead of mode X (320x240)
	mode Y gives 72Hz refresh rate, where mode X gives 60Hz


The screen is divided into several windows:

EDIT WINDOW

  This window displays the current image being edited.  Clicking the mouse 
in this window performs different functions depending on which edit tool is
selected.  The color used is dependent on which mouse button is pressed.
Each mouse button has a different color associated with it.

Currently there are only 3 edit tools:

     Pencil     : draws a single pixel

     Dropper    : "picks up" a color off the image and assigns it to
                  whichever button is pressed

     Paintbrush : fills an area


PALETTE WINDOW

  This window displays all 256 colors available to draw with.  It also
has a picture of a mouse, which displays the colors currently associated
with each button.  

NOTE!  The last color (lower right corner of the palette) is a special 
       color.  It is used to indicate "transparent", when editing object
       images.


STATUS WINDOW

  This window displays information about the image in the edit window:

    IMAGE          : image number
    TYPE           : WALL or OBJECT 
    LOCATION       : where the image is located (DISK, MEMORY, LOADING)
    MODIFIED       : whether or not the image in memory has been modified
                     since it was loaded
    IMAGE SIZE/MAX : current size of the image, and the maximum size that
                     the image can be
    IMAGES LOADED  : number of images currently in memory
    MEMORY LEFT    : amount of memory left

The image size information is only usefull for object images.  The wall
images are always 4096 bytes, and will have "4096/4096" displayed for
the size/max information.  Object images vary in size depending on how
much of the image is transparent.  The images are stored in the file in
segments of 512 bytes each, so if the original image is only 513 bytes,
there will be a 1024 byte section of the file allocated for the image.
This is why the image size can be smaller than it's maximum size.  
A modified image cannot be saved if it requires more space than the maximum
allowed for that image (the maximum size is different for each image).


SCROLL BAR 

When WolfEdit starts, it loads the first image into memory.   You can use
the scroll bar to select other images.  Clicking on the left and right
arrow buttons scrolls through the images one at a time.  You can also click 
anywhere on the bar to skip straight to a particular image.  When clicking
on the left/right arrow buttons, the right mouse button scrolls continuously,
while the left button scrolls one image, then waits for the mouse button
to be released.

If you select an image that is not currently in memory, WolfEdit will 
attempt  to load it.  If there is not enough memory available to load the 
image, WolfEdit will try to clear some memory by removing an image that 
hasn't been modified.  If all the images in memory have been modified, 
WolfEdit won't load the new image, and a message will be displayed in
the edit window to this effect.


EDIT BUTTONS

Below the edit window, there are two rows of buttons.  The top row are
for selecting the edit tool.  Initially, the "pencil" tool is selected.

The second row of buttons are for selecting various file functions:

GIF IMPORT:  (GIF with up arrow)

   Load in a portion of a GIF file into the current image.  If the GIF
   was created with the GIF EXPORT function, it will be loaded into the
   current image automatically.  If it is not a GIF that was created by 
   WolfEdit, it will be displayed on a separate screen, and you will 
   select the 64x64 section to copy into the image.   If the GIF selected 
   is larger than 320x200 or 320x240 (depending on which video mode WolfEdit 
   is running in), only the upper-left 320x200 or 320x240 portion of the 
   GIF will be displayed.

   When loading a GIF, it must be converted to use the palette that Wolf3D 
   uses.  This will cause some noticable differences in the GIF. 

   When loading a GIF into an object image (guard, table, etc), you will have 
   to paint the transparent parts yourself.  If you don't, the image will be
   to big to save.


GIF EXPORT:  (GIF with down arrow)

   Saves the current image to a GIF file.

SAVE CHANGES: (disk)

   If no images are modified, clicking on this button will have no effect.
   If the image currently displayed has not been modified, the display
   will switch to the first modified image in the list.  Then the following
   window will appear:

      Save changes:
      SAVE/SKIP/DONE

          SAVE - save the current image.  If no more are modified, control
                 returns to the editor, otherwise go to the next modified 
                 image.
          SKIP - go to the next modified image.  If there are no more
                 modified images, this has no effect.
          DONE - return to normal operation.
   

QUIT: (dos prompt)

   Exit WolfEdit.  If there are any modified images in memory, you will
   be prompted with:

      Save changes?
      YES/NO/CANCEL

          YES    - identical to clicking on the "save changes" button,
                   with the exception that after the last modified image 
                   has been saved, the program will exit.  If you click 
                   on "DONE" while there are still modified images, you 
                   will be returned to the above prompt.
          NO     - exits without saving the changed images.
          CANCEL - returns to the editor.



MOUSE EMULATION

  If you do not have a mouse, WolfEdit will turn on the keyboard mouse
emulator.  The emulator will let you use the arrow keys in place of the
mouse.  Holding down more than one arrow key, or using the HOME, PGUP,
PGDN, and END keys will move the mouse diagonally.

Also, the keys Q,A,[, and ] will function as the UP,DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT
arrow keys.

The emulator has three different button modes:

       mode    left button    right button
   ---------------------------------------
        1      Left ALT       Right ALT
        2      Left CTRL      Left ALT
        3      Right ALT      Right CTRL

WolfEdit starts in button mode 1, and can be switched to other modes
by pressing F1, F2, or F3.

If you have comments, suggestions, or find any bugs, I can be reached
via e-mail at:

If you find a GIF that WolfEdit can't load, I would appreciate it if you 
send me a copy (uuencoded), or send e-mail telling me where I can find it
via ftp.

Thanks,
Bill Kirby
