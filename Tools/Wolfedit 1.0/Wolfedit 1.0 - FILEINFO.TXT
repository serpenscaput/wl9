Various file formats:

.WAL file:

The first two bytes of this file are the width and height.  These 
values can range between 1 and 64.

The rest of the file is width*height bytes of image data, stored in 
row major order.  These bytes reference the Wolf3d palette.

PALETTE.BIN:

This file contains the palette for Wolf3d.  It contains 256 sets of
r,g,b color values.  These color values are stored as a byte each,
ranging from 0-63.

Important note: 

This file is NOT used by Wolf3d.  I created this file because I 
couldn't find the palette in any of the game files.  Changing it will 
not have any result when playing the game, but it will mess up the 
editor quite nicely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

VSWAP.WL1:

This is the graphics file for Wolf3d.  The first 6 bytes in the file
are a header.  I don't know what the header contains.  Following this, 
there are 64 pointers (long int; 4 bytes each) which point to a 4096
byte section of the file that contains image data.  This image data
is stored in column major order.

There are actually more than 64 pointers at the start of the file. 
The pointers past the 64th point to the guards and other images.  
I haven't figured out the format of these images yet.  They probably 
contain a mask as well as image data.
