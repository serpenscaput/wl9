WMAP -- v4.1
============

Here is a program to generate ALL maps for ALL episodes of 3D-Wolfenstein
(both versions 1.0 and 1.1). It uses the MAPHEAD and MAPTEMP/GAMEMAPS files
that come with the game, and produces files:

            LEVELnn.MAP  --  the ASCII map for level nn
       or
            LEVELnn.HEX  --  the HEX map for level nn

To display a description of the input syntax enter:

       WMAP /?

This version of WMAP now uses files WMAPWALL.DAT & WMAPOBJ.DAT to define the
characters to be output for each type of wall or object. These data files may
be edited to suit your own tastes, and if any wall/object code is not defined
in these files then the default character '@' is output.
