===========================

Why  SDMEDIT?

Simple, there was no editor for the Spear of Destiny demo.
Only the original editor ID used: TED5
This editor will let you edit the two levels of the demo.
You can also edit all versions of  Wolfenstein 3D.
This editor will NOT edit full versions of Spear of Destiny.
My goal: an editor supporting ALL versions, demo and full for Wolfenstein 3D & Spear 
of Destiny.
MAPEDIT7 supports all versions of Wolfenstein 3D and full versions of Spear of Destiny.


Thanks for using SDMEDIT v1.0
