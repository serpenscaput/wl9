     Tired of the same old levels? Want to see the secrets you have
been missing in some of the levels? Want to see what WOLF3D can
really do? Do you already have an editor but it will not show you all
of your objects? Want something that works with WOLF3D version 1.1?

                        Well here it is!

                          N M A P ! !

What NMAP offers:

     * Easy-to-use mouse interface

     * Area mapping

     * Customizable map tiles

     * Includes tiles for all standard objects

     * Full object viewing

     * Importing and Exporting of levels



What NMAP requires:

     * A mouse

     * VGA

     * WOLF3D Version 1.0 or 1.1


*********
* SETUP *
*********

     To configure your NMAP program, you may need to edit the
NMAP.CFG file. The NMAP.CFG file is an ASCII text file which can be
edited by any standard ASCII text editor. The first line should be a
"1" or a "0". If you have WOLF3D version 1.0 then use a "0". If you
have version 1.1, then use a "1". The second line is the filename of
the game map file. This name is usually either GAMEMAPS.WL1 (v1.1) or
MAPTEMP.WL1 (v1.0). The third line is the filename of the map header
file. This name is usually MAPHEAD.WL1 (V1.0 and V1.1). The filenames
may also include a path name.

Example:

           0                  (version 1.0 of Wolf 3D)
           MAPTEMP.WL1        (the game map file)
           MAPHEAD.WL1        (the map header file)


***********
* EDITING *
***********

     To select a wall or object, move the mouse cursor to the item
you want and press the mouse button. The name and image of the item
you selected will appear in the upper left of the screen.

     To place the wall or object, move the mouse cursor to the
location on the map where you want to put the item. Press the mouse
button and the item will appear under the mouse cursor. Holding down
the mouse button will allow you to place the same object wherever
you move the cursor on the map.

     When the mouse cursor is over the map, and nothing is being
selected, information about the wall and tile under the cursor will
appear above the map.

     To change the items in the selection menu, click on the box
labeled "Walls" to access the wall menu, the box labeled "Objs" to
select the object menu, the box labeled "up" to move up in the
current menu, or the box labeled " down" do move down in the current
menu.

***************
* DEFINITIONS *
***************

     Wolf 3D has some limitations, and to understand the limitations,
it is necessary to understand how Wolf 3D organizes its data.

WALLS:          These are the most basic element of Wolf 3D. Walls
                may be placed anywhere in any sequence. Each wall
                uses two pictures, one for the front and back and
                another for the left and right sides. Usually, these
                pictures are the same picture with different shading.

STATIC OBJECTS: These are the second most common items in Wolf 3D. A
                static object is a stationary sprite. These sprites
                are not a solid picture, and allows you to see
                through parts of them. Examples of static objects are
                Water puddles, plants, ammo, lamps, bones, food,
                treasures, and vines. There is a limit of 400 static
                objects per map.

ACTORS:         These are the animated sprites. In Wolf 3D these are
                always guards. The "dead bodies" left after shooting
                a guard are also actors. Examples of actors are: The
                guards, officers, and dogs. There is a limit of about
                150 actors.

AREAS:          Areas define how guards will respond. When you shoot
                or open a door in an area, all of the guards in that
                area will respond. The rest of the guards will
                usually be unaffected. Areas in the map are stored
                with walls. By default, NMAP filters out the areas so
                you can see the objects. Pressing the F6 key will
                reveal the areas, represented as patterns of
                different colors. Note that it is an error to use an
                area of 0 (nothing).

DOORS:          The doors in Wolf 3D are stored as walls. The area
                surrounding the doors must be set up correctly or
                erratic result may result. There are several doors,
                the first can be opened at any time. The second
                requires the yellow key (key 1) to open the door. The
                third requires the grey key (key2). Note that there
                is a limit of 64 doors per map.


****************
* EDITING KEYS *
****************

     The following keys on the keyboard may be used during editing a
map:

S - SAVE LEVEL      : Saves the current map into the game map file
Q - QUIT            : Exits NMAP. Prompts to save changes (if any)
                      first.
W - WARP TO LEVEL   : Jumps directly to a level that you specify.
+ - NEXT LEVEL      : Jumps to the next map.
- - PREVIOUS LEVEL  : Jumps to the previous map.
E - EXPORT LEVEL    : Save the current level to a .LEV file. (no
                      default extension)
I - IMPORT LEVEL    : Load a file over the current level from a .LEV
                      file.
C - CLEAR LEVEL     : Clear the current level.
F1 - WALLS          : Select the walls menu. Same as clicking on the
                      box labeled "walls"
F2 - OBJECTS        : Select the objects menu. Same as clicking on
                      the box labeled "objs".
F3 - UP             : Move menu up. Same as clicking on "up"
F4 - DOWN           : Move menu down. Same as clicking on "down"
F5 - MASK WALLS     : Display all walls as wall #1. Useful for area
                      editing and finding misplaced objects.
F6 - SHOW MAP AREAS : Displays the areas as patterns of different
                      colors.
F7 - HIDE OBJECTS   : Prevents objects from being displayed.
F8 - OBJECT PUT TYPE: Normally, objects are merged with the wall
                      placed behind it. Pressing this button toggles
                      between this mode, and directly placing the
                      object.
F10 - HELP          : Brings up a quick help screen.


*****************
* MOVING GUARDS *
*****************

     Some of the guards can be set so that they are walking around in
a level while you play. This adds some randomness to exactly where
the guards will be when you come upon them. Of course, when you get
their attention the break from any walking patterns.

     The movement of the guards is controlled by "direction
controllers". They are shown as white arrows in the object menu. These
controllers are not visible in the game, and do not count as static
objects. Examples of movement control can be found throughout the
game maps.

     If the movement controllers are incorrectly set, and the guard
breaks from the loop, the guard will keep moving until it runs into a
wall or object where it will stop.

*****************
* COMPATIBILITY *
*****************

     NMAP supports extended wall sets and guard sets. If you do not
have the extended vswap file, you should limit yourself to the known
objects and walls. Attempting to view a nonexistent object or guard
will cause the game to crash. Attempting to view a nonexistent wall
will result in junk being displayed on the walls. Extended items are
preceded with an asterisk ("*") in the menu.

     Keep in mind when exporting and importing files that not all
versions of WOLF3D have the same graphics. If you make a level that
requires extended guards, objects or walls and want to share it, make
a note to go with the file explaining that it needs the extended
graphics set.

     The NMAP.LEV file included with this program uses standard
graphics and guards. It should be possible to import it into any
version of WOLF3D.
