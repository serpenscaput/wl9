様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様

The latest revision of Wolf 3D v1.4 (Shareware Version) has the built-in
debug keys disabled. Not all copies of v1.4 have the debug keys disabled.
Use this program only if the built-in debug keys are not working on your
copy of v1.4 of the Shareware Version of Wolf 3D.

This program will restore the built-in debug keys.

Instructions:

Run W14DEBUG.EXE. This program will restore the debug mode keys to your
WOLF3D.EXE file while naming the original to WOLF3D.EX$. After WOLF3D.EXE
has been updated, W14DEBUG.EXE is no longer needed.

The debug mode is activated by starting the program with the command line
password (goobers) as follows:

wolf3d goobers

The debug mode activation key combination is:

left shift  left alt  backspace


Other text files are widely available with a complete description of all
the debug mode keys.
