Notes  : This program is used to generate ASCII maps for Wolfenstein 3D.

         This program has been tested with the shareware version of WOLF3D,
         versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.11.  It should be able to read the map
         files for all 6 episodes of Wolfenstein 3D.

         The /C, /T2, and /T3 options are intended for generating maps that
         should be helpful if you want to modify the configuration file.
         /T2 and /T3 will generate hex dumps of the maps so that you can
         see what value has been assigned to something you see on the
         screen.  The /FC option can be used to specify the name of an
         alternate configuration file.

         If you don't specify an episode and/or level number when you run
         WOLFMAP then the program will ask you for the missing information.

Required files:

   The current directory is searched for the following files:

      1) The program will first look for MAPHEAD.WL6 (which will should
         contain all 6 episodes).

         If data for only 3 episodes are found (ie. 4 to 6) in this file, then
         the program looks for MAPHEAD.WL3 as well (which should contain
         episodes 1 to 3).

      2) If MAPHEAD.WL6 was not found, it looks for MAPHEAD.WL3 which should
         contain episodes 1 to 3.

      3) If MAPHEAD.WL3 was not found, then it looks for MAPHEAD.WL1 which
         should contain episode 1 only (shareware version).

      4) When generating maps, WOLFMAP will also look for the appropriate
         MAPTEMP.WL? (WOLF3D v1.0) or GAMEMAPS.WL? (WOLF3d v1.1+) file.

      5) If you have used the /FC option, then WOLFMAP will look for the
         configuration file you have specified.

         Otherwise, it will look for the default WOLFMAP configuration file
         WOLFMAP.CFG.
