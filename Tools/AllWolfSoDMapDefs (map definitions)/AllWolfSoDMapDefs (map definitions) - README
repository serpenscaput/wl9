This is a set of definition files for the Wolfmap and WMap programs, map
editor/dump utilities for the games Wolfenstein-3D and Spear of Destiny
by id Software.

The definition files for the Wolfmap v1.6 editor have been extensively updated
from their original versions (see the Credit below) to include missing walls
and objects, correct and extend legends to comply with standard naming as
defined in the games and manuals themselves, add Spear of Destiny definitions
and improve a few color definitions.
There are a number of objects that differ between Wolf3D and SoD, in these
cases the legend for the SoD object is given after an exclamation mark (!).
These files also work with the Mapedit v4.1 and v6.0 programs (sorry, not v4.2;
and I didn't check v7.0 'cause I don't have it :)

The definition files for the WMap v4.1 dump utility are directly derived from
the Wolfmap definition files and specify plain-ASCII characters (ie. not 8-bit
PC characters) for the walls and objects, such that the resulting maps can
printed on any simple printer (eg. from Unix).
There are a number of wall definitions whose legend (which is nothing more
than a comment in these files) is given after an exclamation mark. They were
added to avoid error messages of undefined walls when dumping a few home-brew
map sets available from the Wolf3D ftp sites.

A complete set of pre-generated plain-ASCII maps for Wolf3D and SoD may be
available at the same place where you found this stuff, and is also available
from me upon request.

This zip file should contain the following files:

MAPDATA  DEF      6169 11-18-93   3:03p
OBJDATA  DEF      8868 11-18-93   3:33p
WMAPOBJ  DAT      5632 11-18-93   2:55p
WMAPWALL DAT      3590 11-18-93   2:53p
LEGEND   MAP      1455 12-03-93   2:40p
README            2943 12-06-93   5:14p
        8 file(s)      28657 bytes

This (pretty obviously :) is the README file and the LEGEND.MAP file supplies
the symbols used in the ASCII maps. MAPDATA.DEF and OBJDATA.DEF are the
Wolfmap definition files and WMAPWALL.DAT and WMAPOBJ.DAT are the related ones
for WMap. You may want to backup your original files before loading these into
your Wolfmap or WMap directory.

All files are in PC file format (ie. carriage returns/newlines).  To remove
the carriage returns such that the files can be properly viewed on a Unix
workstation, try the SunOS command dos2unix or the vi command :1,$s/\^M$//
(where ^M is ctrl-M, entered using ^V-return).

Credit: The Wolfmap (v1.6) program is by Jan Peter Dijkstra, available
	as file /wolf3d/wolfm160.arj and the WMap (v4.1) program is by
	Paul Hosken (Hosko), available as file /wolf3d/wmap41.zip, both
	at ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca .
	The map definition files were derived from an earlier set by
	Eric A. Meyer, available as file /wolf3d/wmapdefs.zip at the
	same ftp site.
