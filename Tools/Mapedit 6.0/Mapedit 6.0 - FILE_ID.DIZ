Wolfenstein 3-D Map Editor Version 6.0! This
is an update of Bill Kirby's Map editor.
This update will work on Wolf Shareware, the
3 and 6 episode versions, and SOD!  This
will also let you load & save single levels,
so you don't need to swap the entire large
file with friends.  Also supports moving of
levels inside the game!
