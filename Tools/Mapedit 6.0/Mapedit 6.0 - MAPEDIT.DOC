To use MapEdit, unpack the archive into the directory where Wolfenstein
is installed.  Type MAPEDIT to start the editor.


Key functions:

arrows - select level to view
     Q - quit (you will be prompted to save)
     C - clear level (grey brick around the outside inside filled with 
                      selected map value)
     O - toggle object display
     F - toggle floor display
     S - toggle between Statistics and Help display
     M - Memorize present map
     T - Transfer memorized map with present map
     E - Exchange memorized map with present map
     W - Write present map to a file named FLOOR.OUT
     R - Read into clipboard FLOOR.OUT
     V - Display MapEdit version number

*** NOTE:
*** If any of the commands in the Help display flash Red then there was an
*** error executing the command.  See command description below.

Map window:

Whenever the mouse is in the map window, the map and object data for the
selected square will be displayed beneath the window.  Clicking the mouse
will change either the map or object data to the currently selected item.


Legend window:

The window on the right side of the screen displays the map/object legend.
Clicking on UP/DOWN scrolls through the list.  Clicking on MAP/OBJ switches
between the map and object lists.  Clicking on an item in the list makes
it the "current" item.

After each guard, there is a 3 character description which specifies
what level the guard is, whether they are moving or stationary, and
what direction they are facing/walking.  For example, "1/S/E" means
a level 1 guard, stationary, facing east.


Memorize, Transfer and Exchange functions:

***********************************************************************
***** Note: Always make backups of your gamemap files before      *****
***** using these commands. Save your MAPHEAD.WL1 and MAPTEMP.WL1 *****
***** or MAPHEAD.WL6 and GAMEMAPS.WL6 or MAPHEAD.SOD and          *****
***** GAMEMAPS.SOD.                                               *****
***********************************************************************      
With these operations you can move maps from one floor to another.  If you
want to copy a floor, move to the floor you want to copy and press the 'M'
key.  The Memorize line in the help display will turn yellow indicating that
you have a stored floor in the clipboard.  This will now stay yellow for the
rest of the session because there will always be something stored.  You can
now Transfer (Paste) the Memorized floor wherever you want.  Move to the
floor where you want the stored floor to be and either press 'T' to Transfer
the stored floor on top of the presently displayed floor or press 'E' to
exchange the displayed floor with the Memorized floor.  The Exchange function
allows you to easily move the floors up or down a level.  If the Memorize line
in the Help display is not yellow (nothing stored) these functions won't work.
They will flash red for this case.

If you use the Transfer operation you will lose the floor that you copied the
Memorized floor on top of.  If the Statistics display is on the display will
flip to the help display during the Memorize, Transfer and Exchange operations
and then flip back to the statistics display.


Write and Read functions:

If you want to share floor maps or create floor maps with a group or if 
you have designed a favorite floor in one version of Wolfenstein and would
like to move it to a different version you can now do it with these functions.
MapEdit was designed to operate from one directory and has no directory
features nor keyboard/display functions built in.  It will take a little
extra work to implement copying and pasting from one map file to another from
within MapEdit.  To implement this feature quickly I decided to implement
the exporting and importing of maps by file.  The file is predefined as
FLOOR.OUT and you can only export/import one floor at a time.  You have to
have two directories with MapEdit and the gamemap files you want to transfer
the floors between or you must move the gamemap files in and out of the
working directory.  I know this can be a pain but this was the easiest way
without requiring major changes to the MapEdit program.  If there is a big
enough demand to implement an easier interface then I'll work on it.
To export a floor you run MapEdit on the gamemap/maphead files you want to 
export from.  You move to the floor that you want and press the 'W' key and
the displayed floor is written to 'FLOOR.OUT'.  You now quit MapEdit and copy
the FLOOR.OUT file into the directory that has the gamemap/maphead files you
want to import the floor into.  Run MapEdit and press 'R' to read into the
clipboard the file FLOOR.OUT.  Now move to the floor where you want your
imported floor and press 'T' to paste it or press 'E' to exchange it with
the displayed floor.  You copy FLOOR.OUT into the directory containing the
gamemaps you want to import the floor into or move the gamemaps into the same
directory.  An error message will be displayed if there was a problem reading
or writing the file.

A major advantage of exporting/importing by file is that you now can share
your floors with others without having to give them the whole gamemap/maphead
files.  All you have to do is give them the FLOOR.OUT file of your favorite
design and they can read it into theirs.


Clear Level:

Pressing the 'C' key will Clear the current floor placing grey brick on the
outside edge and filling the inside with the selected map value.  Before you
clear the display select the map value you want to fill with then press 'C'.
You can fill with any map value.  If the last item you selected was an Object
then if you Clear before selecting a map value the clear function will fill
using a floor value of '8C'.


MAPDATA.DEF and OBJDATA.DEF:

If you figure out a new object, you can add it's description to the
object/map list by editing the MAPDATA.DEF or OBJDATA.DEF file.
Each line in the file contains 3 items:

0000 0000 Objectname

The first four digits are HEX for the object number.  Right now, even
though their are 4 digits, you can only put objects from 0000-00ff in.

** Note version 4.1a allows up to 0116.

The second four digits define how the object will look in the map.
The first two digits are the primary/secondary colors.  The third
digit is the graphic type, and the fourth digit is the character
string to use if the graphic type is "text".

Colors:
   0 - black
   1 - blue
   2 - green
   3 - cyan
   4 - red
   5 - magenta
   6 - brown
   7 - light grey
   8 - dark grey
   9 - light blue
   a - light green
   b - light cyan
   c - light red
   d - light magenta
   e - yellow
   f - white

Graphic types:

   0 - text (uses fourth character of graphic definition)
   1 - solid box
   2 - checkered
   3 - solid box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   4 - checkered box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   5 - large filled circle (primary) with smaller circle (secondary)
   6 - horizontal bar
   7 - vertical bar
   8 - two color box (used for landscape view)
   9 - single pixel centered
   a - 3x3 pixel block
   b - 3x5 pixel block
   c -
   d - X (primary)
   e - rectangle
   f - arrow  (secondary color indicates direction: 0=n,1=ne,2=e,3=se,
                                                    4=s,5=sw,6=w,7=nw)


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

   This program would not have been possible without Paul (Hosko) Hosken,
author of WMAP, who figured out the original map file formats.

Thanks Hosko!
