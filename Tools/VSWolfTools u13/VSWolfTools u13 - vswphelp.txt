For viewing, extracting and replacing wall pictures, sprites and sounds in
  any Wolfenstein3D/spear related VSWAP/GFXTILES file. For v1.0 to v1.4.

                          -Using the program-
*Select an item in the list to view/hear or replace.
*Animate any set of selected walls or sprites.
*For walls and sprites, click the picture and see the figure against a
   background with floor and 'normal' ceiling colors for that level.
*The current picture/sound is stored in the program directory as
   wp.bmp/wp.wav from where it can be opened in an editor, such as Floedit,
   or another open VSWAPED program.
*VSWAPED has all the features of the former Wolfenpack 3.8, plus:
   Supports big graphics (128x128 pixels), edits data, adds items.

                              -Controls -
*Open a vswap file with 64x64 or 128x128 pixels graphics. 
               The latest used file is loaded by default.
               Big files take some time to load. Click the 'STOP' text
               to stop the process if you don't want this particular file.

*Palette tool :The 'Palette tool' enables you to extract the color palette
               of a game in a few minutes. See the palette tool's help file.

*LOG          :A cumulative logfile with the changes you have made. It can
               be marked, copied and deleted like any other text.

<my portrait> :View this helpfile.

                            ---on opening---

 To the right is a colored column that shows the occupied pointers, and the
    current item's place here. Further right a list of all elements + pictures.
    To the left is a big picture of the selected item.

----------------------------further controls-----------------------------------

*Descriptions: Opens a descriptions file. You must open one the first time
   you run the program. If you CANCEL opening, only item numbers will be shown.

*The multicolor button opens a new palette file (*.pal or *.act), else the
   program decides what palette will be used for images (wolfenstein or spear).

*Set the level number to see the 'normal' ceiling colors in the picture.

*Save Selected: Select any set of items and save them all. If the filename
   is 'default', the items will be saved as 'wallxxxx.bmp' / spritexxxx.bmp /
   soundxxxx.wav' where xxxx is its number.
   If 'default' is replaced with a name, fex 'pq', the items will be saved as
   'pqwallxxxx.bmp' / 'pqspritexxxx.bmp' / pqsoundxxxx.wav'.
   Pictures will be saved with the palette in use.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Details show the number of possible wall, sprite and sound pointers
   and how many of them are used in this vswap file.
   Item details can be shown in decimal or hex. The true data size is shown,
   not the allocated space. For sounds, the duration in seconds is shown,
   for sprites the packing of its data ('light' or 'tight') is shown.

*You can disable/enable seeing images in the list.

*3 Boxes show picture coordinates, palette index and the color itself.

*EDIT: Opens or closes the EDIT panel.

---------------------------------about EDIT------------------------------------

                    -Replacing walls, sprites or sounds-

 ^ *Select the item to be replaced.
 | *from file : Import the item from a file (*.bmp or *.wav). 
 | *from app  : Import from this program OR: start a new VSWAPED program,
 |          select an item in the new VSWAP file, click the APP button
 |          in the old program, then the item is copied to the old.
 |          When finished, close the new VSWAPED program.
 | *For sprites, you may check 'Tight' and save some space, allowing for more
 |          complicated sprites (more stuff put into 4096 bytes).
 |          My 'tight' packing is quite good, but probably not the best.
 |_*Click *USE to incorporate the new item into the vswap file.
   *Repeat the steps above as many times as you need.
   *You can *UNDO all replacements made since you started the program.
   *When finished, click *SAVE TO GAME and save the modified file.
            Option: Make a backup copy (name+'bk') of the original file.

*RESTORE GAME: Restore the game's vswap file from the backup copy.

                    ---controls below the big picture---

                For walls and sprites:
*<number>      :Set animation frame speed in ms for walls and sprites.
*Animate       :Start or stop animation.
*(<)and(>)     :Step through the animated frames.
*<radio btns>  :Choose frame system used (pacmen/superguards/guards)
                OR SELECT any number of items. The animation goes
                through the selected items in table order, repeating.

*<sqare,arrow>: For sounds: Stop or start playing.

***********Advanced: Adding items to the mod, Editing descriptions*************

*Click <the Professor>. Then you can add items to the VSWAP file and edit
   descriptions.
   In fact you can add anything, and the mod still works, but          Beware!
   You can add walls, but nothing else useful unless you recompile the engine!
   In a shareware mod: if you also fill in vacant pointers, you can get a
   total of 64 wall pairs!, the normal maximum for useful walls in a mod.
  *click in the list to select category (walls,sprites,sounds).
   For walls you must SELECT the FIRST door image.
  *Adjust the number of items you want to add.
  *Click ADD. For walls in a shareware mod you can fill in vacant pointers
   OR add the selected number.
  *If you regret, click UNDO.
  *When finished, click EDIT and SAVE the vswap file. Maybe make a backup.
   ADDing items will update the list and the logfile.

 Descriptions are not essential for using the program, but if you are
   interested, click on the professor and 'Descriptions' and edit the file.
!! ALTERING THE DESCRIPTIONS FILE WILL NOT AFFECT THE VSWAP FILE IN ANY WAY !!
!! The list to the right shows only names for USED pointers                 !!
  *Now new controls appear. You can change, add or delete a line in the file.
   You must *USE changes to keep them and save them later.
   You can  *UNDO changes made since the latest save. 
   To add an item, select an item image and click 'New line' (over) or
  'New next line' (under the selected line), and add a comment of any length.
   For doors you should select the first door line and click 'new next line'.
   Do this as many times as needed. Now edit the names of the new lines.
   NB: Door images are almost always the last of the wall images. There is
   nothing in the VSWAP file to tell where doors start, so the first door line
   is marked 'Doors'. Walls and doors have 2 images each, sprites normally one,
   but for actor sprites you must set the number of common images, fex.
   51 mutants. If you want to make a new file, it is best to modify an existing
   one, fex. wolfenstein.txt or spear.txt, and save the result under another
   name. R O M.txt explains how the file is made up.
   If there is only 1 image to each wall you can tell the program by putting
   'single' in the comment in the first line, for C7 and OCB.

                                 ---NOTES---

     -Pictures must be in bmp format, but can be of any size. If needed,
      the colors will be resampled to the nearest colors in the game palette,
      and the picture will be resized to 64x64 or 128x128 pixels. The
      aspect ratio is NOT preserved. Use an image editor if you need more.

     -the compressed size of a 64x64 pixel sprite must not exceed 4096 bytes!

     -Sounds must be 8-bit mono in RIFF wav format and less than 65536 bytes
      (duration 9.5 sec). If wanted they are resampled to the standard 6896 Hz
      of the game (using linear interpolation).

      This program runs on 64-bit machines and in some respects it works
      better than Floedit II, such as in handling sprites and big graphics.
