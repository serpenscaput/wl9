STORY:
===========================================================================

1941: World War II rages across Europe, America has just entered the war..

You are 1st Lieutenant William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the allies bad boy of espionage. 
Just a few weeks ago, you were on a reconnaissance mission of extreme importance. 
You have been captured and brought to Castle Fefehlbuchstabiersburg for interrogation 
by the dreaded SS. All you know about this castle is that it is owned by Heinrich 
Himmler, the leader of the SS. Your new mission: ESCAPE, and KILL Himmler if you 
get the chance.

As a guard enters your cell to escort you to the interrogation chamber, you draw 
out your knife that was never recovered when you were scuffed, and silently end his 
life. Now you've got a gun and eight floors of hell to get through, good luck!

(FAQ)

You may be wondering why would a 10 level addon have a FAQ? Well, in this case, 

I was asked this question many times:
===========================================================================


Q) What took you so long to finish this?

A) This project was started around 2010, it is now 2012. In 2010 it was real close 
to being finished but then my computer crashed and it was lost. In 2011, I went up 
and down, working on other things, and at one point giving up, then trying again, 
then taking a 2 month break. Not much progress was done. In 2012 things worked out 
much better, and in about 6 months it was completed. My next project will not take 
as long I hope.
