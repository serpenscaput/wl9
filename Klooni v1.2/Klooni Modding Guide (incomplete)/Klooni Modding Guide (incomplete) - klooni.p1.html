<b>Klooni modding standard</b>
<p>Klooni was build for modding and our intention from day one was
to run mods without overwriting any gamedata so you can play any mods and the main
game without any of them interfering with each other. And for that reason I created
Klooni modding standard.</p>

<p>The only purpose is to make sure we have error-free mods and also
running mods wouldn't require user to do anything except run the mod
from the batch file.</p>

<b>Mapping limitations</b>
<p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td>Monsters:&nbsp;</td><td>150</td></tr>
<tr><td>Static objects:&nbsp;</td><td>190</td>
<tr><td>Doors:&nbsp;</td><td>32</td>
<tr><td>Trigger tiles:&nbsp;</td><td>80</td>
<tr><td>Actor triggers:&nbsp;</td><td>80</td>
</table></p>
<b>Engine limitations</b>
<ul>
<li>Wall patches can’t be in the door-rail tiles.
<li>Door rails must not be in tiles with value over 63.
<li>There may not be more than 60 visible objects/monsters.
<li>Player can't see more than 10 visible opening doors.
<li>6 episodes, with 60 maps each maximum.
</ul>


<b>Requirements</b>
<ul>
<li>Mod name must be unique, no two mods may share a name.
<li>Mod is packaged in a standard way to either .rar or .zip format.
<li>Mod has a properly named startup batch file.
<li>All maps have to have an accessible exit.
<li>Mapping or engine limitations are not exceeded.
<li>All additional files go inside the mod directory.
</ul>

<b>Packing your mod for release</b>
<p>&lt;modname&gt; = The name you used for the directory that contains your maps.
<p><b>Step 1:</b><br>Create a rar or zip archive and name it "&lt;modname&gt;.rar" or "&lt;modname&gt;.zip"</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b><br>Add the launch file "&lt;modname&gt;.bat" to the archive.</b></p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b><br>Add directory &lt;modname&gt; to the archive, it should contain your episodes and any other extra files.</p>

<b>Uploading mods</b>
<p>If you want your mod uploaded to KFH Games website,
make sure your mod meets the requirements of Klooni modding
standard, and send it to us for verification.</p><br>

Happy modding!<br>
