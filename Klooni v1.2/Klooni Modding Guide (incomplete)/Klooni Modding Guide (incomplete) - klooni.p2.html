<h2>Chapter 1: The basics</h2>

<b>Creating a directory</b>
<p>Klooni uses command line to execute custom mods. So to create a
mod you do not have to and you should not overwrite any gamedata.</p>

<p>So first off, pick a directory name for your mod. Since DOS recognizes
only 8 characters, the directory name must not exceed that limit.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we create a directory called <b>“tutorial”</b> to the game
directory. As you can see it’s exactly 8 characters long, so it’s ok.</p>

<b>Episode structure</b>
<p>Each episode will be a sub-directory in <b>“tutorial”</b> directory. To
create our first episode we create a directory <b>“Ep1”</b> inside the
tutorial directory.</p>

<p>This will be the place for all the files for the episode number one.
You can create up to 6 episode directories. <b>“Ep2, Ep3, …”</b>.</p>

<p>Each episode directory will contain the following required files
in order to be recognized.</p>

<b>Required files</b>
<p>Now that we have created a directory for the mod, copy empty <b>“gamemaps.wad“</b>
and <b>“maphead.wad”</b> which can be found in the same archive you
copied this document from.</p>

<p>We will not open Chaos-Edit just yet. First we will define a name for our
episode and the three maps. To do that we will create a file called
<b>“episode.ini”</b>. Make sure the episode.ini is an ASCII file.</p>

<p><b>Contents of episode.ini:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('episodeini')"><span id="episodeini_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="episodeini">Tutorial episode
{
First map;
Triggers;
Ooh, a secret;
}
</div></pre>

<p>Do not deviate from this syntax. Do not add tabs or any other spaces than
those that you use to separate words. Don’t forget <b>“;”</b>.</p>

<p>The first line contains the episode name in this case it’s called <b>“Tutorial
episode”</b>. The episode name length is limited to 26 characters, that is
because the episode title must be copied to the menu and menu does not allow
strings longer than 26.</p>

<p>Map names will be defined inside the brackets, separated with a <b>“;”</b>
and <b>a line break (enter)</b>. In this example I define three maps, one of which will later become a
secret level. Map name is limited to 32 characters.</p>

<p>
<b>Map 1:</b> First map<br>
<b>Map 2:</b> Triggers<br>
<b>Map 3:</b> Ooh, a secret<br>
</p>

<b>Music</b>
<p>Having music in the maps is not a requirement, but if you do not define
any songs the music will not play. If you define only one song, that one
song will play in all the maps.</p>

<p>To have music in your levels, we’ll create a standard ASCII file,
just like in the previous step, and name it <b>“songs.ini”</b>.</p>

<p><b>Contents of songs.ini:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('songsini')"><span id="songsini_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="songsini">261,
277,
302,
</div></pre>

<p>Notice how I add a <b>“,”</b> after each entry. The comma is used to tell
the parser that this is the end of the number. It is required even for the
last number in the list.</p>

<p>The first number is the music for the first map, the second number is
the music for the second map, and so on.</p>

<p>The song number must be in the range of 261-302. To know what song is which
number. You have to get a version of Chaos-Edit that supports music chunks
that are bigger than 64k.</p>

<b>Previewing songs in Chaos-Edit</b>
<p>Requires Chaos-Edit preRelease v1.26 or above. First load the music by clicking on the <img src="img/loadmus.gif">
-icon on the toolbar to the left. Select file named <b>“Audiot.wad”</b> it should be in the game’s root directory.</p>

<p>Switch to the music tab by first selecting the <b>“Audio” tab</b> from
the top and then choose <b>“Music” tab</b>.</p>
<p><img class="imgb" src="img/mustab.gif"></p>

<p>The number we use to define the song is the chunk number that can be seen on the bottom right of the Chaos-Edit window.
You can see that the first map is using the first available song <b>261</b>, <b>“At Doom’s Gate”</b>.</p>
<p><img class="imgb" src="img/muschunk.gif"></p>

<b>Par times</b>
<p>Par times are displayed on the bottom of the Intermission screen.</p>
<p><img class="imgb" src="img/partime.gif"><br>
<font size="2">In this map the par time is 65 seconds, which makes it 1 minute and 5 seconds.</font></p>

<p>So to create par times for our maps we define the time in seconds.
Just remember the maximum time is <b>90 minutes (90 x 60 = 5400 seconds)</b>.</p>

<p>As a general rule, par time is the least amount of time you have to spend on
the map. To beat the time you must run through the map as fast as you can,
killing only the enemies that get in your way.</p>

<p>To set par times we’ll create a file called <b>“partimes.ini”</b>, the file
format is the same as in <b>“songs.ini”</b>, except this time the number that
we use is the par time in seconds. If you look at the above example the par
time is set to 65 seconds, but at the intermission the game will convert
it to minutes and seconds.</p>

<p><b>Contents of partimes.ini:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('partimesini')"><span id="partimesini_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="partimesini">65,
85,
95,
</div></pre>

<p><b>65 = 1:05 (60s + 5s)<br>
85 = 1:25 (60s + 20s + 5s)<br>
95 = 1:35 (60s + 30s + 5s)</b></p>

<b>Intermission text</b>
<p><img class="imgb" src="img/intermission.gif"><br>
<font size="2">Intermission text from E1M9.</font></p>

<p>The intermission text is a piece of text that can be displayed
before or after any given map. The background can be any texture
in the game.</p>

<p>In this example we create one of these text files. It will
be displayed after the intermission of the second level.</p>

<p>The filename syntax is <b>“text*.ini”</b> where <b>“*“</b>
is the map after which the text is displayed. If you create
<b>“text0.ini”</b> the text will be displayed before entering
the first map of the episode, whereas <b>“text1.ini”</b> will
be shown after the first map’s intermission screen and so on.</p>

<p>Create a new ASCII file, named <b>“text2.ini”</b> for this example.</p>

<p>First we should load the textures in Chaos-Edit. Click on the <img src="img/loadtex.gif">
-icon on the toolbar to the left. Select a file named <b>“Vswap.wad”</b> from
the game’s root directory.</p>

<p>Select the <b>"Textures"</b> tab.</p>
<p><img class="imgb" src="img/textab.gif"></p>

<p>The value we use for the background texture is the <b>“Wallnum”</b>
that can be seen on the bottom right of the Chaos-Edit window. You can
browse the textures using the scrollbar.</b>

<p><img class="imgb" src="img/wallnum.gif"></p>

<p>Now edit the <b>"text2.ini"</b> that we previously created.</p>

<p><b>Contents of text2.ini:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('text2ini')"><span id="text2ini_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="text2ini">88,<br>
Congratulations!\p <br>
You have completed the tutorial episode.
</div></pre>

<p><b>Formatting intermission text:</b></p>

<p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>”88,”</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" height="35">
The texture number that we chose for the background. Note the “,”.</td>
</tr>
<td valign="top"><b>”\p ”</b></td><td>
This will change the paragraph. It will create one empty line
and moves the cursor to the beginning of the new line, enter will not
change the line and will not be treated as a space. Note there’s a space
included in the <b>“\p ”</b> command so it’s treated as a word.</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>Other than that, there’s no special syntax.</p>

<p><img class="imgb" src="img/text2.gif"><br>
<font size="2">The result looks like this.</font></p>

<b>Secret maps</b>
<p>It is not necessary to have secret maps in your episode, but it is a nice
addition. Since Klooni 1.2, you need a new file called <b>"secrets.ini"</b>
in the episode directory.</p>

<p>For the tutorial episode we will set E1M2 as the source map and E1M3 as the
destination map. Each pair of numbers are separated by a <b>","</b> and <b>a line
break (enter)</b>.</p>

<p>First number in the pair is the source map and the second number is the
destination level. Remember that level numbers start from 0 not 1. Secret maps
must be the last maps in the episode, because the level prior to last secret level
is considered to be the final map of the episode. <i>Don't forget to put the
secret exits in the right maps!</i></p>

<p><b>Contents of secrets.ini:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('secretsini')"><span id="secretsini_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="secretsini">1,2,</div></pre>

<p>That was for our tutorial mod, but I'll give an example for a ten level mod
with two secret levels.

<p><b>secrets.ini example:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('secretsiniex')"><span id="secretsiniex_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="secretsiniex">3,8,<br>5,9,</div></pre>

<p>In this example level 9 is accessed from level 3 and level 10 from level 5.
Notice that the numbers in the ini are the actual level numbers minus one.</p>

<b>Running your mod</b>
<p>So you can later test your mod, we will also create a batch file
that will launch it. It is also a requirement of Klooni modding standard.</p>

<p>Mods are run from command line like this: <b>"klooni.exe /&lt;modname&gt;"</b></p>

<p>Create a file called <b>"tutorial.bat"</b>, or "<b>&lt;modname&gt;.bat"</b> if you
have a custom mod, where "<b>&lt;modname&gt;"</b> is the directory name of your mod.</p>

<p><b>Contents of tutorial.bat:</b>&nbsp;(<a href="javascript:toggle('tutorialbat')"><span id="tutorialbat_lnk">hide</span></a>)</p>
<pre><div id="tutorialbat">klooni.exe /tutorial</div></pre>
