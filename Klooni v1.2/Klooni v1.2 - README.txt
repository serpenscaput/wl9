About Klooni:

Why make another Doom-to-Wolf conversion?

The answer is simple, we could not use those fancy Doom editors and
so we decided to bring as much of Doom gameplay to Wolfenstein-3D,
a game we are very familiar with.

Since the reason we started with Klooni was modding, we decided to
make the engine support modding from ground-up so as little as
possible is hard-coded to the game exe.

Klooni is currently the most advanced engine available. It features
vertically opening doors , variable player eye-level, trigger system,
etc...

Klooni contains all the enemies from DoomII except Spider Mastermind,
enemies act and think like their Doom counterparts.

Klooni also features all Doom II weapons, including the devastating
BFG9000, behavior of each weapon has been modeled as closely as
possible.

Since Klooni is based on Doom graphics, it is required to own a
copy of Doom II or Final Doom to play the game, fortunately still
available at a reasonable price.
