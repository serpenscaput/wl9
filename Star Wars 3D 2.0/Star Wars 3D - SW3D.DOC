    `--------------------[ Version 2.0 4-12-94 ]---------------------'


Star Wars 3D is simply an add-on for Apogee's and IDGames's Wolfenstein 3D
Shareware version 1.4.  It will only work with 1.4, so don't try it with
v1.0 or anything else.

--INSTALLATION------------------------------------------------------------
Installation is simple.  Create a new directory on you Hard Drive and
install a fresh copy of Wolfenstein 3D v1.4 into it.  (the file
#1WOLF14.ZIP) Then unzip this file into that directory, answering yes when
it askes you to overwrite any files.

--RUNNING THE GAME--------------------------------------------------------
The first time, type SW3D or WOLF3D and choose the proper options (sound,
window size, controls).  From now on you can type WOLF3D to get into the
game, SW3D to quickly get into the game, or type SW for the quickest way,
but you go right to level 1, without the chance to load any save games
or change the difficulty level (it starts on difficulty level 3).

--THE CHEAT CODES---------------------------------------------------------
The cheat codes only work if you type SW or SW3D, not if you type WOLF3D.
To enter the cheat codes, you must be in the game, not on any menu screens.
Hold down LEFTSHIFT-ALT-BACKSPCACE to enter cheat mode.  Then you hold town 
TAB and press the folowing keys for diferent cheat:

G - GOD MODE (nothing hurts you)
I - FREE ITEMS (once for gun #3, again for gun #4)
W - WARP TO ANY LEVEL (type in the level number when it asks you to)
Q - QUIT (quits quickly, rather then pressing ESC then ESC-Y)
S - SLOW MOTION (and slow is an understatement)
E or Q - BEAT CURRENT LEVEL

There are others, but these are the most helpfull ones. Try not to cheat 
unless you're stuck, otherwise it takes out all the fun!


--THE SW 3D GRAPHICS------------------------------------------------------
All SW-3D is, really, is an edited graphic file.  I think it's great and
really fun to play.  2 graphics (originally steel plating, and purple
wall [with various decorations]) only appear in 1 level each. They are
some of the best graphics in the game, so if you find 'em then have fun.
The guards have been changed from Nazi's to various TIE's.

BROWN GUARD: TIE INTERCEPTOR
BLUE GUARD: TIE BOMBER
DOGS: TIE FIGHTER
FINAL BOSS: ??

NOTE:  If I had a WOLF3D shareware version sound editor, there would be TIE
sounds in this file, but I don't so you still hear dogs barking, etc. as your
gunning down TIE's!

With version 1.2, the knife has been changed to a lightsaber, the ammo
has been changed to a thermal detonator, the 1UP has been changed to 
Luke's face (instead of B.J. Blackowticz or however you spell it).  
There's a few other changes, too.

With v2.0, since I upgraded to v1.4 of Wolfenstein, I have 2 more walls to 
fill.  Grey w/ Slime and Grey w. Less Slime.  So I changed those, check em 
out.  I also decided to change Red Brick w/ Wreath.  It was the same as the
other 2, but now its some stuff imported from XWing.

--THE SW3D LEVELS---------------------------------------------------------
The levels that come with SW3D are really the same as the originals, but
they are slightly modified so you can see more graphics.  6 graphics
(originally grey stone 3, grey stone w/ signs,  grey w/ slime, grey w/ less
slime, steel plating w/ signs, and red w/ eagle) were in the graphics file, 
but were never put into the game.  In my levels, they are.  What this means, 
is you won't see the 3rd section of the 3 panel Star Destroyer wall, or the 
new graphic for the Steel w/signs, grey w/ signs and grey with slime if you 
play these graphics with the original levels.

--MAPDATA.DEF & OBJDATA.DEF-----------------------------------------------
For those of you who have MAPEDIT or a similar program, you will know what
these files are.  The names off the walls and some of the objects have
been changed in these file so if you wanna edit maps with SW3D graphics,
it's easier.  Do not use these files with the registered version, or SOD,
because I took out all of the graphics from those versions.  Also, do
not put down any "unknowns" when editing, it could freeze up your
computer when you try to play a level with it in it.

--WOLF3D.EXE--------------------------------------------------------------
The reason I included this was because without it, the cheat codes would
not work.  Apogee took them out of v1.4.  So I got this file that put them 
back in, and this is it.

--THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE GAME--------------------------------------

--THANKS------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for Bill Kirby for creating WOLFEDIT, and MAPEDIT, without wich none
of this would have been created.  Thanks to Bryan Baker and Dave Huntoon
for updating it, and making it easy to convert my v1.0 maps to v1.4 maps.  
Thanks to Alchemy Mindworks, Inc. for making Graphip Workshop, without wich 
almost all of the walls couldn't have been made, and none of the PCX's I
captured from XWing would have been converted to .Gif's to put in WOLFEDIT.
And thanks to each and every user of the FIDONET STAR WARS CONF, without 
their encouragement and GIF sending I would have never have even made this.  
I probably wouldn't be a huge SW fan, either.  

A VERY SPECIAL THANX to Matt Hummon.  He let me use his XWing when I 
didn't have enough room on my hard drive, he drew all the lightsaber 
frames, he drew the Luke 1-UP and the thermal detonator (well, he copied 
them from the Super Empire Strikes Back manual, but still, I couldn't 
do that).  Thanx again!  Thanx also to everyone else I forgot.

--FINAL WORDS-------------------------------------------------------------
If you know who I am, do not send me any money.  Send it to Apogee.
Register WOLF, register Blake Stone, go out and buy Spear of Destiny, I
don't care.  Or send it to ID and register DOOM, just as long as I
don't get any money.  I apologize if I offended anyone at Apogee or ID
for creating this, but I'm obviously not the first to do it, so you're
probably used to it by now.  I'm also sorry if I offended anyone at
LUCASARTS, but I *really* hope that Lucasarts will instead like the idea
and make a SW3D of their own.  Call it Star Wars 3D if you want, I dont 
care, just make it!  The level in Rebel Assualt was great, but we want 
more STAR WARS!
