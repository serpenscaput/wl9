Arielus's Xmas Wolfenstein 3-D
==============================

README.TXT


Hello there. I'm Norberto Ariel Castañares, and I'm writing this little text in my 
house, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The file you're reading, along with two other 
files, form what I've come to call 'Arielus's Xmas Wolfenstein 3-D', an 'Xmas Wolfenstein 
3-D' modification. This same title was first uploaded to the Internet during the 
early months of 2002, but in different conditions. At that time, a file named 'arielusxm.zip' 
was made available for download, containing exactly these files:

Name                     Size       Date
Audiohed.WL1             2 KB       January 1st, 1993
Audiot.WL1               130 KB     January 1st, 1993
Config.WL1               1 KB       March 16th, 2002
Gamemaps.WL1             62 KB      July 9th, 1998
Maphead.WL1              1 KB       July 9th, 1998
Please, Read Me!.TXT     1 KB       March 16th, 2002
Vgadict.WL1              1 KB       January 1st, 1993
Vgagraph.WL1             319 KB     January 1st, 1993
Vgahead.WL1              1 KB       January 1st, 1993
Vswap.WL1                726 KB     January 9th, 1990
Wolf3D.EXE               108 KB     January 1st, 1993

At the moment of this writing, I do not know whether 'Arielus's Xmas Wolfenstein 
3-D' was uploaded in a different way at that time, and I do not know whether it can 
now be found in a different way either. I do not even know whether the same 'arielusxm.zip' 
I've described above can still be downloaded nowadays. Fact is, I did not include 
everything I should have in 'Please, Read Me!.TXT' at that time, and so I've decided 
to release a definite version of this 'Xmas Wolfenstein 3-D' mod; one with a proper 
text file. I believe this is the way I should have done things in the first place.


After I've finished writing this, 'Arielus's Xmas Wolfenstein 3-D' will start being 
available for download inside a file called 'NACXMW3D.ZIP', which will contain exactly 
these files:

Name             Size      Date
AUDIOHED.WL1     2 KB      January 1st, 1993
AUDIOT.WL1       130 KB    January 1st, 1993
GAMEMAPS.WL1     62 KB     July 9th, 1998
MAPHEAD.WL1      1 KB      July 9th, 1998
README.TXT       6 KB      July 5th, 2004
VGADICT.WL1      1 KB      January 1st, 1993
VGAGRAPH.WL1     319 KB    January 1st, 1993
VGAHEAD.WL1      1 KB      January 1st, 1993
VSWAP.WL1        726 KB    January 9th, 1990
WOLF3D.EXE       108 KB    January 1st, 1993

Just like 'arielusxm.zip', 'NACXMW3D.ZIP' will contain all the files needed to play 
the mod.

Alright, what can I say about the mod itself? Let's see... I started it in July of 
1997, and finished it off in July of 1998, exactly on Argentina's Independence Day. 
I was 16 years old back then. I do not remember exactly what version of 'Xmas Wolfenstein 
3-D' I used as a base; I do not remember which files that version had. Everything 
I kept from this mod after finishing it in 1998 was a group of only three files, 
which are among the ones showed immediately above. These files were 'Gamemaps.WL1', 
'Maphead.WL1' and 'Vswap.WL1'. Right before releasing this mod in 2002, I added 'Audiohed.WL1', 
'Audiot.WL1', 'Vgadict.WL1', 'Vgagraph.WL1', 'Vgahead.WL1' and 'Wolf3D.EXE', which 
I had taken from an Apogee's shareware 1.4 version of 'Wolfenstein 3-D' I had, and 
then wrote and included 'Please, Read Me!.TXT', too. 'Config.WL1' ended up included 
in 'arielusxm.zip', too. This definite release will contain almost the same files. 
Every file's name will now contain only capital letters, 'Please, Read Me!' and 'Config.WL1' 
will not be included, and 'README.TXT' will.

'Arielus's Xmas Wolfenstein 3-D' features 10 maps that I made entirely from scratch. 
This is what this mod offers. Nowadays, more than six years after its completion, 
I'm still able to get a lot of fun with it. 'NACXMW3D.ZIP' hasn't been released at 
the moment of this writing, but it surely has at the moment you're reading this. 
I really hope you, wherever you are and whenever you're reading this, can have some 
fun with 'Arielus's Xmas Wolfenstein 3-D' too.

Should you be interested, these are other mods I've released so far:

'Arielus's Spear of Destiny'
'Arielus's Wolfenstein 3-D'
'The Golden Episodes'

Also, these are the ones in which I've taken part so far:

'Alliance of Powers'
'Beyond Mutantstein Special Edition'
'Map Making Mania Melée'

Since I don't know exactly where and in which conditions the mentioned titles will 
be at the moment you read this, it will be up to you to find them if you're interested 
in doing so. If that's the case, I wish you the best of lucks. I trust you won't 
have any major difficulties. There are some other titles for which I've done beta 
testing tasks, but I don't think that's enough merit to name them here.

So well, I think that's it. If you feel like sending me an e-mail, please hesitate 
not and do so. I will be glad to read whatever you have to say. These are the accounts 
I currently have:

arielus1982( (at) )argentina.com
arielus1982( (at) )hotmail.com
arielus1982( (at) )yahoo.com.ar

Note the brackets surrounding the ' (at) ' symbols. I stated my accounts the way I did 
as a way of protecting them against those programs designed to search for e-mail 
addresses to be sent spam to. Make sure you don't include any bracket if you write 
to me, otherwise I won't receive any message. And, if you include no bracket and 
all the same I don't get any message, then it's because I no longer use the account 
you sent the message to. If that's the case, it will be up to you to find a way to 
contact me if you're still interested in doing so. Again, I wish you the best of 
lucks.

Gotta go now. I've run out of words, and of peppermint liqueur...
