To access the debug keys in Wolf3D:

Run Wolf 3D V1.0 with NEXT as a command line parameter

C>WOLF3D NEXT

Then when in the game in V1.0 press TAB-CTRL-ENTER.


OR IN V1.1:
Run Wolf 3D V1.1 with GOOBERS as a command line parameter.

C>WOLF3D GOOBERS

Then when in the game in V1.1 press LEFTSHIFT-ALT-BACKSPACE

(Notice that you must use the left shift key and not the right shift
key. Also notice that you use backspace (above the enter key), and
not the back arrow (numeric keypad/arrow group))

     A message will appear saying "Debugging keys are now available!"
Now you may access to the debugging features, by pressing a the keys
as listed below.

    DEBUG KEYS:

     TAB-B   Border color
     TAB-C   Lists the use of static characters
     TAB-E   takes you up 2 levels
     TAB-F   shows your location
     TAB-G   god mode (you can't be hurt)
     TAB-H   hurts you (lowers your health)
     TAB-I   free items (extra ammo, points, and gun)
     TAB-M   shows memory usage
     TAB-N   allows you to walk through walls
     TAB-O   shows overhead map
     TAB-P   unknown, pauses and sometimes crashes the game.
     TAB-Q   locks up computer/resets game
     TAB-S   slow motion
     TAB-T   shows tiles/sprites/sound currently in memory
     TAB-V   adjusts the amount of space moved when movement controls
             are used.
     TAB-W   warp to any level (1-10)
     TAB-X   extra stuff (I can't figure out what this does)

     Since these are not documented keys, they may be different in
other versions.

    At any time pressing M-L-I (keys M, L, and I at the same time)
will give you both keys, 100% health, and more ammo, but it will (or
is supposed to) set your score to zero to eliminate any chance of
getting a high score.

             nn is a number (usually 0-9)
             This immediately starts a game with the requested level.

             your file/program manager.
NOWAIT     - Bypasses the PC-13 and main title screen. With this, the
             initilization screen will not require a key to be
             pressed. Once the initilization is done, the program
             will IMMEDIATELY go to the main menu. Note that the
             demos can not be accessed when this parameter is
             specified.

NOCOMP     - Disables the compensation for not-so-compatible VGA
             cards.
HIDDENCARD - Forces VGA if the video auto detection fails.


The version number of Wolf3D can be found on the startup screen in
the lower right-hand corner. If you still do not know which version
of Wolf3D you have, you can use both the GOOBERS and NEXT parameters
on the command line. Wolf3D ignores any unrecognized parameters.

    A standard command-line may look something like this:

     C:>WOLF3D NOWAIT GOOBERS

    A TEDlevel line may look something like this:

     C:>WOLF3D NOWAIT GOOBERS TEDLEVEL 9 HARD


WINDOWS USERS:

     Wolf3D can be run under windows enhanced mode if you run Wolf3D
from a PIF file. Set the minimum and maximum amount of XMS to use so
that they are equal. For example, set both min and max to 1024. Note
that swapping tasks may cause Wolf3D to loose its video memory,
causing "junk" to appear on the screen.
