Hello again, DHWs.  This is Tricob, known in the YouTube world as Tricob1974.

I've decided to provide you all with a "sneak peak" at some of the smaller features 
of my "Base Of Operations" source code, built from the Wolf4SDL engine.  All its 
options can be turned on or off by making small changes to the H files.  No more 
digging in the middle of a CPP file to change what you want;  Par Times, music order, 
episode names, "Read This!" features, Seamless Levels, and more can all be changed 
or enabled/disabled through the H files.

The first two EXEs are for the 10-level Shareware version of Wolf3D.  Both EXEs have 
Seamless Levels enabled, but one version has the EndTexts and "Read This!" feature 
disabled;  great for running Shareware mods!  The files included here are from Mr. 
Wolf's second mapset.

The last EXE is for the Spear Of Destiny demo.

All three EXEs have the "Doom Music" feature enabled.  What does that do?  I'm not 
sure how to describe it well, but "die" in a game, or load up a game to appear in 
a different area of the same level, and you'll see what I mean.

Other features include "Smart weapon pickup", where - if you already have the chaingun 
*and* full ammo - the weapon isn't picked up (thus saving ammo).

Thank you for reading this, and enjoy the EXEs.  :-)

- Tricob.
