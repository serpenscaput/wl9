STORY: 

Noah is lounging in his study, reading a facsinating article reguarding the health benifits of a raw meat diet, when suddenly he hears a crash and the soft patter of little footsteps from oustide his door. 
He opens it to investigate this disturbance, finding that the monkey twins, Melvin and Bobo, have broken out of their cage and are now wreaking havoc across the whole ark. Noah can imagine it, countless amounts 
of animals being freed from their cages by this devious duo, countless amounts of mess that he will have to endure. With a sigh of resignation Noah returns to his study, reaching under his desk to retrieve his 
ever handy slingshot. Noah has a new goal in mind now, stop the monkey duo and save the ark from total chaos.
