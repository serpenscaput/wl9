Hitler's Ark
by Dr. Chainsaw Studios '07

Story;
Like every other mod the war proved to be a real bitch to Hitler and pals. 
Inspired by Noah's Ark he decided to take two of each nazis, 2 SS, 2 Officers etc 
and build an ark to escape.
However due to the toxic fumes of the labs the nazis started to reproduce at a rapid 
rate. 
It wasn't too long before they managed to burst out of their cages and wreck havoc 
on the ark.

There were two options for Hitler; Put the nazis down or put them to sleep. He was 
inspired by Super Noah's Ark 3D.
So he wipped out his sling shot and Axe and then grabbed some tranquilazers. "Hasta 
La Vista baby!"

You play the part of Hitler as you start from the bottom floor of the ark right to 
the deck. Godd Luck!
