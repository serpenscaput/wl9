The HoS Maps:

Greetings,

Since we can't give you the actual HoS maps (that is, within the HoS environment), you are going to have to settle for a slack set of maps converted to SoD format.  The original maps are encrypted into the game and can't be extracted unless you are as cunning as the Choksta - lol.

A few things worth mentioning:

- I didn't spend a lot of time converting these maps - didn't see the need.  The wall textures have been changed so that they don't clash too badly and some of the objects were adjusted to fit in with the overall theme.  Hopefully I didn't place any walls on top of any objects - lol.
- There are no special weapons or damaging sprites in this set, which SEVERELY affects game play.  This set isn't really meant to be played anyway.  It is being released in case you are stuck or want to find all the secrets.
- Obviously, this set requires the registered SoD to play.  Ergo, all the standard cheats and command line parameters work.

Have fun,
ack
