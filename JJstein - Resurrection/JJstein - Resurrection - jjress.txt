JJStein: Resurrection (Demo Version)
By JJ Erickson

Here are 3 new levels. They are episode one - levels 1, 2 and secret. Levels on the 
other 5 episodes have been removed.

There are some new graphics and sounds but overall the atmosphere of the original 
game remains. 

There are some basic source code changes such as increased ammo/health, ceiling colors 
and changed episode names etc. The ILM cheat and debugmode have been changed too. 


Beware of the crosses. They have changed color and are now landmines!!

Enjoy!!
