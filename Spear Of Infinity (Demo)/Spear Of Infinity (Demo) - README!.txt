Weapons, Objects, Enemies and Bosses

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weapons:

Golden Luger: A golden gun! BJ´s dream comes true! It has a strong firepower which 
blows guards away.

Golden M16: A golden Rifle! Can it get any better? (yes it can) This weapon is full 
automatic
Which is very usefull against hordes of enemy's.

Golden Chaingun: A full gold chain gun! whoohoo!
This weapon is the best in-game. It has the power to blow away enemy's in mere seconds.

It has 1 downside. It eats ammo like crazy, so don't use it to much.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objects:

Micro health box: heals 3% health
Medium health box: heals 10% health
Golden health box: heals a whopping 25% health!
Gold extra-life: heals 100%, extra life and 25 ammo! This is a very usefull item, 
so it's limited!
Ammo clip: gain 8 ammo
Golden Ammo box: gain 25 ammo!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Enemies and Bosses:

Normal guard: the plain old brown guard... this guy is so easy... no further explanation 
needed.
Elite SS: a SS in a new jacket! 
Officer: a officer in a new jacket!
Mutant: some of Dr Schabbs creations are still alive! and GOTT took them to his castle!


Metalman: GOTT created something even more fearfull then the Ubermutant from
Schabbs: A full Metalman!! Iwith his 2 chainguns and a speed that matches that with 
the 
Ubermutant, this guy isnt easy to defeat! (They say GOTT created more than 1 Metalman)


Ubermutant 2.0: GOTT still wasnt satisfied with Metalman, so he created 2.0! this

"bodyguard" has a double chain gun and a rocket launcher! For its brute power, 2.1

doesn't have the "ultimate" speed as Metalman does.

GOTT: Calling himself a "god" this man is no joke. he has matching powers as the 
grosse
familie and a hell lot of bodyguards at his disposal. This man is also responsible 
for hundreds
of murders and mutations, after all, this man was Schabbs his student...

GOTT Reborn: You thought you killed GOTT when you shot all of your bullets into him, 
but you
were wrong. Elite SS brought him to the top room where he was regenerating to face 
you
again. This time, he has a couple of rocket launchers mounted on his shoulders and 
(of course)
2 chainguns.

Golden Angel of death: As you fought him before, GOTT also met him! But as mentally

insane as he is, he brought the angel back to life as his "#1" bodyguard. Luckily 
the angel did
not agree and he was sealed away with the spear (as he was first). The only wounds 
the 
angel has is His new shiny gold/silver skin which GOTT operated on him. Oh yeah, 
good 
luck beating your old rival again.

Special notes: 

MLI does work, but you're not a good gamer if you use it...
lvl 2 isnt finished yet, need some decorations to do and that stuff, and it has almost 
18 pushwalls, find them all!
The demo was released for the purpose of showing the graphics i gonna use (may be 
changed in the future).
