TimbuktuVersion 2.0October 21, 2001By Ken Rohrerkenroar@yahoo.comAs you are reading the paper and worrying about the latest anthrax scare, you are suddenly transported against your will to a strange building. You are desperate to get out somehow. You try many doors and also discover secret passageways on your way. Drat! Those pesty soldiers try to put a bullet through you. You discover guns, ammunition, and grenade launchers. Even though you aren't a violent person you know that you have to kill to stay alive.What? You're fenced in. Someone turned out the lights. You find that you can push open the gates and escape. Just when you think you are home free, giant robots try to blast you to Timbuktu. If you can just get to the last door....if you can just make it...-------      ----------     ----------     ----------    ---------    ----------Put Timbuktu into your Levels folder.
