Its based on wolf3d.
It was the first mod I did!
The only thing thats new made is

Ok its based upon Nintendo.
And it was made to make fun of Nintendo.
After playing Nintendos games in the gone years of 80´s
I thoughts to my self why not make a mod of it so here it is! 

       New things!
* Walls
* Hans Grosse
* Weapons and stuff
