NOTES:
- All other maps have been erased. Only the first 3 are available and accessible from the first episode.
- There are not coding changes, so this is playable in DOS, SDL, & EC/LZWolf
- There is one notable bug, in which the gray wall will appear in places where it should not. To remedy this, try restarting thw whole game.
