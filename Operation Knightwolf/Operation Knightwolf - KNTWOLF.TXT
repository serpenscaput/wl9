          Welcome to the add-on! Thanks for taking the time to download 
     and play this 10 level set for the registered version of Wolfenstein 3D! 
     
          This set was created using the DOS utilities Wolfedit, Wolfsnd, and
     Mapedit 8.4. Graphics were modified using PaintShop 4.0 and Adobe
     PhotoShop 5.0. Sound editing was accomplished with CoolEdit 95 and
     Voxkit from Creative Labs. Many significant changes have been made to 
     the VSWAP file to create the atmosphere I wanted, but this is not a
     "total conversion" as such. I took the direction that not many seem to 
     go- retro scenery as opposed to "futuristic" or "mech" story lines. 
     I did, however, feel it was fair to make all the sound changes, since 
     it helps to enhance this levels-only gameset.

          All graphics and sprite changes are originals by me, with the 
     exception of the nice red brick and toilet gifs, which came from an
     earlier set by B.J. Rowan. I have tried very hard not to simply "copy"
     other peoples level layouts, but to present original ideas here.

          As others have said before me, you may use any images or sounds
     from this, as long as credit goes where it is due. Thanks to Brian Lowe
     for the German translation help.

          The story is: you are being held in an old castle; very old, with
     some ghostly inhabitants still lurking. Some soldiers went missing when
     the Germans took it over, presumably while on recons into the reaches of
     the castle treasure and ball rooms. You will, as always, attempt to 
     escape, and while doing so you will discover these secrets.

          There are 10 levels, 9 regular and a secret one. Many levels have
     hidden keys. Some have "arsenals", medical areas, dining halls, etc.
     The zombies are used here to...grow those green plants?!! (They are 
     subjects of the greenhouse areas).

          The levels are:
                          1. "Initial Escape"
                          2. "The Mines"
                          3. "The Hub"
                          4. "Hidden Spectres"
                          5. "Force of Will"
                          6. "Confrontation"
                          7. "Beer Halls"
                          8. "Upper Caches"
                          9. "The Throne"
                     Secret. "Greenhouse"

           I have designed this set with the old v.1.1 registered set. This 
      has been done because I run into fewer problems with audio editing 
      than the GT CDROM v 1.4. I have play tested these levels on a DOS
      platform 486 DX66 and a Pentium 233MMX with Win98- They seem to be bug-
      -free. If you run in to problems, please email me. I would consider it
      a real pleasure to hear from you regarding what you did or didn't like
      about the levels. Anyway...go, shoot'em up, rip'em a new one...just 
      have fun. And Thanks.
