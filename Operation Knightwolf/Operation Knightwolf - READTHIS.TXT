     Welcome, and thanks for downloading these first few levels of my
 Wolfenstein adventure. I've been enjoying other people's levels and
 gamesets for years, and felt it was time to start giving back a little!
 
     I am a novice at level building, but I've tried to make these 
 somewhat interesting- changing some graphics, sounds, etc., without 
 totally abandoning the original games concept. I am trying to follow a 
 theme...since we always seem to deal with castles, I've tried to add a 
 "medieval" flavor to them. 

     Our hero, B.J., is held in a cell in the bowels of a castle, deep
 in the Rhineland. However, it is not just occupied by his captures...
 some of the original inhabitants are still around, sealed off after 
 some brown guards "disappeared" while reconning some treasure rooms.
 He must not only escape, but deal with some of the spectral guests to
 complete his escape.

     These are the first levels of what I want to complete as a multi-
 episode set. I really would appreciate some credible, constructive 
 feedback to help me develope the idea and concept to a better result.
 please email me to let me know.

     This level set requires the registered version of Wolfenstein. It 
was modified using mapedit 8.4, wolfsnd, and wolfedit 4.2. This set
consists of 4 regular and 1 secret level. The secret level is available
from level 1. Simply rename the files with extension ".KWF" to ".WL6",
then copy them over your existing maphead, vswap, and gamemaps files. Be
sure you keep a safety copy of your original game.

     I have tested these levels and found them to work well, Please inform
me of any bugs you find.

     Watch for the "Armory" rooms, and the hidden treasure rooms; some of 
the keys are hidden! 

     The nice redbrick, and toilet, is by B.J. Rowan. Other graphics and
sound changes were done by me.
