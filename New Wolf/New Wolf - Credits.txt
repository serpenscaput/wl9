   This is my first effort at doing a wolf set on my own. My previous efforts:
Deathcastle, Return to Death Castle, Nazi Ambush, and Heinmakker, all consisted of 
a
large amount of work by my grandfather. Just as Mr. Lowe and Harry Mass Sr. helped 
my grandfather,
they have provided some assistance to me also. I also have recieved help from 
Tristan Van Putten,(The music changes)Mr. Ken O'Brien,(the "pill box") and Chris 
Chokan (a LARGE amount
of moral support and his own brand of Wolf-humor).I have utilized a lot of graphics 
changes in this set,
most of which is my own work. There are some other changes which the credit goes 
to the following:
 The WAY KEWL Credit/Tribute screen: Brent (XBintercepter)
 The Pill Boxes: Ken O'Brien
 Grey Wall#1 Shading and New Banner: Tristan Van Putten
 Toilet fixtures: Harry Mass Sr.
 Levels 13 and 15: Brian Lowe
 Some of the music coding ideas: Tristan Van Putten

And Last, but certainly not least, my Grandfather, the late Robert Thomas Lindsey 
Sr.
 who turned me on to this incredibly cool game and showed me its secrets...
