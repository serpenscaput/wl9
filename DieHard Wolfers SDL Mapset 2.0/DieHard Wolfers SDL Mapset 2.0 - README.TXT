The DHW SDL Mapset                                        05 January 2011

Dedicated to Liza Walley


Here's a new mapset by a team of DieHard Wolfers, ready for playing in the
New Year.  Use DHWSDL.exe for playing in Windows with the Wolf4SDL engine
created by Ripper. If you don't have Windows yet, or just want to play the
DOS version, use wolf3d.exe.  There's no need to delete config files or
saved games; both versions can co-exist in the same folder.  You *will*
have to provide your own registered wolf3d audio and vswap files though.

Here's the line up:

Episode 1 - ronwolf1705 
Episode 2 - AReyeP      
Episode 3 - serpens     
Episode 4 - Thomas      
Episode 5 - Dean, Arielus, and Schabbs *
Episode 6 - ack         

* Level 1 - Arielus
  Level 2 - Arielus
  Level 3 - Schabbs
  Level 4 - Arielus
  Level 5 - Dean
  Level 6 - Schabbs
  Level 7 - Dean
  Level 8 - Arielus
  Level 9 - Dean
  Level 10 - Dean

EXE by Andy Nonymous

Because we wanted to make this as "pure Wolf3d" as possible, there have
been minimal changes to the EXE. Pushwalls will always move three spaces,
par times have been altered, and the hitwall and spacebar sounds have been
silenced, though Tab+S will toggle them back on if you miss that oldschool
noise!

Thanks to:

  id Software for releasing the Wolf3d source code
  Ripper for creating the Wolf4SDL engine to play Wolf3d in Windows
  Brian Lowe for hosting this at the Wolf3d Dome

Enough reading...start playing!
