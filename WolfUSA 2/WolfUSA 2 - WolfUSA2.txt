WolfUSA2 - by Fred Kenny 

Thank you for downloading this add-on for Wolfenstein 3D. The full version of the 
game is needed to play.

This zip file contains GAMEMAPS.WL6, MAPHEAD.WL6, VSWAP.WL6 and WolfUSA2.TXT. Please 
do not distribute this set with any other files added.

This set has the same maps as on Wolffred, ie - there are 10 new levels on episode 
three, started by Fred Kenny and completed by Brian Lowe. Some later normal levels 
have bosses, usually Hans Grosse. All other episodes have some alterations done by 
Fred Kenny, particularly episode one. 

The main difference between this set and Wolffred is the new wall designs (which 
are all combinations of red, white and blue - hence the title), and actors/treasures. 
They are now mainly by Fred Kenny.  

Thanks go to those at id software for producing such a great game and without which 
this add-on would not be possible.
