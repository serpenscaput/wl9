"Spear Of Infinity" - A game by Hellblazer, Which is my sequel to Spear of Destiny.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Story:

The Spear of Destiny, said to have stabbed Jesus Christ, is considered
to be the most powerful object on the planet. However, there is another
spear that has only been referred to on a single occasion: the beginning.
No one knows of this spear, that has stabbed the Lord himself: The Spear of 
Infinity.

Five months after B.J. Blazkowicz secured the Spear Of Destiny, a young man,
who will be referred to as 'The Hero' by the nazi's, did some research on
artifacts of old. He was fascinated by them, almost as much as he was
fascinated about the Third Reich. When he reached the data about the Spear
Of Destiny, a voice in his head called him. It asked The Hero to go to
the remnants of Castle Wolfenstein. The voice sounded familiar to The Hero, 
and he didn't have anything better to do, so he went to the once so great Castle

Wolfenstein, which is now in ruins. What happened when he arrived, is
something that has never happened before: the ground split open and a 
mysterious staircase had appeared.

The Hero could not believe his eyes. After looking at the stairs for a minute
he decides to walk down the stairs out of curiosity, which he wouldn't regret.
Once at the bottom level, he encounters a shrine, with a mysterious object
among all the gold surrounding it. The object had a certain glow around it 
that almost blinded The Hero. Once he approached it, he said to himself: it's
the Spear Of Destiny! 

Knowing the Spear Of Destiny had mysterious powers, The Hero tried to grab
the Spear. The split second The Hero touched the 'Spear Of Destiny' he was 
overwhelmed by the powersurge that went through him and fell on the ground.
Once The Hero opened his eyes, he saw a mysterious figure floating before 
him. The floating figure said "You who have touched the Spear Of Infinity,
will be able to experience your true dream." 

You, B.J. Blazkowicz, received a call from an old friend residing in Germany,
saying that a couple of mysterious castles suddenly appeared at the spot
where Castle Wolfenstein was before it got destroyed in the war. You 
question the message of your friend and asked how suddenly it appeared. 
When your friend said a few moments ago, you rushed your way to the Spear
Of Destiny, which now resides quite close to you in the militairy base of
The Allied Forces who stayed behind after the war. You're the only one who
had the rights to touch the Spear, since you were the one who saved it.
You saw the Spear resting in its high-securety case. Once your ID was 
recognized, you touched the Spear to see if it played a part of the 
mysterious message your friend told you.

A few moments later, B.J. asked someone at the militairy base to fly him to
his friend in Germany. Knowing what happened in Germany thanks to the Spear
Of Destiny, B.J. was determined to save the world for an upcoming threat, a
threat set in motion by a being who commanded the Angel Of Death himself, 
which also was the floating creature which spoke to The Hero.
You also know what person The Hero brought back, and some memories of the
past makes you shiver, because you could never forget the battle that took 
place back then...

After you arrive at your friend in Germany, you find his house busted
open and full of holes. You gaze at the enormous structures in the distant,
of about 2km in size, and know your mission. You hit a cross with your hand
for your fallen friend, take your trusted knife with you, and enter the first
structure in front of you, named Area Of The Prototype. You sneak your way
to the entrance, and see a golden Luger with some bullets on the floor. 
You get a chill of awesomeness when you grab the luger, but quickly get
reminded of your mission when you notice a few guards walking in front of you.

Your adventure begins!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Weapons:

Golden Luger: A golden gun! BJ´s dream comes true!

Golden M16: A golden Rifle! This weapon is fully automatic and is recommended
for low amounts of enemies.

Golden Chaingun: A golden chain gun!
This weapon is the best in-game. It has the power to blow away enemies in 
mere seconds. It has 1 downside. It eats ammo like crazy, so don't use it 
in situations where using the M16 should do the job.

Objects:

Micro health box:  heals 3% health
Medium health box: heals 10% health
Golden health box: heals 25% health
Extra-life: heals 100%, grants an extra life and 25 ammo
Ammo clip: gain 8 ammo
Ammo box: gain 25 ammo

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Enemies and Bosses:

Normal guard: can be taken down fairly quickly, still has a nice jacket.
Elite SS: Equipped with a golden M16, these guys are no joke. 
Officer: A high ranked nazi, which are faster than a regular guard.
Wasted Mutant: The Hero found the mutants used by Shabbs useful enough to
let them return, only with a different look and a different structure.

Death-Head: One of The Hero his dream was to experience the mutants himself.
These dreams granted the world the ungodly being known as the 'Death-Head'
which has been approved by The Hero as protector of his castle. You heard
one guard talking about multiple Death-Heads in other structures, mainly
in The Hero's castle and the research area.

Uses two chainguns.

The Mutant King: Wanting an ultimate body guard, The Hero made the scientists
make the mutant 'Alpha' which would have a speech pattern also 
understandable to humans. When all the weapons and half of the speech
device were installed in Alpha, it gained a consciousness that didn't please
The Hero. The mutant went on a rampage killing many researchers and one of
The Hero's highest ranked general, General Ubergrabber. He then started a 
revolution, taking a lot of mutants with his cause for world domination.
He now calls himself the Mutant King, and needs to be put down aswell, or 
else the whole world will be populated by mutants!

Uses two chainguns and a chest-mounted rocket launcher.

The Hero: Corrupted by his new found powers, The Hero now refers himself as
GOTT. The man behind the revival of the most dangerous human who ever roamed
the planet is here. His appearance matches that of Trans Grosse, one of The
Hero's role models, only with gold glowing eyes which can only be obtained
when influenced by the Spear Of Infinity and a golden suit (The Hero loves
gold). This man is an extremely dangerous threat to the planet and needs
to be shut down quickly, and the only person who can do that is you! B.J
Blazkowicz!

Uses two chainguns, but his godly powers made him able to move way faster 
than any enemy seen before!

Adolf Hitler: The person revived by The Hero is none other than the Führer
himself: Adolf Hitler. Adolf now has glowing eyes and a body capable of 
carrying two chainguns and two rocket launchers thanks to the Spear Of
Infinity's power. The Hero prepared the floor for Adolf Hitler himself, 
and Hitler was pleased with the loyalty of The Hero. Hitler plans to 
take over the world with his new army, and bring Germany to the
greatness he thinks it deserves. If you do not stop him right now B.J. 
then the whole world will be in danger once again, so you must do everything
to stop Adolf Hitler wreak havoc again!  

King of Angels: The protector of the Spear Of Destiny, the Angel of Death,
was nothing more than a mere servant of the being who controls hell itself.

The Hero had one last surprise for you should things go downward. He made it 
so that if anyone other than The Hero or Hitler would touch the spear, he 
would be teleported to the lair of the King of Angels himself and fight
the four strongest creatures The Hero dreamed of and the King of Angels
aswell. This will be the ultimate challenge, the fate of the world depends
on this battle, are you ready? B.J. Blazkowicz?
