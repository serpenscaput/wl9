ENDING

You've destroyed Castle Lost. The final HQ for the remnants of the SS. Congratulations! 
Now that the SS have few officers, fewer guards, and are very disorganized, Hitler 
is now in a highly vulnerable position. If only you knew where the bastard was hiding, 
you'd kill him yourself.. But that's another story, right? You have a strange feeling 
in your stomach that Himmler is still alive though, and that the SS are planning 
a counterattack on you with all that they've got, and more... 
You just can't believe that you've really destroyed the SS, but your superiors state 
otherwise, so only time will tell..

Thanks for playing SS: Castle Lost! Stay tuned for my future projects:

- SS 2 (In planning stages)
- Grabendolch (In development)
- And much more to come!

and also stay tuned for ThunderEnema's "Beyond the Grave" a game I've been doing 
a lot of artwork for!

DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you
are expected to register. Individual programs differ on details --
some request registration while others require it, some specify a
maximum trial period. With registration, you get anything from the
simple right to continue using the software to an updated program
with printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and
the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors area ccomplished
programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are of
comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs and bad
ones!) The main difference is in the method of distribution. The
author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute the
software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For
example, some authors require written permission before a commercial
disk vendor may copy their Shareware. 

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.


DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

Users of this program must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
this program is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or conse-
quential, which may result from the use of this program."

This program is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to
the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends,
but please do not give it away altered or as part of another system.
The essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal
computer users with quality software without high prices, and yet to
provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
products.  If you find this program useful and find that you are
using this program and continue to use this program after a
reasonable trial period, you must either send us a postcard as
described above or order one of the series of games described in
ORDER.FRM. The registration fee will license one copy for use on any
one computer at any one time. You must treat this software just like
a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any number
of people and may be freely moved from one computer location to
another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one
location while it's being used at another. Just as a book cannot be
read by two different persons at the same time. 

You are encouraged to pass a copy of this program along to your
friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
copy if they find that they can use it.
