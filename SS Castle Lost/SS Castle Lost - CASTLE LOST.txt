After blazing through Castle Fefehlbuchstabiersburg, killing Heinrich Himmler and 
his most trusted SS personnel, you receive word from the underground that there is 
yet another castle, the castle with no name. The SS dubs it as, "Castle Verloren", 
"Castle Lost". Himmler had a strange obsession with this mysterious castle, and was 
just returning from it the very day you killed him. The castle is very huge, but 
only 2 portions of the castle are being used for SS activities. To make sure the 
SS never rise again, you grasp your handgun, and sneak into a near window, a guard 
is standing just inches from you, what ever will you do?

SS - Castle Lost is a SOD demo map set. I made it just for fun. I hope you enjoy 
it!
