		       DARK DUNGEON II
		    Wolfenstein add-on by
			 Kenny Roels
		 ---------------------------


I'm Kenny (14 years old) and have created this Wolfenstein
addon with:	Mapedit 8.4 > Levels
		Wolfedit 2.0 > Graphics
		Goldwave (and soundedit) > Sounds

DD II

This is, from what I think a GREAT 'Wolf' !
There are 6 episodes that you can play: 3 episodes of 9
levels, 2 episodes with 6 levels and 1 episode with only
one level. That means that there are 40 LARGE levels !_!_!_!
The games is graphically much improved.

This are changes I made:

	* Much new good graphics
	* Many new walls
	* The pistol is changed and the knife is a fist
	* The mutant is replaced by an other guard
	* Four new bosses: your Evil Twin Brother, the Gost, Schabbs' 
          his father & Flote Grosse.
	* There are many new objects
	* The soldiers and the officers have an higher IQ
	* And -Oooh Yes!!! > NEW SOUNDS < All original !
	* 40 New butt-kicking levels

Because I'm only 14 years old I didn't do any source code chanches, but
with even that my addon is much better than some addons I have seen. I 
have seen much worse!
If you want to use my graphics or/and sounds then please contact met at kennox@belgacom.net 
and give me credits in your readme file.
