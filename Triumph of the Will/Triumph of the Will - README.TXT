Hey fellow wolfers,

Another Mac-enstein 3-D adventure... Triumph of the Will!
With new levels by ponz. To keep from spoiling any surprises,
tutorials by others have been listed at the end of this README.

As this is a Mac-enstein episode, we tried to remain true to the Mac engine
feel and graphics. As such there are no advanced floor or ceiling effects,
or total graphics changes as you might see in other mods or TC's.

Yet the Mac engine does have advanced features the original PC version
didn't have, such as high-resolution sprites and player projectile weapons,
different music and sound effects, and more.

We have strived to create a quality mod with maps that are occasionally
tricky, sometimes suprising, and hopefully challenging to play even for
experienced DieHardWolfers everywhere.

It is our hope that you find this Mac-enstein episode fun... enjoy!

-ponz and Andy
