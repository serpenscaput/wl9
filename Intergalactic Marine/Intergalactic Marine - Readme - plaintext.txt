INTERGALACTIC MARINE - README

STORY:
The year is 3198, and the human race is engulfed with an alien race called the Zkraaz. 
The war
has been raging for years, but the humans finally invented a new weapon, Cybernetic 
Marines.
These Marines can push themselves harder and further then any other creature. Equipped

with a blade built into their hands and a scanner in their new eyes, the CM - Units 
are the
dominant force on any battlefield.

CM - Units pushed the Zkraaz forces to a distant planet in the Rigel Solar System. 
Although
the scanners read only a few Zkraaz forces, the scanners were unable to detect the 
secret
base that was already established here by the Zkraaz.

11 CM piloted Dropships made their descent to the planet, unfortunately the LZs were 
hot
ones. Luckily, your engine suffered damage and you overshot the LZs. You are the 
only
survivor, going up against an army of Zkraaz. You are CM - 023, do you have what 
it
takes to defeat your enemies, Marine?
