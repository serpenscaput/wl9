SPEARPAK 2
compiled by Sam Feichter (AstroCreep)



[Changes from originals]
HiRes Textures and Sprites from my Mac GFX Pack, all other sprites from PSTroopers 
Sprite Fix Pack
Edited a few walls, for some reason some of these had unknown wall types, which is 
odd since none of these had source hacks.  The unknown walls would crash the game

Various fixes
Crackhead bitches
