   IT IS 3 DAYS SINCE YOU ESCAPED THE HELLHOLE CASTLE GOTTENHEIMER.
 YOU ARE SITTING IN A DUSSELDORF PUB SIPPING SOME 
OF THE FINEST SCHNAPPS YOU HAVE EVER TASTED.
 OUT OF THE CORNER OF THE ROOM COMES AN ARGUMENT FROM A COUPLE OF FARMERS
TALKING ABOUT A PAIR OF DEAD NAZI GUARDS THEY FOUND
 ON THEIR FARM LOCATED TO THE EAST NEAR THE OLD ABANDONED CASTLE GOTTSPEAR.
BUTTING INTO THE CONVERSATION, YOU DISCOVER THAT THERE HAS BEEN
 SOME STRANGE ACTIVITIES GOING ON AROUND THE OLD CASTLE. LOCATED 
IN A DRY LAKE BED, THE CASTLE WAS FLOODED FOR YEARS AND NO-ONE EVER WENT THERE.
 IT SEEMS IN RECENT MONTHS, SEVERAL BODIES HAVE
TURNED UP IN THE AREA, SO MUTILATED AS TO BE UNRECOGNIZABLE.
 THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE BODIES WERE NAZI GUARDS SPARKS YOUR INTEREST 
AND YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE......JUST WHAT YOU NEED, RIGHT?
 ANOTHER DAMP, LEAKY, DRAFTY OLD CASTLE FULL OF MURDERING NAZI SCUM...
GO NOW AND DISCOVER WHATS BEEN DOING THE KILLING.
LEADING TO A CONFRONTATION WITH THE FACE OF ULTIMATE EVIL....
