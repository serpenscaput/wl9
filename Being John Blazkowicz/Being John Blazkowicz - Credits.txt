The mod is based on AryanWolf3D's Wolf4SDL source code

Coding: 
Poet's code on disabling death cam & bosses dropping keys
Chris', KyleRTCW's and Andy_Nonymous' code on seamless level progression and final ratio calculation
Adam Biser's, Wolf Skevos-Jones', Chris' and KyleRTCW's code on displaying map names
Wolf Skevos-Jones' code on displaying ingame messages
MCS's code on the enemy blocking object

Custom music (there aren't too many this time), custom walls, custom cultist enemy (fake hitler), custom Cyborg Soldat boss:
Orka - that's me :)

Barnacle Wilhelm fix:
Wolf3DGuy

Thanks to:
Team Straycats for helping me figuring out and cleaning up my mistakes in the code.
(Untergang is the best wolfenstein mod ever. Even better than Blade of Agony.)
