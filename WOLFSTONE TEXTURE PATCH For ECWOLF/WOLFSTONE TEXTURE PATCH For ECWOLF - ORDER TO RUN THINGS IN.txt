In order for the new textures to appear in game , you must run them in the order listed.

1. Allied Powers Textures .PK3

2. Wolfstone .PK3 (it must be the version of Wolfstone thats in this zip file otherwise it won't work

3. Wolfstone Resources .PK3

Drag and drop them into ECWOLF , and the textures will appear in game.

-Enjoy!
