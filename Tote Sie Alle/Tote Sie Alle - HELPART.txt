^C7cWelcome ^C00
Thank you for downloading my first mod!

^P^
^C7cThis mod includes a huge amount of content: ^C00
-New enemies
-New Sprites
-New Sounds
-New Weapons
-New Music
-And much more!

^C7cThe Secret Level Problem: ^C00
So, I decided to add a secret weapon exclusive to the secret level.
This weapon is too powerful and would make the game too easy if the player
were to have it during a playthrough.
I have no idea how to take away weapons from players at the beginning of a level.
Let me be clear! The player is only supposed to use this secret weapon
while playing the secret level, ^C[Dark Red]NO OTHER WEAPONS.
^P^
^C00So there are some requests that I have, if you manage to find the secret level.
Since this weapon is only meant for the secret level, I would
appreciate it if you emptied all of the ammo before proceeding.
And like I said in the last page, ^C[Dark Red]DO NOT ^C00use any other weapon while
playing the secret level. By the way the secret exit is in map 03, not 01, if you even care.

Thank you for taking time to read my crappy little info booklet.
Also if there are any bugs or problems with this mod, I apologise. I know it
was not the smartest idea to have this big ass mod for being my first one. I do
have to say I am proud of it, even if there may be some flaws.
Now, get out there and kick some nazi ass!
