^C38 STORY

^C3B Captains Log, 23XX...

A malfunctioning droid has severely bonked his head against the Hyper Transwarp chamber, 
causing it to shut down. The local Borg colony saw it's chance and boarded the ship 
by surprise.

They took us completely by storm.

We hope that they didn't do too much damage, as we were already weakened by the battle 
against the Caitians...
