	Dedicated to Wade. Your memory will live on forever in Eat At Joes!

	Eat At Joe's 2: Joe's Revenge is the product of about 5 years of
	"hard" work. And by hard we mean getting bored with the project,
	forgetting about the project, trying to remember where the backup
	CD went after remembering about the project, and so on.  We tried
	to credit as many people as we could remember for their help with
	this project, but it would be impossible to name everyone. So, if
	you helped in even the remotest way, but are not formally thanked:
	Thank You For Everything! There have been good times and bad, 
	friends have come and gone, but now we are proud to present 
	- a tie (with EAJ1) for the greatest Wolfenstein Total Conversion *EVER* 
	- a game saga that started with a Chritmas card 
	Eat At Joe's: Joe's Revenge!
				~The Eat At Joe's 2 Team, Dec 3rd 2005~

Story: In Eat At Joes 1 you found Joe's. You broke in and stole some jewels, 
       ammo, & food. Then you left.
       Well, Joe got a little pissed off and flipped out. He started on a 
       wild rampage killing people and such. Now its your job to find Joe 
       and stop him!

Backgroung: Ok, you start just inside the back of Joe's.  When you found 
       Joe's last time you found a secret door, but never went in etc etc.  
       Anywho, you got a pistol and a few bullets... Now go for it!

How to play: Eat At Joes 2 is a total conversion of the game "Wolfenstein
       3d" so the controls are the same. Use the arrows to move, ctrl to
       shoot, alt + left/right to strafe, 1/2/3/4 as weapon selection,
       and space to open.

If you have Windows XP or Windows 2000: Eat At Joes 2 uses a game "engine"
	that is not made for Windows after Windows ME. Sometimes this can
	cause problems. If you have Windows 2000 or XP try using DosBox.
	Visit the EAJ website (http://www.angelfire.com/oh3/eatatjoes)
	and click on the 'Eat At Joes 2' link for instructions on setting
	up DosBox to load EAJ2!

About source code changes:
	We take no credit for any source code changes.  All source code changes,
	including setting up the compiler, were copied out of tutorials. Because
	of the long time it took to complete Eat At Joe's 2, credit for the
	original creators of those tutorials has been lost. A big thank you goes
	out to everyone who had tutorials online between 2000 and 2003.
