This is only a demo version of Missing in action. The full version
will be avalible soon.The guns will be further changed and the enemies 
also in the final version.I dont mind people using the images from this
game as long as they credit me. If you have made an improvement on my
game, contact me and I'll include it if its good enough in the final 
version giving you credit.Included is wolfedit and mapedit.

Note : Most of the images in this game are original , but there are a 
few exceptions:

1) the tank boss in the demo is a modified tank from luke struassmans
wolfenstein special edition.


2)My new chaingun is a heavily modified gun from perfection darkenstein
by Kody ? but i assure you that it is almost totally different in every
way. I'm only including this because without seeing the gun, i could 
never have modified it for better or worse.


New features in the Demo :

' All new weapons, fist, sniper rifle, m-50 and the Chaincannon
' Some new enemies - wehrmacht military police (modified zombies)
' New objects - captured allied soldiers
' New maps - Six test maps in the demo ( all easy but will be modified)
' New sounds - various

The finished game will be out soon and will be greatly improved, so 
dont base your opinion on this( but if you like it, hey.....).I'm still 
trying to work the damn source code as well..................

Thanks,

David Nevin
