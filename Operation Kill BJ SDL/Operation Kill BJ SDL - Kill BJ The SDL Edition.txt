"Operation: Kill BJ! - SDL Edition v1.11"

Hello again, DHWs.  This is Tricob, known in the YouTube world as Tricob1974.

Say hello to "Operation: Kill BJ! - The SDL Edition".  This is a Windows-compatible 
version of "Operation: Kill BJ!".  It uses the source code of "Tricob's Base Of Operations" 
as a base.

This mod has 60 levels in all.  Most of these maps are hacks of the maps from "Operation: 
Kill BJ!" and the Wolf3D Community Map Pack.

Of the "Operation: Kill BJ!" maps, I took all the parts that were "too hard" and 
either replaced them, or made them easier to beat.  Maps for E1L1, E6L7, and E6L8 
are completely new.  Lastly, over half of E5L10 is redone.

Feel free to use this game's files as a base to make your own mods, but please give 
credit where credit's due.

Thank you for reading this, and enjoy the mod.

v1.11:  Numerous bugs - including the "Ready" animation bug - are now fixed.  Saved 
games should not be affected.

- Tricob.

P.S.  Useless trivia:  This project was called "Kill BJ Revamped" in WIP versions.
