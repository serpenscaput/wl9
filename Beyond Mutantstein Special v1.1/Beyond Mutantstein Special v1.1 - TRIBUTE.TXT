BEYOND MUTANTSTEIN SPECIAL EDITION - A Tribute to John Bucksnort

We hope you enjoy this tribute game to John Bucksnort! John was 80 years of age, yes, that's right, 80! Yet he was a keen Wolfer who enjoyed making a large range of add ons for his favourite game, Wolfenstein 3D. Unfortunately, John passed away in 2001. Needless to say, it was a sad occasion for the small but dedicated Wolf 3D community. 

So well respected was John by so many in this community that it was decided a "tribute" game should be made to honour him. Being that one of John's favourite themes was based around the mutants from the original Wolfenstein 3D game, it was decided to make a tribute game based around the same theme, and so "Beyond Mutantstein Special Edition" came to be.

There are 21 levels in this Tribute game. They were made by a number of Wolf fans, lending a unique style to each level in the game. Those who contributed in various ways are listed below - thanks to all of you!
