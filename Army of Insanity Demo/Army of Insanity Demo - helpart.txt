^C[Red]ABOUT ^C[Green]ALPHASORAKUN

^C00I am an amateur modder hailing from the midwestern USA, hoping to redeem myself in terms of modding after many failed opportunities.

I also really enjoy Sonic the Hedgehog, Super Mario, Kingdom Hearts, and Super Smash Bros. though I mainly play FPS Games. I want to expand my variety when it comes to my projects.

^C[Red]ABOUT ^C[Green]ALPHASORAKUN

^C00The avatar you are looking at is me as a LEGO Figurine, and I was SSJKlonoa/TheSaiyanHog and various confusing names.

But anyways, onto the story at hand!

^C[DarkRed]THE STORY THUS FAR

^C00As you examine Erik Pride, you begin to feel something fishy is going on with this agent. Deckland tells you that he could POSSIBLY be a spy working for the Nazi Remnant.

Then, you proceed to ask Deckland. ^C[Green]"Who is this Erik Pride, and why does he want all of us dead?"

^C[DarkRed]THE STORY THUS FAR

^C00Looking for even more clues to this Erik Pride, you have now discovered the truth. He was a former Captain who presented a project for a "New World Order" to the President.

However, it was denied three times a charm.

As you look into security footage.

^C[DarkRed]THE STORY THUS FAR

^C00Nothing shows up. Not even a sign that he was responsible for going AWOL. Loading your supplies, you go and meet with the president, flying at high altitude to avoid being shot down, your plane is mysteriously destroyed and you barely escape.
