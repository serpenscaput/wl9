| TRISTANIA3D -- LIST OF SECRETS |
+--------------------------------+


Level 1: Preludium
==================

TOTAL SECRETS: 2

Secret #1:

When you follow the trail towards the gate, and confront the third Acolyte on the 
trail, carefully look the shrubbery on your left (if you face towards the direction 
of the gate, it should be on your left). There is a pine tree and a bald tree next 
to each other, plus two bushes. You can walk through these bushes and follow the 
narrow pathway to a dead Acolyte who has a dropped PCV and a 9mm clip.

Secret #2:

Once you entered the gate, kill the Acolytes, and look to the right. If you get around 
the shrubbery, you will find another wide open entrance through on the fence to a 
glade. Enter here, but be careful of Suicide Drones. Walk through the glade until 
you see yet another narrow trailway behind a small bush. Walk through the bush, and 
follow the path into a hidden part of the forest. Be on alert, as a Suicide Drone 
will charge at you. Once you have killed him, or suffered the consequences, look 
around - there is wormwood, a bag of gold, two crucifixes, some 9mm bullets, and 
a 9mm clip here.


Level 2: Perimeter
==================

TOTAL SECRETS: 7

Secret #1:

There should be a short fence near the graveyard right next to the castle's wall, 
where a wormwood can be picked up. Open the stone wall near the wormwood to find 
a small hidden nook with a PCV.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret #1 to access this secret.
This does not count as a secret, but it's still a hidden short-cut to the castle 
entrance. After you have picked up the pistol in the Secret area #1, push the wall 
right next to the pile of dirt - it will come out like a cork, letting you inside 
the blocked area with the many Acolytes and Drones. The narrow path leading into 
the falanster is just around the corner, so you don't have to fight your way through 
the perimeter to reach the exit.

Secret #3: 

This secret is only accessible, if you choose to stroll through the forest instead 
of entering the building.
Walk past the entrance into the castle, and carefully proceed forward. Take extra 
care - this route is filled with tripmines. Look at the castle's wall, you should 
see a gap. Mind that gap - there is a Suicide drone inside. Check the castle's wall 
BEFORE reaching this particular gap. A portion of the wall can be opened to a small 
nook with some 9mm bullets and three crucifixes.

Secret #4:

This secret is only accessible, if you choose to enter the castle instead of walking 
through the forest.
Once you have killed everybody at the outer battlement, you might want to check out 
the rampart, too. On your way to the rampart, you will notice that the left wall 
is diagonal (there is also heavy resistance at the rampart). Try pushing the walls 
right after the diagonal parts, there is a secret door which takes you into a short 
path between the castle walls. Inside, you will find your very first Suomi machinegun.


Secret #5:

This secret is only accessible, if you choose to enter the castle instead of walking 
through the forest.
After cleaning out the battlement, and proceeding forward, you will find a guard 
post on the right, there is a Drone inside with two torches, and fire is burning 
here. Push the wall next to the right torch to access the hidden part of the guard 
post with some 9mm bullets and an Artefact of Salvation.

Secret #6:

This secret is only accessible, if you choose to enter the castle instead of walking 
through the forest, AND you have found Secret area #5.
There is a small atrium with several stems of wormwood, and crucifixes, you might 
see it if you're walking through the forest. To access this small garden of solitude, 
you must push the right wall in Secret #5, where the pile of 9mm bullets is. It will 
open, and you can get inside the garden, and collect the wormwood & crucifixes.

Secret #7:

This secret is only accessible, if you choose to enter the castle instead of walking 
through the forest, AND you have found Secret area #6.
Once you are inside the garden, push the wall exactly opposite the bald tree. A hidden 
pathway will be revealed, leading you to a fissure gate, engulfed in flames, right 
at the castle wall. Enter the fissure gate, which'll briefly take you inside the 
building, to a dark, narrow corridor leading to a secret elevator. The elevator takes 
you to the first secret level - South side.


Level 3: Derelict
=================

TOTAL SECRETS: 13

Secret #1: 

When strolling through the narrow stone corridors, you'll eventually find a Suicide 
Drone at a dead end, and there is a wooden barricade nearby. Push the wall EXACTLY 
opposite the wooden barricade to find an abandoned corridor, with two rusty steel 
doors. Ready your weapon, as the area behind is NOT uninhabited - there is an Acolyte 
and a Black Apostle behind. Kill them, and then collect your reward - an Artefact 
of Salvation, two glasses of fine absinthe, a bottle of fine absinthe, a Lord's Supper, 
two crucifixes, and a Blood key.

Secret #2:

Head to the locked Bronze doors, and turn towards the derelict corridors. Look at 
the left and right walls - the left wall is clearly the castle's wall, while the 
right wall is made of interior cellar bricks, and a portion of the wall is clearly 
missing, compared to the left wall. THERE is the secret door. Open it, and have some 
hidden treasure, plus a Sabrine MK3!

Secret #3:

Enter the central dark derelict corridor, and choose the first door on your right. 
You will enter a small, bare room with a barrel and some bones. Look for a dead window 
on the wall, and push it. There is a hidden corridor with lots of golden chalices, 
and boxes of jewels inside.

Secret #5:

Push the holy cross between the two Drone warrens at the devastated coloumn hall 
to find two boxes of 12,6mm ammo.

Secret #6:

Enter the first Drone's warren, and check the left walls at the grate. You will find 
a hidden hole with 3 crowns.

Secret #7:

At the L-shaped corridor, there is a room with oil drums, with 9mm bullets inside. 
Now, head closer to the corner, while checking the walls after this room's door. 
Someone told me there is a secret ammo stash there with 9mm and 14mm ammunition...


Secret #8:

This one is almost next to the hidden ammunition stash of Secret #7. Go right into 
the corner, and check the walls to find a cave with an Artefact of Life inside.

Secret #9:

There is a short diagonal brickwall leading to the dead end of the north corridor. 
One of these diagonal wall portions is a secret door - there is a handful of hanging 
green vines nearby. If you successfully find the secret door, you can enter a small 
room with an Artefact of Regeneration.

Secret #10:

If you've successfully survived the cellar area, and picked up the Blood key, go 
through the rusty steel door at the end. You will be inside a short, diagonal corridor. 
Push the second portion of the wall on the right to find a hidden nook with a Backpack 
full of ammo!

Secret #11:

Almost exactly opposite Secret area #10. The left diagonal wall also has a hidden 
nook with 12,6mm ammunition. The secret door is marked with a pile of rubble.

Secret #12:

Just a bit further of the location mentioned above, you will arrive to an L-shaped 
corridor with black brick on the left, and there are quite a few Drones and Suicide 
drones here. At the end, you can grab a Sabrine MK3 and a 9mm clip. The end of the 
corridor has a secret door near the 9mm clip. A small bare room has two bottles of 
absinthe. 

Secret #13: 

This one is not a real secret, it is a hidden short-cut for Secret area #12. After 
the second intersection, you will notice a short corridor leading to north, with 
two doors on the left wall. Proceed through the corridor, and push the bottom wall 
of the corridor to access the Secret area #12 with the two bottles of absinthe. You 
can get the credit for finding this secret this way, and you may enter the Sabrine 
MK3's corridor by activating the pushwall mentioned at Secret area #12.


Level 4: Under the soil
=======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 9

Secret #1:

Near the start, there is a small niche in the gray stone wall. Push the bottom wall 
and find a small nook with four piles of 9mm.

Secret #2:

At the north, there is a fenced area with Drones and there are two stems of wormwood 
near the earth wall (there were a lot of exploding oil drums which I assume you figured 
out soon enough). You used a narrow tunnel to enter this area, right? Go back to 
the narrow tunnel, and open the wooden braced wall to find an abandoned cellar with 
four bottles of fine absinthe.

Secret #3:

Once you have entered the earth tunnels, you will soon come across a warren, whose 
wall is made of black bricks in an L-shape. Go to the corner, and push the north 
wall to reveal a hidden tunnel leading to a fissure gate. This particular fissure 
gate will transfer you to the brick room blocked by spear traps. Inside, you can 
have the Artefacts of Salvation and Invulnerability. Plus, you can access some of 
the later secrets from here as well.

Secret #4:

One of the earth tunnels may lead you to a dead end with black brickwall, and there 
is mugwort. You'll just have to suffer this - pick up the mugwort, and push the brickwall 
to gain access into the sewer. You can collect a 9mm clip, 9mm bullets and some 12,6mm 
bullets here.

Secret #5:

You must have found Secret area #4 to access this secret.
Stay in the sewer, and look around a bit. There is a secret door on the left wall, 
exactly opposite where the 9mm bullets were. Open it, but be cautious - a Drone is 
inside at a fenced-off area. You will see more sewer tunnels, a bottle of absinthe, 
a vial of holy water, some rocket grenade, and a whole bunch of jewels at a cave. 
You will also notice wooden braced walls and a fenced-off area beyond.

Secret #6:

You must have found Secret area #5 to access this secret.
After you've snatched all the treasure, push the leftmost wooden braced wall, and 
you can wander deeper into the cave. Take extra care however, there are many Drones 
here, plus Acolytes may be shooting from the corridor as well. There are 5 crowns 
hidden among the rocks of the cave here, plus a Blood key, and an Artefact of Life. 


Secret #7:

Proceed to the underground chamber with the two spear traps, where the tunnel turns 
into a cave. Go to the bottom right corner of this chamber, and press the wooden 
braced wall here. This way, you can enter the small fenced-off passageway with the 
Drone I told you about earlier. A Sabrine MK3 and a box of 12,6mm ammunition is here.


Secret #8:

This secret area can be seen at the end of the level, but you can only access it 
from the Bronze key's area. Once you have grabbed the Bronze key, exit the narrow 
tunnel, and head to the north. You will see a narrow tunnel leading deep into a cave. 
A portion of the right wall has wooden beam support. One of these walls can be pushed 
in, letting you inside a sealed cave with some Drones, treasure, and a backpack full 
of ammo!

Secret #9: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #3 and Secret area #6 to access this secret.
Remember the small brick chamber which had the two Artefacts? Get back there, and 
push the wall beside the left lantern. A narrow hidden tunnel you shall see, sealed 
with a locked Blood door. Use the Blood key to open this, thus, you can enter the 
final secret area you can see from outside the grates. Now, you can collect all the 
wonderful things you see - two Artefacts of Life, crucifixes and crowns, another 
backpack of ammunition, 12,6mm ammo box, and a SmartGun!


Level 5: Aqueduct
=================

TOTAL SECRETS: 15

Secret #1:

When you reach the locked Bronze door, walk to the black brickwall opposite this 
door. Take a few steps back, then check the wall - there should be a secret door 
opening to a small cave, which has two boxes of jewels and bags of gold.

Secret #2:

Not far from the previous secret. Follow this wall towards the direction of the level 
start, NOT the water reservoir chamber! Turn at 90 degrees, so the wall should be 
on your left side. Not far from this turning point, start checking the left walls 
to find another buried cave with crucifixes and bags of gold.

Secret #3:

This one is hard to find. You must look for a narrow, T-shaped sewer tunnel with 
a vial of holy water, and a puddle of water, and the bottom of these tunnels are 
sealed with rusty steel plate. From the left of this tunnel, there is a secret door 
opening to a hidden sewer tunnel. You can pick up an Artefact of Life inside.

Secret #4:

You can easily find this one. First, get to the abandoned part of the aqueduct with 
tiny gray brickwalled chamber. There are  quite a few Drones here, you can't miss 
it. The wall which has the dead window will open for you, letting you inside an even 
more abandoned sewer tunnel. Even if this tunnel was not used for the past 50 or 
so years, a few things still remained here. A bag of gold, two jewellery boxes, 9mm 
and 12,6mm ammo, some wormwood, rocket grenades, and a bronze key too! It seems like 
that this tunnel eventually leads to the great outdoors, so hiding it from prying 
eyes makes sense.

Secret #5:

Head back to the underground chamber where you have found Secret area #4. Stand in 
front of the abandoned aqueduct tunnel, you will see that the left corner of the 
wall is nothing more than a pile of rocks. Immediately start checking the walls which 
are left from the corner, one of them is a secret door. A cavern is behind with stems 
of wormwood, a mugwort, and an Artefact of Life!

Secret #6:

Locate the treasure cavern with the Drones next to the abandoned aqueduct, there 
should be a black brickwall. Open the wall in the corner to find a hidden area with 
a bazooka, some rocket grenades, and and a bottle of fine absinthe.

Secret #7:

You must have found Secret area #6 to access this secret.
This one does not count as a secret, but it is a short-cut straight to the end of 
the level. You will notice a pile of rubble near the gray stone wall of Secret area 
#6. Push it - you will be right at the exit room.

Secret #8:

Inside the pumping station, behind the locked Bronze door. Walk to the area where 
you obtained a Sabrine MK3. Push the right wall at the small nook where the gun was, 
you'll find a hidden hole with 3 crowns.

Secret #9:

Get to the south aqueduct area, where the tunnels are narrow, and there are Suicide 
drones and spear traps in some of the tunnels. Eventually these tunnels will lead 
to a dead end sealed with steel plating. Push the steel plating to reveal yet another 
hidden cavern with lots of treasure. Watch out for interfering Suicide drones though.


Secret #10:

You will need to get to a certain part of the aqueduct - there is a tunnel blocked 
by two spear traps, and nearby, there are two dead ends in the aqueduct, one of them 
also has a spear trap at the end. Next to this dead end, there is another dead end 
(presumably on your left) with a puddle of water and some vines. Push the backwall 
of the dead end to find a hidden area with 2 bags of gold, 12,6mm bullets, a 9mm 
clip, and a chalice.

Secret #11:

You must have found Secret area #10 to access this secret.
Walk to the upper area of Secret area #10, where you found the golden chalice, and 
try the right wall, opposite to the chalice. There should be a hidden nook with two 
boxes of 12,6mm.

Secret #12:

You must have found Secret area #11 to access this secret.
More secrets await you here! Explore the bottom left wall of Secret area #11 to open 
up an identical hidden nook with two bottles of absinthe.

Secret #13:

You must have found Secret area #12 to access this secret.
Open the left walls inside the hidden nook of Secret #12. You will find a pushwall, 
letting you inside a sealed sewer tunnel with a stealth rifle and some 14mm ammunition.


Secret #14:

You must have found Secret area #13 to access this secret.
Not bad, huh? How about some more? Check the brick wall in the corner, exactly opposite 
the stealth rifle. Believe it or not, there is a narrow hidden area with four crowns 
and a backpack there!

Secret #15: (Super secret area)

You must have found  Secret area #14 to access this secret.
Ever wanted to enter the sealed underground chamber with the Artefacts and the treasure 
behind the grates, and the spear traps! Now is your big chance! Just experiment with 
the right walls in Secret area #14, you'll find the hidden area sooner than you might 
think! Inside, you can have the Artefact of Life, two Artefacts of Invulnerability, 
a lot of treasure, a SmartGun, rockets and 14mm ammunition as well!

and a 9mm clip.

so you can explore the back of the storage, which was blocked by this crate. You 
can find 12,6mm ammunition here, and two bottles of fine absinthe.

Secret #4:

This one is hidden in the wall of the dungeon hallway, and it's pretty hard to find. 
From the triple door entrance, head to the right until you see a puddle of water 
on the floor. Go to the wall corner opposite this puddle of water, the pushwall is 
right at the corner. A small hidden compartment with a Sabrine MK3 and three piles 
of 12,6mm.

Secret #5:

You must have found Secret area #2 to access this secret.
Continue walking down the dungeon hallway to the prison cells. Some of them has Drones

the stonewall is opened at the last cell, there is an Artefact of Invulnerability 
inside.

A lot of various ammunition can be picked up here.

Secret #8: 

You must have found Secret area #7 to acccess this secret.
During the struggle with the Gold key, you saw several cells, some of them had Drones 
inside, and supplies. We're going to enter these cells now.
Stay here at the outer corridor. You shall notice that the left wall belongs to the 
dungeon, whilst the right wall is made of black bricks. We are going to open a few 
secret doors now. Let's start from the locked Bronze door. Lean against the dungeon's 
stone wall while constantly checking for secret doors. The first secret door is a 
few meters away from the Bronze door, letting you inside the first cell with the

steel door, and the walls are made of gray stone here. Looks like you're off the 
Room of 4 Keys' area. Explore this small building, you will see a switch on the wall. 
Pull it - this will open the super secret area for you.

Secret #11:

Return to the dungeon hallway. At the end, there will be a Tasoth, guarding two brown 
stoned doorways. Kill him. Then walk to the corner, near the cell door on the left. 
Push the wall in the corner, this will reveal a hidden hallway with more cells, and 
coffins. You can pick up Lord suppers here.

Secret #12:

You must have found Secret area #11 to access this secret.
Opposite the second prison cell's window. Push that portion of wall to enter the 
first cell you probably saw from the hallway - here is an Artefact of Invulnerability 
for you.

Secret #13:

Jump among the flames in the torture chamber, and push the backwall. Do not fear 
for your health - the  secret area behind the furnace has an Artefact of Life!

Secret #14: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #10 to access this secret.
Proceed to the second tunnels junction, with the black brick monolith on the center 
(there is the passage which you have opened by pulling the switch in the torture 
chamber). If you have activated that second switch in the Secret area #10 building, 
you will witness that a new tunnel have opened on the south. This looks like an abandoned 
tunnel - the left branch is washed out, but the right one leads you to a secret elevator 
to secret level 2 (Wormhole). You still need to find the elevator key though.

Secret #15:

The graystone chamber with the Black Apostle and the two spear traps. Exit this chamber, 
and look on the left. There is a portion of the wall in the corner. Give it a push 
from the side, it will slide away, revealing a hidden rusty door. There are two Artefacts 
of Salvation inside.

Secret #16:

Exactly next to the rusty steel door leading you to the Bronze key. Push the brickwall 
here to find a hidden, narrow corridor with an Artefact of Life.

Secret #17:

You will need to be at the brown stone area of the Room of 4 keys. Search for a room, 
which has several narrow side passages, with neonlight on each projection's end. 
You can collect holy water and some ammo here. Look for a wall, whose neonlight is 
not functioning, and push it. There is a small treasure chamber with 6 crowns behind.


Secret #18:

Go inside the guard house of the brown stone area, look for a stained glass window. 
Open it - behind there are two small nooks with two crucifixes.


Level 9: Execution area
=======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 13


Secret #1:

Near the start, a wide hallway leads inside, its wall is made of those tiny cellar-bricks. 
Each corner of this hallway has a wooden torch, except the first one. Experiment 
with the walls in this corner, and you will find a hidden catacomb with holy water, 
and some treasure.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Stay here in this catacomb, and look for a dead window on the right. This is the 
secret door. Behind, a small warren lies with more treasure!

Secret #3:

Enter the dungeon through the locked Blood doors, there shall be a lot of Acolytes 
and a Black Apostle here. Kill them, and take a look around in the dungeon. Look 
for a portion of a wall which does not have a cell window on it. Go to the central 
portion of this certain wall and open it. There is a prison cell behind, where you 
can get Lord's supper, and a few pieces of gold. And the most important - an Artefact 
of Salvation.

Secret #4:

You must have found Secret area #3 to access this secret.
Move behind the pushed portion of the wall here in Secret #3's prison cell. Open 
that part of the backwall as well, so you can get inside the Drones' lair you saw 
from the fissure gates, and collect their dropped ammunition.

Secret #5:

You shall need a Bronze key for this one. Walk to the brown stone dungeon, towards 
the double locked Bronze doors, with the cross between them. Enter the left holding 
cell - the secret door is the wall exactly opposite the door. A small nook is behind 
with an Artefact of Life.

Secret #6:

This one also requires a Bronze key. Return to the dungeon's locked entrance, where 
the cross symbol is, but this time, step inside the right cell. There is a Drone 
inside, watch out. You will notice a small niche with a puddle of water, this marks 
the secret door. Open the wall, and discover a hidden escape tunnel with various 
treasure items, it ends at a black brickwall.

Secret #7:

You must have found Secret area #6 to access this secret.
Once you cleaned out the Secret #6 tunnel, walk to the corner of the black brickwall, 
and activate the secret door here, on your left. This way, you will gain access to 
the area sealed away with grates. There are 4 Drones here, make sure you will be 
prepared for them. Apart from their dropped ammo, you may collect 12,6mm ammunition, 
a few pieces of precious gold, a bottle of fine absinthe, and a Stealth rifle here.


Secret #8:

Inside the crematory with the Gold key. The third furnace's back wall is a secret 
door. Behind the furnace, you will find another Artefact of Life.

Secret #9:

Exactly next to the left entrance of the incineration tunnel. Push the wall next 
to the rusty door to find a hidden area with an Artefact of Invulnerability, and 
a switch that can turn off the fireball launcher. Very useful to get rid of the Superdrone!


Secret #10:

The sealed exit of the dungeon area, where the two Tasoths are. Yes, they are positively 
guarding something. The secret door is on the left, right before the passage gets 
narrow at the doors. A small nook has a backpack and two rocket grenades here.

Secret #11:

This secret area has two entrances, and is found at the L-shaped stone hallway. The 
first entrance is found almost opposite the second wooden door. The second entrance 
is beyond the corner, almost exactly opposite the torch after the second room. Both 
will lead you to a small treasure chamber, where you can collect gold, and reload 
your lost soul strength at an Artefact of Regeneration!

Secret #12:

It is hidden in the fourth room on the stone hallway, almost next to the gramophone. 
A hidden area with 4 bottles of fine absinthe!

Secret #13:

The last room of the stone hallway. The secret door is left from the door, in the 
room's corner. When you open it, you will immediately see a rusty steel door. Through 
this door, you can access the treasure chamber seen from the exit hall. You can grab 
all the precious gold, plus you can easily dispatch the Suicide drones from behind 
the safety of the grate.


Level 10: Monastery
===================

TOTAL SECRETS: 10


Secret #1:

Found at the second junction of the monastery hallway, just opposite the banner next 
to the Blood door, in the niche of the wall. Behind the brickwall, a small armory 
lies with a bunch of 9mm and 12,6mm bullets, and a machinegun.

Secret #2:

The rightmost cubicle of the toilet, which is unoccupied. Push the right tilewall, 
and enter the hole. Then push the left wall to arrive to a secret bathroom with an 
Artefact of Fury, and 3 bottles of absinthe. If one push is not enough, then push 
the wall again. 

Secret #3:

You must have found Secret area #3 to access this secret.
Press the wall next to the toilet in Secret area #2 to reveal a hidden room which 
is currently under construction. In fact, it is an armory, and there are LOTS of 
ammunition here for all your weapons. You can also pick up a Sabrine MK3 and a bazooka 
here too!

Secret #4: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #3 and Secret area #8 to access this secret.
To find this hidden area, go back to the construction zone of Secret area #3. You 
will see that one portion of the wall has been removed, and a gray stoned narrow 
corridor lies behind. Carefully enter the corridor, you will arrive to an outer hallway 
of the falanster, with windows and more narrow passages. One of them has an Artefact 
of Life, but I suggest you spare this one till the end. Eventually, you will arrive 
to a rusty steel door. Open with caution - a Drone and a Black Apostle is patrolling 
on the hallway behind! Once you have killed them, it would be wise to collect the 
Artefact you saw earlier. At the end of the hallway, there is a secret exit, which 
takes you to secret level 3 - Sssssh! You still need a gate key to pass though.

Secret #5:

To access the right gallery of the monastery with the Artifact of Life and the elevator 
key, you must enter the last room in the second junction just before the locked Blood 
door. The room is on the right, and luckily, it's empty. The secret door is next 
to the bed. I suggest you collect some absinthe before entering the gallery - the 
badfellas from all over the monastery will attack you from both directions, there 
are at least 20 of them. SmartGun is also highly recommended. Once you clean up the 
area, you can grab the Artefact and the gate key, which unlocks the secret exit.


Secret #6:

The upper hallway with the Tasoths. There is a small side chamber with a sink. Press 
the wall which is almost next to the puddle of water. It will open to a narrow corridor 
which ends at the three Tasoths. If you're quick, you can run into the small nook 
at the end, where you can grab a bazooka, a glass of absinthe, and a backpack.

Secret #7:

Not far from the Tasoths just opposite the second Blood door, there should be a small 
niche with two 9mm bullet piles on the floor. To find the secret door, you will need 
to push the wall which is next to the left pile of bullets. Watch out however, when 
you enter - you will be at the brown stoned cylinder of the small area where the 
Gold key is. This area is filled with Drones and Suicide drones, plus there are Tasoths 
at the end. You can collect 2 glasses of fine absinthe, and treasures from next to 
the torches. Kill the Tasoths, since there is a second secret door there...

Secret #8:

You must have found Secret area #7 to access this secret.
Go to the corridor of Secret #7, where the two Tasotsh were. Turn to the north, and 
start checking the brown stone walls on your right. A hidden room lies somewhere 
behind with a lever. Pull this - it will open the super secret area.

Secret #9:

Open the stained glass in the monastery behind the Bronze key to access the two galleries 
with the church organs. Both gallery holds two crucifixes and a glass of absinthe, 
if the Acolytes did not drink it already.

Secret #10:

The U-shaped hallway outside the Blood key. This area has many enemies, namely Acolytes 
and Black Apostles. There is a machinegun with two 9mm clips here as well. Now then...walk 
to the left entrance, right opposite the locked gate. You shall see a banner on the 
wall. Push this wall portion, there is a treasure room behind with mostly crucifixes. 
You will also see a wooden door blocked with a barricade. Remember this location 
- it will be critical later in the game...


Level 11: The Cathedral
=======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 8


Secret #1: 

Found at the narrow tunnels - the one with the Drone. At the end of this tunnel, 
there is a pile of bones. Push the end of the tunnel to reveal a hidden portion with 
lots of 12,6mm ammunition.

Secret #2:

Still here at the narrow tunnels quarter. Near the exit, there is a dead end with 
a pile of 12,6mm bullets. Press the stone wall here as well, and you will find a 
hidden corridor, where a bazooka and some rockets are.

Secret #3:

This is quite tricky to find. You need to find the lower hallway with the green marble 
walls. The right side of this hallway has niches with burning torches. The secret 
door is in one of these niches between the two torches (it is the third niche). Open 
the secret door, and enter. There is a hidden hallway with lots of valuable treasures. 
You will not get these without a fight - a Black Apostle is inside!

Secret #4:

This one is pretty easy to find - you must be at the junction, where the right hallway 
passes through brick arches towards the confession cabin. Just before walking down 
the diagonal part of the hallway, you will see a floral ornament on the wall. This 
is the secret door - and it leads to the right choir of the upper nave. You can find 
a bag of gold, jewels, and some absinthe here. Be aware that the nave is filled with 
Courbée Dominate initiates.

Secret #5:

This one is harder to locate, you will really have to know what you are looking for. 
First, go to the junction with the pentagram, and turn to the left towards the library 
(there is a Tasoth). Now, when you're facing the supposedly killed Tasoth, lean against 
the left walls, and tap the red marble walls here. You will know it when you will 
find it. Behind there is a narrow corridor, and a wooden door. The corridor leads 
to the sealed away common area with the Acolytes and the Priestess. Behind the wooden 
door, there is a badly needed Artifact of Fury, and a white coloumn.

Secret #6:

Right here at the Artefact of Fury. Although this one doesn't count as a secret, 
it will make your Fury Artefact a LOT more effective. Quickly break down the coloumn, 
and push the wall behind. You will arrive to the library, right to the back of many 
Black Apostles! Quickly grab the Invulnearability Artefact, and now, stab everyone 
to death!

Secret #7:

North from the pentagram junction, behind the wooden door on the right. It will lead 
you to the balustrade of the choir, and seems to be a dead end. But it's not. You'll 
need to break down the coloumn, and push the wall behind to access the left choir, 
and the musician's gallery. The choir has Lord suppers and a spare Gold key, the 
gallery has mainly 12,6mm bullets and a 14mm clip too.

Secret #8:

In the presbytery's dressing room with an Acolyte and a Priestess. There are two 
coat hangers and two candles here. The wall next to the left coat hanger is a pushwall. 
A small hidden area contains four 9mm clips and some spilled 9mm bullets.


Level 12: The Necropolis
========================

TOTAL SECRETS: 16


Secret #1:

Not far from your entry tunnelways. Turn to the left, and start counting the white 
pillars at the green marble wall. Knock down the third one, and push the wall behind 
to reveal a hidden burial chamber with bags of gold, and jewels.

Secret #2:

This secret area has two entrances - one from the westmost hallway where the two 
coffins are, and there are some 9mm and 12,6mm bullets behind. The secret door is 
opposite the second coffin and a window. The second entrance is where you can find 
the Bronze key, and on the right, there is a fire, and a banner on the wall - this 
is the secret door. This hidden area is an escapeway in case the Unstoppables get 
you cornered. Inside you can find two bottles of fine absinthe, and two boxes of 
12,6mm ammunition. You can open each secret door from the inside as well - the banner 
on the brickwall, and the brickwall opposite the brickwall between the two wooden 
panelling with the holy crosses.

Secret #3:

Near the Blood key, there is a short hallway which leads to the eastmost hallways 
with the coffins. There are four white pillars at this hallway, so you can identify 
the place pretty easily. Look for a lantern on the ceiling, and facing the window 
archways, push the bare brickwall that is right hand direction from the lantern! 
You shall discover a narrow corridor leading to a bottle of absinthe and a 9mm clip 
(this can be seen from the first right junction behind the balustrades).
Take into account, however, that this secret area has only one exit. The Unstoppables 
can't enter, but if you get caught here, you're doomed.

Secret #4:

You must have found Secret area #3 to access this secret.
The narrow corridor of Secret #3 ends at the 9mm clip. Push the bottom brickwall 
behind the 9mm clip and you will find the hidden route to the Artefact of Life, which 
you have seen from outside the hallway behind the balustrade.

Secret #5:

You must have found Secret area #4 to access this secret.
Here in this hidden area with the Artefact of Life, push the wall with the banner 
on it to find a hidden nook with a SmartGun! This should help you with those Unstoppables.


Secret #6:

This secret area also has two entrances. One is beside the knight armour where you 
can grab the Blood key. The second entrance is at the north passage with the locked 
Bronze doors, almost opposite a black coloumn (there are two 12,6mm boxes nearby). 
Either way, you will find a red-stoned vault with chalices and jewels. Through this 
secret area, you can escape the dead end with the Blood key. Both pushwalls can be 
moved from the inside as well, try the bare brickwalls at the two corners opposite 
the red stonewalls.

Secret #7:

The upper corner of the westmost hallway. There should be a stained glass decoration 
near a couple of coffins and two glasses of absinthe. This secret area is an unique 
"double-secret" - you can push the stained glass from two directions - the Lord supper 
and the rockets. If you push it from the direction of the rockets, you shall locate 
a hidden ammunition depot with a backpack, a 14mm clip, some more rockets, 9mm and 
12,6mm bullets.  

Secret #8:

The same secret with Secret #7. If you need soul restoring items rather than ammunition, 
push the stained glass wall from the direction of the Lord's supper. You will find 
a small hidden room, where two bottles of absinthe, two glasses of absinthe, and 
a Lord'supper await you. You shall get the same credit for both secrets, regardless 
which one you choose.

Secret #9:

The green marble hallway with the coffins and flames at both end. Go to the left, 
and push the green marble wall behind the burning fire on the right! It might hurt 
a bit, but then, you will find a treasure vault with various gold and a view to another 
secret in this level.

Secret #10:

Opposite Secret area #9, at the other end of the hallway. You should see two statues 
behind the burning fire. Clench your teeth and jump into the flames to move the wall 
with the statue away. You shall enter an identical secret area to #9, but this time, 
there are some ammunition and armaments here - a bazooka, a Sabrine MK3, some 12,6mm 
bullets and rockets, too. There is another glimpse of a later secret of this level.


Secret #11:

It would be wise to skip these secrets until you've defeated the Unstoppables, or 
else they will corner you here. If you are really low on health or you are playing 
on Top Ace difficulty level, you might encourage opening this and the next secret 
right after the Unstoppables start looking for you - but be extremely quick. If you 
get caught in this chamber, you are as good as dead.
Next to the dais with the elevator key, you shall see two knight armours embraced 
by flames. Rush to the wall near the flames and push it. You will find a hidden chamber 
with four crowns and an Artefact of Salvation.

Secret #12:

Identical to Secret area #11. Run to the right wall where the fire is burning and 
push the wall near the fire. You can collect the same treasure and Artefact here. 


Secret #13:

You must have found Secret area #11 to access this secret.
In the left hidden chamber with the crowns & the artifact, you should see a burning 
torch, almost oppsite the secret entrance. Explore the walls near the burning torch, 
there is a secret pushwall in a corner, near the torch. If you go inside, you will 
find a hidden hallway of the Necropolis. At the end, there is a switch, which shall 
open another hidden area on the level. 


Secret #14:

You must have found Secret area #12 to access this secret.
This secret area is identical to Secret area #13, except it opens from the right 
hidden chamber of crowns & artifact. Again, you will find a switch here, that will 
open the route to the secret exit.


Secret #15:

You must have found Secret area #14 to access this secret.
Return to the starting hallway with the green marble walls. Head towards the southeast 
with the stained glass decoration and the skulls on stakes (you could grab two bottles 
of absinthe here). If you have activated the lever, you could discover that the stained 
glass is moved away, revealing two doors. Behind the doors, there is a hidden hallway 
with a room at the end, hiding the Gold key.

Secret #16:

You must have found Secret area #13 to access this secret.
To find the hidden exit on this level, you must activate the switch at Secret area 
#13. Stroll back to the initial hallway with the tunnelways that lead you here. Go 
to the L shaped turning point at the southwest. 



Level 13: Abbatoire
===================

TOTAL SECRETS: 8


Secret #1:

Right at the start, next to your elevator. The second elevator is seemingly empty, 
but you can open the lift control panel to access the shaft. Here in the shaft,  
you may collect a fair amount of 9mm and 12,6mm bullets, and two rocket grenades. 
You will get the credit for the secret once you go for the 9mm ammunition.

Secret #2:

At the small brown brick cylinder, which leads to the fissure gate. Enter here through 
the right door, you will see a burning torch near the door, on your left. Just a 
few steps away from the torch, start checking the left walls. A portion of the wall 
can be opened here to find a small area with two bags of gold, two rocket grenades, 
and four jewellery boxes behind breakable coloumns.

Secret #3:

The third secret of this level is also found at the brown brick cylinder, near the 
fissure gate. At the fissure gate's left side, you will see a banner on the wall. 
Open this piece of wall to find a hidden treasure corridor with six bags of gold, 
and a Blood key. You better watch out, as two Suicide Drones are protecting the treasure!!!

You may also access this secret area through Secret area #6 teleporting, and still 
get the credit for the secret.

Secret #4:

At the passage leading out the living quarters' corridor. There is a sealed door 
nearby with two torches, and a vial of holy water. The secret door is just behind 
the holy water; four chalices and a jewellery box in a small hole.

Secret #5:

This one does not count as a secret, but grants you an Artefact of Invulnerability. 
Between the cage of the Ultradrone and the Unstoppable, there is a narrow nook. You 
can open it by pushing the bottom of the nook. This way you'll let the bad folks 
out, but it also means you can use your bazooka on them.

Secret #6:

It might be pretty hard to find. You will need to be at the area with the locked 
Bronze cabinets and the locked Blood cabinet. A hallway made of gray stone is leading 
to the west. The left wall has some niches in it. Go to the section which is BETWEEN 
the niches, and press the central portion of the wall here. If you did it right, 
you will find yourself in a hidden side chamber with 4 boxes of jewels and a fissure 
gate. The jewels are behind a puddle of sludge, you'll just have to suffer it, if 
you don't have invulnerability. The fissure gate teleports you to Secret area #3, 
you can exit via the bannered wall.

Secret #7: 

Before exploring this secret, it would be a fine idea to turn the fireball launchers 
off, at least the bottom one. Proceed to the corridor which is guarded by this particular 
fireball launcher. At the wall, you shall witness two piles of bones. The secret 
door is the wall right among these piles of bones. A tiny hidden area with two 9mm 
clips.

Secret #8:

It is at the green marbled wall chamber with the 3 narrow passageways. At the bottom 
of this chamber, there is a lone crucifix in a nook. Push the bottom wall of this 
nook to discover a hidden area with three crowns.


Level 14: Compound
==================

TOTAL SECRETS: 7


Secret #1:

Right at the start. Before you get out of the small court, inspect the gray stone 
wall that is on your left JUST BEFORE the bottleneck narrowing. You will find a narrow 
pathway with a PCV and a bottle of absinthe. Well...better than nothing.

Secret #2:

At the first courtyard with the gray brick monolith with the Tasoths, and the Drones. 
There is heavy resistance here, you'll need to fight hard. Once you're inside, stick 
to the right wall, and look for a gothic street lamp. There should be a pile of 9mm 
bullets on the ground. The wall after this particular bullets pile is a hidden pushwall, 
it shall give you access outside the building near the hedge. Two bottles of absinthe, 
three stems of wormwood, and 4 crucifixes are here for you!

Secret #3:

Near the courtyard with the Artefact of Regeneration, there is a rusty door which 
opens to a balcony that takes you to the fissure gate. There is an Unstoppable guarding 
the door, a bag of gold and some jewels. You are going to see two wooden torches 
next to the wall, where the path gets a little wider. Check the wall just after the 
first torch from the door, this is how you can grab the Artefact of Life seen from 
the atrium.

Secret #4:

This one is also found at this circular balcony, at the lower part (there were many 
Acolytes and Black Apostles here). You will see a few niches on the wall here, one 
of them has a lone bag of gold. The portion of the wall just after this bag of gold 
is the secret door. This is the first wall portion where the balcony gets narrow 
again. Press the wall from the direction of the balcony to reveal a hidden area with 
a box of 12,6mm and some more 12,6mm bullets scattered around.

Secret #5:

You must have found Secret area #4 to access this secret.
In the hidden area of Secret #4, you ought to press the wall just behind the 12,6mm 
box to reveal a narrow corridor. You are going to need to activate the pushwall one 
or two more times until it promptly stucks. Then, start searching for pushwalls on 
your left! If you did good, you shall be out in the wilderness surrounding the falanster. 
You can collect several wormwood here. Above all this, a narrow pathway, which takes 
you to the back of the building will also hold 2 Artefacts of Salvation, and a few 
pieces of gold for you to nab.

Secret #6:

You are going to push multiple walls here once again. The building, opposite the 
black brick warehouse with the Unstoppable and the elevator key. The gray stone building 
has two windows next to each other, a streetlamp, and wormwood is growing nearby. 
Look for the secret door right after the wormwood. It will open into a seemingly 
empty hole. Start pushing the bottom wall of the hole, until it lets you in a small 
garden. Some wormwood is growing here, and you can exit the falanster into the great 
outdoors. Somewhere in the woods, an Artefact of Life awaits!

Secret #7:

The last secret is at the green marble fissure gate chamber. The bottom wall behind 
the fissure gate has a secret door on the left. Behind, you will see a tiny hole 
with a bag of gold and a backpack full of ammo!


Level 15: Falanster
===================

TOTAL SECRETS: 8


Secret #1:

This one is rather easy. Towards the north hallway leading to the two wooden doors, 
there is a sealed armory on the right, with a Suomi machinegun, two 9mm bullet piles 
and a 9mm clip. You shall need to push the right wall in the corner to enter here.


Secret #2:

This one is trickier. Locate the X-shaped junction, preferably, from the bottom door. 
There is an ammunition stash hidden at the south part of the X, there are not just 
one, but two pushwalls that can take you there. Look for them at the third portion 
of the diagonal wall from the bottom (doesn't matter which route you access the X-shaped 
junction; the fissure gate chamber or the south hallway). Inside, you will see a 
narrow corridor, which leads to a small armory, where you can grab ammunition for 
all your armaments, and an Artefact of Salvation, too.

Secret #3:

While this secret is not so well hidden, it may take ages for someone to actually 
find it, because it is a location, where nobody would expect it. So then, you will 
need to stay here at the X-shaped junction. Head to the stained glass at the center, 
and turn to the north (your back is towards the south hallway with the two Priestesses, 
and Secret area #2). You will need to push away the top portion on the LEFT triangle. 
You ought to find a wooden door there - it leads to a hidden treasure room with lots 
of gold, and more importantly - an Artefact of Invulnerability and Fury! With the 
help of these, you can easily kill everyone inside the nave!

Secret #4:

The left wing of the nave, with the two Tasoths, two candlestands and two chalices. 
There is the spear trap nearby. Got the location? Now, step to the red curtain right 
to the candlestand, and push the red marble wall - a small hidden compartment holds 
a stealth rifle and some 14mm ammo for it.

Secret #5:

You can ONLY access this secret, if you can trick the Acolytes behind the windows 
to open the locked Blood door for you, as there is no Blood key in this level. 
Head to the hallway with the lever and black pillars, and stand next to the Blood 
door. If you were clever, and spared an Acolyte when wreaking havoc on the Courb	
e Dominate flunkies behind the windows, he should open the Blood door and attack 
you. Kill the Acolyte exactly between the frames, so the door will stay opened. This 
is imperative - otherwise you will not be able to get out of here. 
This is not really the secret, but still, you can collect some 9mm ammunition from 
the carcasses, and some edibles as well. At the end of this corridor, you will notice 
an eye symbol on the wall. Push it, and it will slide in, letting you into the last 
firing point, where you can get the killed Acolyte's 9mm bullets.

Secret #6:

You must have found Secret area #5 to access this secret.
I assume you have figured out that lousy 4 bullets doesn't really worth so much suffering. 
There MUST be something else. Exactly. Something else is hidden here. Push the eye 
symbol wall again, and then, again, until you arrive to a narrow passage on the right. 
A lone torch is here, surrounded by 3 bottles of fine absinthe. There is also a lever, 
which shall open Secret area #7.

Secret #7:

You must have found Secret area #6 to access this secret.
And that's not all, you must also survive the cathedral's nave somehow! Make your 
way to the hallway leading to the locked Gold doors and the exit tunnel. If you have 
activated that certain lever, you will see that the stained glass ornament on the 
wall has moved away. There is a hidden hallway behind - at the top, you can pick 
up six crowns, an Artefact of Life and an Artefact of Salvation. At the bottom, there 
is a secret elevator, taking you to secret level 4 - Goodbye Kitty! Be sure that 
you have high health when stepping inside the elevator...the door is boobytrapped!!!


Secret #8:

The final secret at this level is found at the destination of the fissure gate - 
to the right, there is a pair of locked Gold doors leading to the exit. Now then, 
look the walls carefully, you will see two eye ornaments. The secret pushwall is 
the right eye symbol. This way, you can enter the fourth, sealed area of the divided 
chamber. Two Artefacts of Salvation awaits you at the torch, with a holy water, and 
there is also a Sabrine MK3 with some 12,6mm bullets at the wall. The fissure gate 
here teleports you back to the elevator.


Level 16: Fortification
=======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 10


Secret #1:

At the bottom of the dining area with the bottle of absinthe between two white marble 
dining tables, push the green wall to reveal a small treasure chamber with bags of 
gold, and chalices.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Push the wall in Secret area #1 that is directly behind the wall portion you just 
moved. You will be at an identical small treasure chamber with chalices and jewels.


Secret #3:

You must have found Secret area #1 and Secret area #2 to access this secret.
After you have collected all the gold from Secret area #2, try the wall that is exactly 
behind the portion you moved away a few seconds ago! A hidden hallway shall be revealed. 
To the right, there is a dead end with two crucifixes under the windows and two bottles 
of tasty absinthe. To the left, you will see a foyer with 4 crowns, an Artefact of 
Salvation, and a couple of locked Bronze doors. 

Secret #4: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #3 and Secret area #6 to access this secret.
How to get behind those locked Bronze doors? Don't bother looking for a Bronze key, 
there aren't any. But what did you see when peeking through those windows earlier? 
A Black Apostle? I hope you did not kill him as you saw him...you will need his kind 
help to open the locked door and let you inside. This time, it's not so critical 
to kill him right at the door frame, as you can exit the super secret area via fissure 
gate. Just make sure you get inside. If you fail, there shall not be a second chance, 
it might be a good idea to save your game here. The super secret area here is stuffed 
with various treasure, two Artefacts of Life, and an Invulnerability Artefact as 
well. The fissure gate shall teleport you right inside the fortification, saving 
you a LOT of trouble!

Secret #5:

Remember the room with the Invulnerability Artefact which is mined? You don't need 
to suffer for it - there is an alternate way to obtain it. Near the junction with 
the flag, where the Priestesses were fighting you. Walk to the right hallway, right 
to the wall, and check the red marble here. A secret door will be opened. Follow 
the narrow corridor to a vial of holy water, and a pillar. Knock the pillar down, 
and push the wall at the right. You will be at the Artefact of Invulnerability.

Secret #6:

Get past the first barricade to the fireball hallway. Quickly run past the fireball 
stream, and (carefully) walk to the corner. Here, push the hallway's wall. You will 
open a small area with a wooden door. The door leads to a small storage area with 
a Stealth rifle and two vials of holy water. When picking up the Stealth rifle, a 
Black Apostle will spot you from behind the window, and charge at you. Make sure 
you DO NOT kill him, or you will never get behind the Bronze doors of Secret area 
#3 - he is your "key" for the super secret area.

Secret #7:

Inside the fortification, in the room where the fissure gate takes you. Walk to the 
wall where you see a writing desk. Now, open the wall that is RIGHT from the desk, 
in the corner! A hidden control room you will see, with a few 9mm bullets, a bottle 
of absinthe, a glass of absinthe, and two switches - these will turn the fireball 
launchers off.

Secret #8:

The brown brick hallway inside the fortification. Push the brickwall portion that 
is exactly opposite the window! You will find a small room with a switch, that opens 
Secret area #9 for you.

Secret #9:

The armory of the fortification, behind the second and third barricade. Getting inside 
is tricky - the entrance is trapped. But if you have found Secret area #8 and pulled 
the lever, the other side of the brickwall has opened, and you can grab all the ammunition 
inside along with the backpack you will find. 
You can also enter through the door, if you have invulnerability, you will still 
get the credit for the secret.

Secret #10:

The fireball shield of the second fireball launcher. You're going to need to turn 
the fireball launcher off, otherwise, you will not survive. When the fireball launcher 
is off, walk into the small nook with the red stone wall and push it. A hidden storage 
room is there, with boxes of 12,6mm, three clips of 9mm, an Artefact of Life and 
an Artefact of Salvation. You will also find a spare Elevator key just in case you 
failed to get the other one from the traps.


Level 17: Ballroom Tango
========================

TOTAL SECRETS: 10


Secret #1:

The north, circular ballroom. The left wall of the ballroom has several niches with 
pillars in them. Walk towards the inner part of the ballroom, near a blue sofa, and 
try to whack some of the pillars. Look for a niche which does not have any decoration 
behind the pillar. If you managed to knock down the  pillar, push the wall behind 
it to gain access to the first loft, where a Stealth rifle is. The end of the loft 
has 3 crucifixes and a crown too.

Secret #2:

push it; you can enter the third loft, where an Artefact of Life is, along with some 
gold.

Secret #4:

You are going to fight for this secret. Near the Y-junction at the east ballroom's 
entrance, there is a lever, which must be activated to complete the level. Next to 
that switch, there is another room behind those white pillars, where two Tasoths 
are. You shall need to kill them off, and pull the second switch as well.
Now, walk to the main junction, and go to the northwest, to the locked Blood door 
(not the one at the front). At halfway, between the two doors to the two living rooms, 
there is a small resting room, with a Priestess. You will notice that a passage has 
opened on the left, to a hidden Bronze key. Grab it, this will be important in the 
future.

them to access the fourth loft of the grand ballroom. There are five jewellery boxes 
and a backpack full of ammunition.

Every time you have tried, you were whisked away.
You shall need the hidden Bronze key to unlock this secret area. Return to the hallway 
with the white coloumns, where Secret area #2 is. Walk to the corner, where the hallway 
turns to the south. You will see a niche with two coloumns on the right, and try 
to knock one of them down. Open the wall behind it, so you will enter the second 
loft. First, you will get yourself four jewellery boxes and two crowns. At the end, 
there is a fissure gate at the end. This will teleport you inside that certain room 
with the three Artefacts.

Secret #7:

You must have found Secret area #4 and Secret area #6 to access this secret.
Before entering the fissure gate in Secret area #6, you might want to check the area 
out for some extra ammunition. The clear wall next to the second fire near the fissure 
gate opens a hidden armory with two 14mm clips, two 9mm clips, a box of 12,6mm and 
a bazooka.

The west ballroom has a clear piece of green marble wall between two flags. Push 
it to find yet another hidden armory with 8 piles of 12,6mm bullets and a SmartGun!!!

In the foyer near the Blood key. Push the eye symbol on the left wall to find a hidden 
chamber with an Artefact of Invulnerability!

Secret #10:

This "secret" is not a secret at all, and is mandatory to leave this floor. When 
you activate the elevator, it will slide away, revealing the elevator shaft, where 
two Black Apostles waiting for the kill! Make sure you're well prepared for this 
trap. You can collect some 9mm ammunition from the shaft once you've killed both 
of them.

Look for a T-junction, where a wooden door leads to the winecellar, and one more 
wooden door on the right. Take a few steps towards the second wooden door, and check 
the brickwall on your left. A small hidden area holds a jewellery box, a backpack 
full of ammo, and a bottle of absinthe.

Secret #3:

The north portico hallway which leads towards a locked Bronze door. There are archways 
and curtains on the right, and a vase. Push the wall right behind the vase to locate 
a hidden ammunition supply with 12,6mm boxes and some more bullets. This secret area 
has another entrance from beyond the Bronze door - near a black coloumn. You can 
open this second secret door from inside as well (it's the wall next to the second 
box of 12,6mm bullets), and get through this Bronze door without the necessity of 
the key. Watch out though - a LOT of Acolytes and Priestesses are behind!!!

of the conservatory,  where two Tasoths are. The second one's lair has a pushwall 
on the right. Open it, and you can collect the bottle of absinthe, the Artefact of 
Life, and open some more hidden areas.

Secret #6:

You must have found Secret area #5 to access this secret.
Push the wall between the marble table and the sofa to reveal a small niche with 
two boxes of 12,6mm and some spilled 12,6mm bullets.

Secret #7: 

You must have found Secret area #6 to access this secret.
After you have collected all the ammunition in Secret area #6, push that previously 
opened portion of the wall from the other side. Then push it some more. You will 
eventually find a hidden elevator taking you to super secret level 3 - Mirror rooms!


Secret #8:

To access the right choir of the lower conservatory, you'll have to use the fissure 
gate. Walk inside the room with the switch controlling the fireball launcher. The 
secret door is in the corner, next to the 9mm clip. Inside the choir, you can pick 
up the Blood key and access the locked room at the brown brick corridors.

Secret #1:

The treasure room at the start. When you enter, immediately turn to the left, and 
push the wall in the corner. You will find some crowns.

Secret #2:

This one is harder. Walk to the hallway leading to the fissure gate. You will see 
a candlestand. Now, start checking the walls with are LEFT from this candlestand, 
and you will soon find a hidden passage leading inside the wall of the reading room 
with chalices, bags of gold, and two crowns.

Secret #3:

The lavatory. Push the CENTRAL bottom wall to find a hidden section of the lavatory 
with an Artefact of Life. Watch out though,there are two Drones. From here, you can 
also access the southwest balcony with the treasure, and the blocked area in the 
reading room, where a Stealth rifle is, along with some 14mm ammo.

Secret #4:

Again, a hard one comes. This secret door is almost opposite the two locked Gold 
doors leading to the north library. There is a flickering lantern on the ceiling 
exactly opposite the pushwall. Try some of the walls, I am sure you will soon find 
it. This secret area is the northeast balcony with the Sabrine MK3.

Secret #5:

This one is inside the main library, the bottom part. Look for a knight armour and 
a vase near the wall. The secret door in next to the knight armour. It looks like 
there is a secret part of library, with two crowns and two bottles of fine absinthe.

of Secret area #5, look for another armored knight, and push the wall beside it. 
You will find two 9mm clips and some more 9mm ammo in there.

Secret #9:

In the living room behind the exit tunnelways. On the right, check the wall next 
to the plant. You will find a hidden area with four piles of 9mm bullets.

Secret #10:

You must have found Secret area #9 to access this secret.
In Secret area #9, go to the previously opened portion of the wall, and try the wall 
next to it! There is another small area, this time, with four piles of 12,6mm bullets.


Secret #11:

You must have found Secret area #10 to access this secret.
This time, you will have to push the wall many times. First, look around in the room 
of Secret #10. You will discover two pairs of lamps attached to the walls. Experiment 
with the bottom walls of this area, which are beyond these lamps. Once you have found 
the secret door, you will have to push it many times, until eventually you can let 
yourself into a secret room with 2 Artefacts of Life, 2 bottles of absinthe, behind 
breakable pillars.

Secret #12:

You must have found Secret area #14 to access this secret.
Push the bottom wall lamps on the wall where the box of jewels was in Secret area 
#14. You shall find a narrow corridor leading to a wooden door. Inside there are 
- a group of Black Apostles!!!


Level 20: Roundabout
====================

TOTAL SECRETS: 12


Secret #1:

OK, this is going to be a little bit hard. Leave the starting chamber via the left 
door, and check the left walls while walking upwards in the roundabout. Count how 
many flower ornaments you see on them. When you arrive to the third one, push it. 
There is a hidden junction behind - the narrow passage leads to a waiting Black Apostle, 
who is guarding a Suomi KP31 with some bullets. Proceed with caution. The wooden 
door here leads you to a restroom with a bottle of absinthe, and Lord supper, and 
eventually lets you behind the second torch with the Artefact of Life.

Secret #2:

The lounge with the piano. You will see a marble table and a sofa in the corner. 
Now, check the wall that is right next to the sofa! Another hidden junction awaits 
you - two Acolytes are guarding a Sabrine MK3 and a 12,6mm bullets box here. The 
door opens to a narrow, long corridor, which leads to the first torch with the jewels 
and the Artefact of Salvation. Take extra care when entering - the passage is heavily 
guarded by Tasoths.

Secret #3:

The lounge with the piano once again. At the bottom wall almost opposite the piano, 
a portion of the wall has a pair of tiny candles on it. You will need to push this 
wall to find a small treasure holding area. You will get 4 crucifixes here.

Secret #4:

The transfer area with the fissure gates. Push the wall which is exactly opposite 
the balustrade and the Invulnerability Artefact, thus, you can enter the area behind 
the third torch, where 4 crucifixes and a bottle of fine absinthe is.

Secret #5:

You must have found Secret area #4 to access this secret.
To access the fourth area behind the last torch, you will have to walk back to the 
entrance of Secret area #4. Try pushing the wall on the left, which is also made 
of red marble, rather than green. A door should be revealed. Behind the door, gold 
awaits you, and two plates of Lord supper.

Secret #6:

You ought to obtain the Artefact of Invulnerabilty before tempering with this secret, 
or else it will COST you!!!
This secret is pretty obvious - the fireball launcher's nook. Not the one where the 
fireballs dissipate, but the location of the fireball launcher itself. Once you obtain 
the Invulnerability Artefact, quickly rush back to the fireball launcher and run 
up to its hole! There is an Artefact of Life hidden in there and a backpack full 
of ammo!

Secret #7:

The north ballroom behind the wooden door. There is heavy resistance here, quite 
a few Black Apostles and Priestesses. At the opposite end of the ballroom, there 
is a small lounge with two marble tables. The walls next to this particular area 
has two secret areas. The left secret door is next to a plant in a ceramic pot. You 
can pick up three crowns and a chalice here.

Secret #8:

The second hidden area in the ballroom is right from the lounge, halfway between 
the wall and the plant in a pot. This small hidden compartment has four chalices, 
a crucifix and a box of jewels.

Secret #9:

The living room inside the central structure. You should see a shelf with various 
stuff stocked up in, right next to a credenza. Push the shelf, you will find a small 
hidden area with a switch. By pulling this switch, you can seal a pathway to a fissure 
gate, so the Unstoppables and the Ultradone will not be able to teleport behind you, 
and you can lead them into the spear trap (you will have to ambush the pillars first).


Secret #10:

The north segment of the inner structure, where you have found an armory with 4 rockets 
and two 12,6mm bullet piles, and there were knight armours. Make your way back to 
this small armory, and look for a white column. Now, to locate this secret, you shall 
have to push the wall which is left from the pillar! Behind you will find some jewels, 
an Artefact of Salvation, and a 9mm clip.

Secret #11:

The elevator key's lair. Push the right ornament here to reveal a hidden passage 
leading behind the fireball junction - behind that torch. You will meet an Acolyte 
here, guarding a 14mm clip and two 9mm clips.

Secret #12:

The toilette outside the roundabout. Walk behind the sink, and push the wall at the 
corner to reveal a secret Artefact of Life!


Level 21: Vibeke
================

TOTAL SECRETS: 8


Secret #1:

At the elevator foyer behind the locked Gold door. Near the second elevator, you 
shall witness a bag of gold lying under a torch. Open the wall behind the bag of 
gold to locate a hidden area with four crucifixes, four bottles of fine absinthe, 
and a box of jewels.

Secret #2:

The storage, next to the fenced off area. You will see a wooden box pushed inside 
a narrow path. You can move this box, and get behind it to the fenced off area, plus 
another branch of the storage room. You can collect some gold, ammunition, and a 
bottle of absinthe here. Just make sure you watch out for that pesky Suicide Drone 
behind the crates.

Secret #3:

Right next to the entrance to the fireball launcher-protected hallway. Just as soon 
as you leave the door, check the wall next to the door frame. You will find a hidden 
switch, which shall open Secret area #7 somewhere else in the level.

Secret #4:

Not a real secret, but it's a shortcut instead. A portion of the gray stone wall 
is pushable at the twisty hallway. It is opposite the dead Alliance member. If you're 
coming from the other direction, look for rusty chains hanging from the ceiling. 
The secret shortcut is there, just experiment a little.

Secret #5:

This may be a tough one, since it's pretty easy to mess this one up. Get past the 
junction with the white pillars, you will be at the guards' quarters, there are two 
open rooms on the right, and one wooden door to the left. Got the location? Now, 
it is imperative that you lure the Acolyte out, where he is, or you will not be able 
to push the blocking wall away. Make sure the Acolyte is not standing in the corner! 
Yes, the secret door is right at the corner, but you can't open it from here - a 
pile of dirt in the second room blocks it. So you have to enter the second room, 
walk to the pile of dirt, and push the wall from THERE. I assume now you understand 
how this works...
Ok, inside the secret area, you will find three boxes of 12,6mm and a box of jewels. 
Remember this small area - it will be imperative later to find the rest of the secrets!


Secret #6:

You must have found Secret area #5 to access this secret.
Try opening the left wooden braced wall next to the box of jewels! Inside a tiny 
lair, there is yet another switch, which opens Secret area #8.

Secret #7:

You must have found Secret area #3 and Secret area #5 to access this secret.
Well if you have already activated the switch in Secret area #3, you will see a narrow 
side passage leading you through the fireball launchers. I suggest you save your 
game here, a very tough part comes. You can't turn the fireball launchers off, you 
just have to cross them, preferably without burning up. This will be nasty, but after 
the third fireball launcher, you REALLY have to be prepared, as there is a Suicide 
Drone in a lair to the left! And if that's not enough, the passage eventually leads 
you to an evilness-filled lair, where a Superdrone is!!! Fighting him is futile, 
you shall have to lure it to the fireballs' path, hoping for the best. If everything 
goes right, the Superdrone dies, and you can pick up what it was guarding - a Bronze 
key!

Secret #8: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #6 and Secret area #7 to access this secret.
It will be quite obvious if you have found the two hidden levers and you have the 
Bronze key. The gray tunnel leading outside shall have an opening at its side. You 
will find a hidden elevator here - taking you to super secret level 4 - Hypercubed!!!



Level 22: Worlds collide
========================

TOTAL SECRETS: 14


Secret #1: 

Right at the start. You shall notice there are wooden torches in small niches at 
the left wall. Head towards the first two torches, and push the central portion of 
the gray stone wall here! You will find a hidden corridor with four bags of gold, 
four chalices, four crucifixes, and four vials of holy water.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Once you are inside the hidden corridor of Secret area #1, you will notice small 
nooks in both walls. Each of them holds a secret area for you. Let us check the first 
one on the left - there is a small, bare room with a corpse holding a Suomi machinegun 
and a 9mm clip.

Secret #3:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Next, check the first nook on the right! You will find yet another small, bare room 
with spilled 9mm and 12,6mm bullets.

Let us continue with the second nook on the left. You are going to discover a tilewalled 
corridor with some more spilled 9mm and 12,6mm bullets, two rocket grenades, and 
finally, four chalices and four boxes of jewels.

Secret #5:

You must have found Secret area #4 to access this secret.
At the end of this hidden tilewall corridor, where the jewels were, try pushing some 
of the tilewalls! One of them is a secret door, revealing a tiny walkway to an Artefact 
of Life!

Secret #6:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Finally, the second nook on the right. You will arrive yet another tile-covered cell, 
divided into portions. A Stealth rifle, some gold, a bottle of absinthe, and some 
lost 9mm bullets are here for you.

Secret #7:

After the first junction, proceed to the left, and it might also be a good idea to 
finalize some of the Tasoths, otherwise, they are going to be quite troublesome (you 
can let the "central" one live for now). So proceed to the left, towards the flags, 
but watch out for the nooks on the left (there are more Tasoths). After the third 
nook with the Tasoth, check the stone wall right before it start to curve - you will 
be rewarded with a hidden hallway, where you will find a bazooka at a shrine, and 
a lot of golden chalices & vials of holy water at the hallway's bottom.  

Secret #8:

You must have found Secret area #7 to access this secret.
At the end of this hidden corridor, there are two small secret rooms on both side, 
and both secret doors is next to a golden chalice. Face towards the windows, and 
take a few steps back. Now start pushing some of the left walls - eventually, you 
shall find the first secret room, where you can collect two rockets for your bazooka, 
a bottle of absinthe, two crowns and two golden chalices.

Secret #9:

You must have found Secret area #7 to access this secret.
Once you have located the previous secret, you surely want to find the second secret 
room on the right.  Just keep looking and you shall get the two bags of gold, and 
many boxes of jewels this secret room has for you.

Secret #10:

The cathedral where you fight Empress Diana. It has two naves - left and right. This 
secret is hidden at the left wing (there is a Sabrine MK3 here, the right wing has 
a Suomi). This is pretty hard to find - look for a knight armour standing opposite 
a diagonal portion of the wall! Press that wall, and you will find a hidden shortcut 
towards the altar. You can pick up two Artefacts of Salvation, two glasses and two 
bottles of fine absinthe, and a truckload of 9mm and 12,6mm bullets!
The alternate way to find this hidden area is to step among the flames at the altar, 
and push the left gray brickwall at the holy cross ornamented wall. Mind that the 
Empress shall follow you inside the secret passage, and if you get cornered - well 
then it's curtains for you.

Secret #11:

For this secret, you need to be at the right wing of the cathedral. Look for a knight 
statue again at an L-shaped hallway corner. There is also a window nearby. Now, push 
the stonewall at the corner to reveal yet another hidden passage - this one has two 
12,6mm boxes, two rockets, an Artefact of Salvation, bazooka, SmartGun, even some 
gold! 
This secret area also has an alternate way inside - you need to jump in the fire 
near the altar, and press the right gray stonewall at the holy cross ornament. Both 
this secret and Secret area #10 can be opened from the inside as well, leading you 
directly to the altar and the Artefact of Life without alerting up Empress Diana 
or her serveants.

Secret #12:

This does not count as a secret, but it is quite useful. At the left wing supply 
room near the Empress, the holy cross symbol wall can be moved, opening up a narrow 
escapeway in case you got stranded inside the supply room.

Secret #13:

This one does not count as a secret either. The right wing of the cathedral. You 
can push the wall next to the locked gate to open an extra escapeway, without the 
necessity of knocking down the coloumns.

Secret #14:

Also not a real secret, but a hidden short-cut - the mirror image of Secret #13. 
The tiny room containing the spilled 12,6mm bullets is separated with coloumns, but 
you can get past them by pushing the stonewall in the corner. This way you can let 
yourself through. Also note that the Empress is not willing to use this and the previous 
short-cut, she has to knock down the pillars to get you.


Level 23: Last bulwark
======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 12


Secret #1:

At the double Blood doors entrance, you will see a flag, and a coloumn behind. Knock 
down the coloumn and push the wall behind to reveal a hidden area with a small amount 
of 9mm and 12,6mm, rockets and a jewellery box.

Secret #2:

In the meeting room right at the start. You should see a sofa near the room's corner. 
Try opening the wall in the corner (not at the sofa) to find a hidden evil room with 
lots of gold-filled bags, jewels and a Stealth rifle as well!

Secret #2:

You must either be smart or suffer for this secret. It is at the gallery with the 
Black Apostles, and the crown at the top. There is also a barricade blocking your 
way to the doors, so you know what area I am talking about. Now, at the top, there 
is a small niche which is tripmined, and a bottle of absinthe is at the end under 
a painting. You must either lure some Acolytes and Suicide Drones into the niche, 
or step onto the mines. Push the painting on the wall to gain access inside the gallery. 
Here, you will find two 9mm clips, two 12,6mm boxes, gold and an Artefact of Life.


Secret #3:

This does not count as a secret, and is very important to complete the level. Walk 
to the barricade at the gallery, and push the box's side to move it away. Thus, you 
can get behind the barricade (the other way is to find Secret area #4).

Secret #4:

This secret has two entrances - you can access it from both sides of the barricade. 
If you did not get past the barricade, stand in the hallway exactly opposite the 
large wooden box, rub against the wall, and start checking it for the secret door. 
If you are coming from beyond the barricade, push the red marble wall exactly opposite 
the burning fire. Either way, you will find yourself in a tiny storage room with 
four crucifixes and a Sabrine MK3. You can open both secret doors from the inside 
as well, and get past the barricade.

Secret #5:

You shall have to suffer for this secret. Beyond the twin automatic doors, there 
is a junction - the right corridor is barricaded by explosive barrels, and there 
is also a puddle of sludge. You have no choice but to step in the sludge. If you 
have survived, you can open the secret door which is on your right. You are going 
to find a small treasure room with bags of gold, chalices and an Artefact of Salvation.


Secret #6:

Not far from Secret area #5, the left branch of the junction, where the blood key 
is. The blood key is surrounded with tripmines, and the two walls in the corner of 
the niche are secret doors. You have two options here. You may either lure some Acolytes 
to defuse the tripmines & kill themselves during the process, or take severe damage 
and defuse the mines by yourself. Either way, the two mines at the two corners must 
go. If you successfully cleaned out the corner, you can press the bottom wall to 
find an Artefact of Life and some gold at the end of a narrow corridor.

Secret #7:

Next to Secret area #6. The wall in the second corner is also a secret door (you 
have to remove that mine somehow). You will find a treasure chamber with various 
gold stuff here, and a hidden elevator key!

Secret #8:

This secret area is extremely well-hidden, and you don't have the chance to open 
it without being invulnerable. Recognize the treasure chamber with the spear traps 
lock-down? There are two small nooks on both side of the spear trap line. The secret 
door is at the bottom of the right nook, where the red marble-tilewall changes into 
the average marble-moonstone wall. To open it, however, you must obtain an Artefact 
of Invulnerability first, or else you will die trying. You were warned.
Once you've ruined the spear traps, and managed to crawl inside that small nook, 
it is time to push the wall. A narrow hidden corridor you will see, leading you to 
a small red chamber with pillars, and a switch. Take extra care when stepping inside 
- there are two Black Apostles guarding the switch, behind balustrades, plus two 
Tasoths are hiding behind those pillars. The switch here will open the super secret 
area of this level.
NOTE: Pulling the switch will trigger an alarm somewhere in the bulwark - Black Apostles 
and Priestesses will arrive to final you. Watch out for them!

Secret #9:

Not a real secret, but it might be useful. When you reach the exit of the falanster 
via the fissure gate, you might want to reenter for some food and stuff you left 
behind. To find the fissure gates which transport you back, you will have to check 
the walls at the corner of the two hallways which lead to the three sealed doors. 
These two secret doors are near the two statues which are holding a bowl. Behind 
lies a small hidden corridor, which takes you to two fissure gates. Both of the fissure 
gates will teleport you to the gallery where the Tasoth trap was set. 

Secret #10:

You must have found Secret area #9 to access this secret.
If your prying eyes are in good condition, you ought to see an Artefact of Invulnerability 
behind the fissure gates at Secret area #9, but you could not obtain it so far. The 
solution is pretty simple, however; just push the gray stonewall that is right between 
the two fissure gates, and not only you can grab the Artefact of Invulnerability, 
but you can also collect a crown, two Artefacts of Salvation, and two bottles of 
absinthe!

Secret #11:

Right at the exit from the falanster. Just before the stone pillars, and behind them, 
the great outdoors, there is a narrow passage leading to the left. You can get a 
box of 12,6mm ammunition here. Eventually, you will arrive to a rusty steel door. 
Open it, and follow the narrow passageway up to a small tower with a sole room. You 
will find a Lord supper, two bottles of absinthe, a glass of absinthe, and an Artefact 
of Salvation here.

Secret #12: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #7, Secret area #8 and Secret area #11 to access 
this secret.
Despite the super secret area is pretty hard to find, it will be quite obvious if 
you have pulled the lever at Secret area #8, and you have found the small tower room 
of Secret area #11. One of the bookshelves has moved away, revealing a short dark 
tunnel leading to a locked elevator gate. You shall need the elevator key from Secret 
area #7 to enter. This elevator takes you to the final super secret level - Honour!!!



Level 24: No man's land
=======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 7


Secret #1:

North from the stone monolith with the wells, there is a tiny passageway, fire burning 
at its opening. A Drone will charge you from there, so be on alert. Enter this tiny 
passage and look for a pile of rocks on the right. Press the building's brickwall 
next to this pile of rocks, where nothing is on the ground, thus you can access the 
northern building's battlement. You can grab the killed Acolytes' and Priestesses' 
dropped ammo, and you also have the opportunity to snatch some more 9mm ammunition 
and a 14mm bullet clip as well. A Suicide Drone will arrive to mince you, don't let 
him. A little bit farther, you can collect a 9mm clip and a bottle of fine absinthe. 
At the end of the battlement, there is a tiny court with some treasure.

Secret #2:

Next to this building, there is the fence. Enter the small area between the building's 
battlement and the fence, and look for a well. Push the brickwall between the well 
and the tree to access a hidden side court of the building with two 9mm clips and 
a stem of wormwood. You can also get a glimpse of Secret area #6, the green glowing 
Artefact.

Secret #3:

This one is not a secret, and is essential to pass this level. The wooden box behind 
the barrel is pushable. Once you got rid of the barrel, push it to find a storage 
area with some 9mm ammunition, a bottle of absinthe, and rockets. If you're stuck 
on this zone, you should think about messing around with the wooden box.

Secret #4:

Also does not count as a secret. After you've moved the wooden box away, and cleaned 
out the storage, push the box again - this time, its right side. This is the only 
way to get inside one of the buildings and deactivate the fireball launcher. 

Secret #5:

Inside the building. Just right after you have jumped through the fissure gate, turn 
around and push the beautifully ornamented wall. There is a narrow gallery behind, 
where quite a lot of enemies are waiting to give you a warm welcome - three Priestesses 
and a Black Apostle. They will come from all 3 directions of this gallery, and unfortunately, 
they are smart enough not to follow you outside, so I suggest you should use Stealth 
rifle. This small gallery stretches out from the living room to the library, and 
has a 9mm clip, rockets, some 12,6mm ammo and an Artefact of Salvation for you. The 
switch opens Secret area #6 for you.

Secret #6:

You must have found Secret area #5 to access this secret.
Once you have pulled the switch at the hidden gallery, return to the tiny passageway 
of Secret #1, to the building's perimeter with the graves. Head towards the right, 
and you will discover that the stone wall is gone, and you can collect the Artefact 
of Life.

Secret #7:

The final secret of this level is left from the Bronze exit door. Follow the building 
wall until it disappears in the shrubbery. Inspect the building walls before the 
shrubbery and you will find a pushwall. Behind, you can enter the sealed courtyard, 
and get a Sabrine MK3 plus some 12,6mm ammunition. You can also wander off the forest 
and look for an abandoned cemetery. On your way, you may collect plenty of wormwood. 
Arriving at the cemetery, you will find a very useful Artefact of Regeneration along 
with a couple of crucifixes!


Level 25: Postludium
====================

TOTAL SECRETS: 17


Secret #1:

It is on the green marble hallway between the circular chamber and the chapel. Facing 
the holy cross, start pushing the walls right after the chamber narrows back into 
a hallway. There is a small hidden area with four piles of 9mm bullets and four boxes 
of 12,6mm ammunition.

Secret #2:

Exactly opposite the entrance to Secret area #1. Push that wall, and you are going 
to find a narrow passage leading to a door. Behind the door, there is the small sealed 
away balcony behind the Tasoth, where you can grab some rockets, a golden chalice 
and a crucifix.

Secret #3:

Inside the gold key's room. The first pair of black columns has a beautifully ornamented 
wall portion next to them. Push the left one to gain access into a hidden side chamber 
with a lever. This will open Secret area #7 for you. Mind that pulling the switch 
will alert up quite a few Acolytes, who will start looking for you...

Secret #4:

Exactly opposite Secret area #3. Push the ornamented wall next to the black coloumn 
to find an identical side chamber with yet another switch. This opens Secret area 
#8, and alerts up a second flock of Acolytes...so keep your Sabrine MK3 ready for 
them.

Secret #5:

Also in the gold key's room, next to the second pair of black coloumns. You shall 
witness that next to the coloumns, the walls are decorated with the all-seeing eye. 
Push the left one to reveal a small treasure chamber with a few pieces of gold, and 
an Artefact of Life!

Secret #6:

Exactly opposite Secret area #5. Opening the second all-seeing eye wall reveals a 
fourth side chamber with lots of ammunition - 9mm bullet piles, many boxes of 12,6mm 
ammunition, and a backpack!

Secret #7:

You must have found Secret area #3 or Secret area #16 to access this secret.
Scurry back to the circular room with green marble walls. At the hallway corner, 
there are a few white pillars - smash them, there should be a door behind. The door 
takes you to the right side of the teleport chamber, where an Invulnerability and 
Fury Artefact awaits!

Secret #8:

You must have found Secret area #4 or Secret area #17 to access this secret.
To find this secret, you will have to rush back to the brown brick hallway opposite 
the entrances to the red stone circular hallway. Smash the right white pillar and 
you will see yet another door. This door opens to the left walkway at the teleport 
chamber's side. Here, you can grab another Invulnerability and Fury Artefacts.

Secret #9:

You must have found Secret area #8 to access this secret.
Push the brickwall right next to the wooden door to find a tiny compartment with 
a bag of gold.

Secret #10:

You must have found Secret area #9 to access this secret.
Search the back wall of this small compartment to find yet another small niche with 
a chalice.

Secret #11:

You must have found Secret area #10 to access this secret.
Once again, start pushing the bottom walls of Secret area #9 to find an identical 
small niche with a box of jewels.

Secret #12:

You must have found Secret area #11 to access this secret.
Same thing here. Bottom of this hidden area, experiment until you find the fourth 
small cubicle with a crucifix.

Secret #13: (Super secret area)

You must have found Secret area #12 to access this secret.
Push the bottom wall where the crucifix was. This time, a hidden corridor you will 
see. Follow the tunnel to a rusty steel door and open it. There is a whole truckload 
of treasure is hidden in this underground room! You can grab tons of gold here, and 
3 Artefacts of Salvation too!

Secret #14:

At the hallway leading to the green circular chamber. Look for two knights with a 
golden pentagram between them. This is the secret door. Push it - you will find a 
door, leading you to a hidden red room with an Artefact of Life and two bottles of 
fine absinthe.

Secret #15:

Push the wood panelling holy cross behind the fissure gate to gain access to the 
central walkway, where two Artefacts of Life are.

Secret #16: 

You must have found Secret area #15 to access this secret.
It is only a "semi-secret" along with Secret area #17 - if you could not find the 
switches, you can still grab the Artefact of Invulnerability and the Artefact of 
Fury from here (they will be useful for the final fight for saving Vibeke). Just 
walk along Secret area #15 to the right, where you run into a wall. Push it, and 
there - you can get both artefacts and the credit for the secret.

Secret #17:

You must have found Secret area #15 to access this secret.
Exactly the same with Secret area #16, except you have to walk to the left along 
the narrow walkway. Push the blocking wall - you know the rest. If you did not found 
the switch earlier, this will count as a secret.


Level 26: Endgame
=================

TOTAL SECRETS: 4


Secret #1:

It is extremely hard to pinpoint the location of secrets here in the afterlife, as 
most of the areas are identical to each other, and there are very few things which 
would distinguish an area from another, but I will try. 
From your starting location, head all the way to the right (avoid the ghosts) until 
you arrive to a wall where you see three gravestones, and a skeleton adjacent to 
the first gravestone. Here, the corner of the wall should be ornamented with holy 
crosses. Push this particular wall to find a hidden area with an Artefact of Life.


Secret #2:

Behind your starting location, there is a wider area where an Artefact of Life lies 
between two stakes with skulls. Opposite this Artefact, there is a Regeneration Artefact 
behind the graveyard walls. The wall here is ornamented with two full moons. Push 
the wall exactly behind the Artefact which does not have any decoration on it - this 
will reveal two Artefacts of Life!

Secret #3:

Exactly opposite your entry to the afterlife, there is an Artefact of Life behind 
a portion of graveyard walls which has gravestones on many niches. Now, look for 
a very narrow passage to the left, which has a pile of bones at the entrance. Enter 
here to the bottom, and push the right wall which has a full moon decoration. You 
will find a third hidden area with an Artefact of Life here.

Secret #4:

Very hard to locate. From Secret area #2, head to the north (facing the Regeneration 
Artefact at the bottom, it should be to the left). Keep going upwards until you find 
another Artefact of Regeneration surrounded by graves. Look for an angel statue here. 
Almost opposite the angel statue, there is a small nook with a pile of bones and 
a grave. Push the wall behind the pile of bones, so you can have another Artefact 
of Life.


Secret level 1: South side
==========================

TOTAL SECRETS: 5


Secret #1: 

Once you walk out of the battlement from behind the Blood door, walk to the falanster 
wall that is directly opposite the blood door, and push it. A hidden courtyard is 
behind with two bags of gold, some 9mm and 12,6mm bullets scattered around, and a 
bottle of absinthe in a nook. This secret area can be accessed from Secret area #2 
as well, and you will get the credit for the secret once you find the way out.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 or Secret area #4 to access this secret.
The second battlement leading to the guard post is full of Suicide Drones, mind them 
once you enter the area. If you are coming from the courtyard of Secret #1, you will 
have to push the bottom of the second nook, which does not have a bottle of absinthe. 
Follow the second battlement, killing Suicide Drones in the process, and eventually, 
you will reach the guard post. You will see corpses lying around - looks like Twirl 
and his boys did a great job taking down some of the guards. The first thing you 
will notice is a glowing Artefact of Life. You can also collect two more bottles 
of fine absinthe here, plus 9mm and 12,6mm ammunition is also stored here. Watch 
out for Acolytes shooting you from the outdoor area - they don't want you to snoop 
around. 
If you are using the fissure gate to enter here, you will have to locate the secret 
pushwall at the C-curve of the battlement leading to the sealed door. It is opposite 
the battlement, and will take you to Secret area #1 (you might have to push the wall 
twice).

Secret #3:

This one is quite hard to pinpoint despite the fact that is not really well-hidden 
at all. It is a small pathway somewhere among the hedges between the two rock formations. 
Once you have reached the first rock formations with the gothic streetlamps, head 
to the north. Watch out for the Acolytes and more importantly, the tripmines - they 
are everywhere. The entrance of the hidden pathway is near a pile of dirt with a 
PCV - the remainings of a Drone. Look around, you should see small bushes nearby. 
Walk through these bushes (be careful! There is a tripmine nearby!) and you will 
discover this hidden pathway between the hedges where you will find one of Twirl's 
henchmen dead. He has a Sabrine MK3 and 12,6mm ammunition which you can use better 
than he did. Plus, you can also grab three stems of wormwood.

Secret #4:

The second rock formation with the torches and the gravestones - sort of a small 
fort or glade. Looking through the torches, you will see lots of useful things behind, 
but how could you get them? The entrance is filled with tripmines, and there are 
many Acolytes inside, guarding the supplies well! 
Um, well, you have two choices here. You perform a frontal assault, killing the Acolytes, 
and walking through the tripmines, hoping that you will survive (not advised), or 
you can use your brain, and make the Acolytes come out! I think you can imagine what 
this means - they all step on the tripmines, and die, clearing the path for you. 
This only works, however, if you don't shoot any of the Acolytes inside, just show 
yourself to piss them off, and they will blindly fell in their own trap. Either way, 
you can get inside this stone fort, and collect what lies inside: a 9mm clip, a box 
of 12,6mm, some more 12,6mm, an Artefact of Invulnerability, and a bottle of fine 
absinthe! The fissure gate here teleports you to Secret area #2.

Secret #5:

Inside the cemetery, there is a central stone monolith, which contains an Artefact 
of Invulnerability in its stomach, but it's hard to locate the secret door to get 
it. Look for a statue of an angel and push the wall in the stone monolith's corner 
to find it.


Secret level 2: Wormhole
========================

TOTAL SECRETS: 5


Secret #1:

Not far from your starting elevator, there is a banner on the brickwall right next 
to a burning torch. Push this wall to find a small treasure room filled with gold!


Secret #2:

The hallway which opens from the starting corridor has two coloumns. Break them and 
push the wall behind; you shall find a narrow hidden passage leading to a secret 
elevator! This is the entrance to Challenge I, but you will need to locate the elevator 
key for it.

Secret #3:

In the priestess' room, push the bare brickwall next to the small bookshelf (not 
at the Blood key!) to find a hidden area with various supplies: rockets, 9mm ammunition, 
some jewels, and absinthe.

Secret #4:

In the room with the gray stone and the fenced-off area with the backpack. You will 
see the fence is connected to gray stone pillars. Now, inspect the wall that is exactly 
opposite the first stone pillar! A hidden outer hallway will be revealed with a dead 
Black Apostle. You can take his SmartGun and the 12,6mm bullets, I am sure he will 
not mind. The locked Blood door behind has a tiny area with an Artefact of Life and 
two crucifixes.

Secret #5:

The first guard post with the Drone and the Black Apostles has a switch (it is not 
necessary to activate it if you have pulled the other one). It is pretty hard to 
pinpoint the location of the secret door in this narrow passage; facing towards the 
grate, it should be somewhere on the left wall, and opens to a large treasure vault 
filled with various valuables!


Secret level 3: Sssssh!
=======================

TOTAL SECRETS: 16


Secret #1:

Almost exactly opposite your starting position, not far from the wooden torch. Start 
checking the walls that are right from the steel torch to find this small hidden 
room with two bottles of absinthe. 

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Not a real secret, but it will get you behind the locked Bronze door early. Not far 
from the two absinthe bottles in the hidden room, you should see a pile of dirt on 
the ground. Push the wall behind the dirt pile to gain access to the hallway behind 
the Bronze door. This way you can grab the Stealth rifle earlier (once you dispatch 
those Black Apostles).

Secret #3:

The narrow passage leading to the Artefact of Life that is behind the flag has several 
side chambers - some of them has treasures, some of them has traps. One of these 
small side chambers has stained glass at its bottom. Find this particular side chamber 
and push the stained glass to reveal a hidden area with jewels, a chalice, and two 
14mm ammunition clips.

Secret #4:

The entry chamber with the brown stone walls has three storage rooms - the first 
one contains barrels and vials of holy water. At the bottom of the chamber, you will 
see a vial right at the wall. Push this particular wall to find an underground cave 
with a few pieces of gold and an Artefact of Life.

Secret #5:

The meeting room with the green marble pillars. There is a large interior green marble 
structure at the bottom, which you will see as soon as you enter here through the 
wooden door. Carefully crawl to the bottom of this area following the green marble 
structure (make sure you will not get killed). Not far from the second wooden door, 
you will notice that one of the wall lights is not functioning. Push this particular 
wall to reveal a hidden area with a badly needed Artefact of Fury!

Secret #6:

It is hidden at the hallway behind the wooden door that is at the bottom of the meeting 
room. Take a few steps away from the door, and start checking the walls on your left! 
One of the brown stone walls is a secret pushwall, and there is a small treasure 
room behind with jewels and chalices.

Secret #7:

Just a spitting distance from Secret area #6. Check the walls which are between the 
two neonlights. A second small treasure vault is here with more jewels and crucifixes.


Secret #8:

Almost next to Secret area #7: press the brown stone wall with the neonlight and 
you will discover a hidden hallway leading to a small armory. Two pillars are blocking 
your way - smash them with your dagger. Behind, you can find two PCVs, 12,6mm bullets, 
a bottle of absinthe, and some 14mm bullets as well.

Secret #9:

The L-shaped dining room with the Priestess has a neonlight wall that is not lit, 
and rockets can be picked up here. Push this particular wall to find a narrow hidden 
area with a bazooka and a 9mm clip.

Secret #10:

To find this secret area, you must get behind the locked Gold door somehow (alerting 
the guards inside, and stabbing one of them to death at the door), and pull the switch 
that is inside. Go back to the entry hallway with the brown stone walls and the three 
storage rooms - you will notice that the bottom of the hallway is opened, leading 
you to a fissure gate. You can pick up some crucifixes here. Now, make sure you have 
at least 100% health, because the fissure gate will teleport you inside the small 
chamber that is behind the grates of the north feasting hall - with LOTS of enemies! 
There are spear traps at the grate, so the Courbée Dominate flunkies will kill themselves. 
Some Black Apostles are attacking from behind the sealed gate however, do your best 
to avoid them (it is wise to have a Stealth rifle when you enter the fissure gate, 
so you can finish them off). This hidden room has an Artefact of Regeneration, a 
SmartGun, two 12,6mm crates, and a glass of absinthe. 
Also take into account that the fissure gate here will teleport you to the chamber 
of Tasoths!!! This can be fatal if you don't scram right away to safety, but it can 
be also useful if you step behind the Black Apostles and Drones, and let the Tasoth 
do the dirty work for you (if you alert them up, you are doomed).

Secret #11:

Although this one does not count as a secret, it is...and it's also mandatory to 
locate and find Secret area #14. Not far from the Bronze key, you shall see two small 
nooks with a chalice and a crucifix in them, and a brown brickwall separates them. 
It appears to be a neat idea to grab the crucifixes before operating the pushwall 
or else it'll slide onto one of the crucifixes. So! If you have cleaned out these 
nooks, push the latter portion of the separating brown brickwall. You will find a 
tiny hole with a badly needed Stealth rifle!

Secret #12:

Almost next to Secret area #11, there are two bottles of absinthe and two hanging 
plants. The brown brickwall here is decorated with banners. Both of these banner-decorated 
walls are secret doors, you can push them from either side. The left one will take 
you to a hidden side chamber with two boxes of 12,6mm. You can also have a view of 
a hidden central hallway where an Ultradrone is! That hallway is also a secret area, 
but you shall have to get rid of the Ultradrone to enter there. If you are willing 
to kill him off, save your game, and make sure the Ultradrone will NOT die in front 
of the stained glass, or you will not be able to access Secret area #14.

Secret #13:

Opposite Secret area #12 - open the right brown brick with banner to find an identical 
side chamber with two more boxes of 12,6mm and a view of Secret area #14. Watch out 
for the Ultradrone if you have not killed him yet!

Secret #14:

You must have found Secret area #11 and either Secret area #12 or #13 to access this 
secret.
Return to the small hole where you have found the hidden Stealth rifle. If you have 
not alerted up the Ultradrone yet, you will not be able to open the pushwall. If 
you did, and the pushwall still refuses to open, you might have to try a couple of 
times, as he must be stalking at the other side (in the worst case, you killed him 
right in front of the pushwall, and you're forced to restart the whole level to open 
this secret). All in all, you shall have to push the stained glass in the hidden 
hole to enter that hidden hallway. At the end of the hallway, a hidden elevator is, 
taking you to super secret level 1 - Greed! Also keep in mind that there are two 
more Ultradrones guarding the hidden elevator, and it would be a foolish idea to 
get past them by outrunning. Read Secret area #15, this will save you a LOT of trouble 
with the three Ultradrones (the first Ultradrone guarding the secret door can be 
lured out).

Secret #15:

Left from the bronze key, there is a long, narrow corridor leading you to a single 
resting room with an absinthe. Push the wall next to the absinthe to reveal the resting 
room's true treasure - an Artefact of Invulnerability & an Artefact of Fury! With 
these, you can easily destroy all Ultradrones at Secret area #14, plus mince a few 
Tasoths as well.

Secret #16:

It will be quite hard to find this hidden area. You must return to the brown stone 
hallways where a Tasoth is, and a Drone was attacking you along with some Acolytes 
(get rid of them with the help of the Tasoth). Enter the wooden door, you will arrive 
to a junction. Turn right. Start checking the left walls not far from the opening 
to this junction, and you will find a secret room with an Artefact of Fury and an 
Artefact of Salvation.


Secret level 4: Goodbye Kitty!
==============================

TOTAL SECRETS: 10


Secret #1:

Quite close to your starting elevator, there is a plant in a ceramic pot at the right. 
Push the wall at the right to reveal a hidden treasure chamber.

Secret #2:

Again, close to your starting position, but on the left. You ought to find a table 
with chairs. Start checking the walls, which are left from this furniture to find 
another treasure chamber!

Secret #3:

Next to Secret area #2. Another table with chairs, but this time, there is a bottle 
of absinthe which you can get. This time, you shall have to push two walls to find 
this secret. Study the two walls next to the absinthe carefully, and first, push 
the outer one. Then step to the now-empty space and push the inner wall part. This 
will reveal the treasure chamber you can see from outside the hallway. Plenty of 
gold can be collected here along with an Artefact of Life!

Secret #4:

The ammunition stash behind the white pillars has two all-seeing eye ornaments. Push 
the left one to find a second treasure room with mostly crucifixes and bags of gold.


Secret #5:

The cellar where you obtain the Bronze key. It is highly advised to collect some 
bottles of absinthe before exploring this one, or collect the Artefact of Life from 
Secret area #3. Once you arrive to the Bronze key, you have to cross a third fireball 
launcher's stream. You can not turn it off (or the other two fireball launchers for 
that matter), thus you will suffer severe wounds while finding this secret. So, take 
a deep breath and run inside the tunnel where the fireballs are flying. The left 
wall has a small opening to an underground chamber with a switch. Activating this 
switch will open the super secret area. Now here comes the hard part: running back 
to the cellar - alive! Getting your absinthe out of your pocket may help you surviving 
the run back.

Secret #6: (Super secret area)

Go back to the elevator, you will witness that the control panel is gone, and a hidden 
elevator door is revealed. Walk through it to find a secret elevator taking you to 
super secret level 2 - Time-runner!!! You will still need the elevator key to proceed 
though.

Secret #7:

Inside the dungeon. The dungeon hallway's corner has a flickering lantern, exactly 
opposite the fissure gate which takes you back to the falanster. Walk straight under 
the flickering lantern and try pressing some of the dungeon walls near the cell door. 
There is a short secret tunnel, where an Artefact of Life and Artefact of Salvation 
awaits you behind a puddle of slime, which you must suffer.

Secret #8:

You must have found Secret area #7 to access this secret.
Right from the opening of Secret area #7, turn to the left, and give a good push 
to the wall in the corner. You will get inside the last cell and find a SmartGun 
here.

Secret #9:

The arena of Hello Kitty. From the entry door, you will see a bazooka and holy water 
vials at the right. Lose Hello Kitty for a short time and press the wall here in 
the corner. You will find a hidden cell with some Lord's supper, a backpack, two 
Artefacts of Salvation and two holy water vials. Rockets, 9mm bullets and 12,6mm 
bullets also can be picked up here.

Secret #10:

The upper part of the Hello Kitty arena. This secret area has two entrances, so Hello 
Kitty will not corner you here (hopefully). The first entrance is north from Secret 
area #9, almost opposite the wooden barricade. The second one is located where you 
can pick up the Stealth rifle, next to a few rockets against the wall. You can pick 
up a SmartGun inside, with two 12,6mm boxes and more 12,6mm ammunition just in case 
you've missed Secret area #8. This should help killing Hello Kitty!!! 
The secret doors can be opened at the dead ends from the inside if Hello Kitty follows 
you here.


Super secret level 1: Greed
===========================

TOTAL SECRETS: 4


Secret #1:

You will need the Bronze key for this. Near the starting elevator, you will see two 
Bronze doors. The left one has a rusty steel vault with a sole Suicide Drone (it 
is wise to obtain the PCV from the exit elevator before tempering with secrets). 
Kill the Suicide Drone, and push the bottom wall of this empty vault. You will find 
a hidden armory with two piles of 9mm, two 9mm clips and a Blood key.

Secret #2:

The right locked Bronze door. When you open it, you will find an identical empty 
vault with a Suicide Drone. Provided that you have found Secret area #1, you should 
have enough bullets to kill the pesky Suicide Drone. Push the bottom wall of the 
vault to find another hidden armory with a bazooka and 4 rockets.

Secret #3:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Near the exit elevator, there are two locked Blood doors. Facing the elevator, turn 
to the left. A narrow red stone warren you will see, with a Suicide Drone inside. 
Kill it, and push the bottom wall here. This time, you are going to find a backpack 
full of ammo, two 12,6mm boxes and some spilled 12,6mm bullets.

Secret #4:

Finally, the right narrow red stone warren with the fourth Suicide Drone. Push the 
bottom wall here to find a hidden room with two Artefacts of Life!


Super secret level 2: Time-runner
=================================

TOTAL SECRETS: 3


Secret #1: 

This secret is very hard to locate - it's very well hidden, plus you have very little 
time left to look for secrets. It is at the left side of the area (the one with the 
starting elevator). You have to find the long hallway, with a red curtain & golden 
pentagram at the middle. The secret door is near the opening to the chamber where 
the elevator key is. There is a hanging lantern near the secret door, which is on 
the left wall, after the red curtains with the golden pentagram. Behind the secret 
door, a tiny area is with a switch - it opens Secret area #2.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
The left side of the level. Rush back to the study near the locked Bronze door with 
the torches. You will discover that a portion of the wall have been moved, revealing 
a small hidden compartment with a SmartGun and two 12,6mm boxes. Note that it's absolutely 
not guaranteed that you can kill everyone even with this SmartGun, but you can try...


Secret #3:

This secret is at the right side of the level - the side with the exit elevator. 
Look for a small room made of brown stone, where a backpack is. You will notice that 
one of the lights is out of order. Push the wall OPPOSITE the non-functioning light 
to find an Artefact of Invulnerability and an Artefact of Fury!  You can try killing 
the whole Courbée Dominate army with these, but it's very unlikely that you will 
succeed in mere 30 seconds.


Super secret level 3: Mirror Rooms
==================================

TOTAL SECRETS: 8

Secret #1:

In the starting hall, turn to the left until you arrive to a room with torches and 
a PCV. You can also see the locked-away Gold key here. Look for a knight armour next 
to the wall in the corner,and push the wall next to the knight. A hidden hallway 
you will discover, leading you to an Artefact of Regeneration, two rockets and an 
Artefact of Life!

Secret #2:

In the storage room. There is an inner structure with an Invulnerability Artefact, 
which cannot be accessed by normal means - it has two entrances alright, but both 
are blocked. Don't bother climbing the barrels, as you will have to push the wooden 
box away from the entry door. Look for some spider webs hanging from the ceiling 
here, and push the wooden box away which is near the spider webs. There - now you 
can enter the inner storage room, and collect the Artefact and everything else...


Secret #3:

You must have found Secret area #2 to access this secret.
This does not count as a secret, but it'll definitively save you a LOT of trouble. 
Once you've made it inside the inner storage structure, look for a sniper rifle. 
Pick it up - there, now you have a sniper rifle. Then, push the wooden box away, 
which is right at the sniper rifle! A hidden switch you will see. If you pull it, 
the way to the Gold key will open.

Secret #4:

You must have found Secret area #2 to access this secret.
This does not count as a secret either, but is is extremely useful anyways. Stay 
here inside the inner storage structure, and look for a golden chalice between the 
crates. Once you found it, push the crate next to the golden chalice. There is a 
second hidden switch, this opens the passageway to the Bronze key. This will buy 
you some time, however, you will still need to explore the tapestry-covered wall 
area for the Blood key.

Secret #5:

Still in the storage room, not far from the sealed-away inner structure. To the left, 
you should see narrow pathways, one of them has a pile of 12,6mm bullets, and a huge 
wooden crate is blocking the way. Why don't you try pushing the box away? This way, 
you can explore the storage area, collect a Backpack full of ammo, and a bottle of 
fine absinthe!

Secret #6:

Wow, this storage room is surely full of hidden surprises! Near the entrance, you 
should see three neonlights on the left - one of them is not functioning. Don't temper 
with the lights, as the secret door is at the brown stone wall portion NEXT to this 
three lights! Push the wall at the central portion to discover 4 boxes of hidden 
jewels.

Secret #7:

The east part of the storage room where the two Tasoths are. This part of the storage 
area has several niches at the wall with neonlights. The niche at the very corner 
has two piles of 9mm and no light. Push the right wall inside the niche, and you 
shall find a small hidden nook with an Artefact of Life.

Secret #8:

In the lounge with the fireplace. You should see a vial of holy water at the fireplace. 
Push the brickwall behind this flask, and you'll discover a hidden treasure room, 
where you can grab lots of gold, two drinks and a bottle of absinthe.


Super secret level 4: Hypercubed!!!
===================================

TOTAL SECRETS: 1


Secret #1: (Super secret area)

The only secret is how to complete the level, so you can't miss it. I'm afraid I 
can't give you any solutions this time, as the hypercube is constantly rotating and 
changing, and so is the way to the exit. If you can find a way out of this four-dimensional 
polytope, you will get your reward: 4 Artefacts of life, 4 Artefacts of Salvation, 
a PCV and a backpack full of ammo!!!
(If you lose all your weapons at the start of Level 22, why should I give you a SmartGun?)



Super secret level 5: Honour
============================

TOTAL SECRETS: 2

Secret #1:

In your starting room, there are two shelves with lots of various stuff stacked onto 
them. Press the left one to gain access to a sealed-away balcony with two glasses 
of absinthe, and an Artefact of Life. This might help you staying alive a little 
longer.

Secret #2:

It is very unlikely that you will make THIS far, but I'll tell you this secret anyways. 
Near the line of green marble pillars and the explosive barrels, you should see a 
painting on the north wall. Push this wall quickly, and you'll make it inside a big 
treasure chamber with LOTS of gold, and the most important - an Invulnerability Artefact! 
But also watch out for those Tasoths...if you can't get to the Artefact quickly, 
you're minced.


Challenge 1:
============

TOTAL SECRETS: 7


Secret #1: 

Not long after you leave the initial elevator, you'll arrive to a pair or rusty doors, 
taking you to the spear traps gauntlet. Just before you enter, look at the last pair 
of torches before the door. The walls between each pair of torches is a hidden pushwall. 
The left one will take you to a small burial chamber, with two sacks of gold, some 
jewels, a tiny amount of bullets, vials of holy water, a bottle of absinthe, and 
a Savegame Artefact.

Secret #2:

Exactly opposite the first secret; there is another burial chamber with four chalices 
and four jewels.

Secret #3:

After the spear traps gauntlet, you should see the switch-controlled pushwall leading 
out - and next to the door, there are four narrow passages (the left two leads to 
some bags of gold). Check out the first passage on the right, its bottom wall has 
some chains and shackles attached to it. Push this particular wall to find a hidden 
cave with some gold.

Secret #4:

The dark brick corridor with the Tasoths. Just before you reach the small holding 
cell with the grates (this is where you trick the Tasoths to destroy themselves), 
there is a hidden pushwall just before the Tasoth firing missiles to the tunnel. 
It is on the left wall, just right next to the Tasoth - unless you can stab it to 
death, you really should not bother opening this door just yet. Wait till the end 
of the course, and return. This here hidden chamber has two Artefacts of Life!

Secret #5:

The left tunnel guarded by a Tasoth. One of the hiding spots has a vial of holy water 
in it. Push the wall behind the vial to reveal a hidden holy cross-shaped room with 
two bottles of fine absinthe, and a crucifix.

Secret #6:

After the barrels, you will arrive to another passage with some 9mm ammo lying around. 
On the left, there are a pile of bones. Push this wall behind the pile of bones to 
find a secret room with an Artefact of Fury!

Secret #7:

The access chamber with the Artefact of Regeneration. Opposite the rusty steel door 
you entered through, you should see bare gray brickwall. Push this portion of the 
wall to reveal another hidden cave with more treasure.


Challenge 2:
============

TOTAL SECRETS: 6


Secret #1:

In the small storage room near the start, where you can pick up ammo, and some treasure 
from under neonlights - one of the lights is out of service. Push this wall to find 
a hidden circular corridor with a plate of Lord's supper, a bottle of absinthe, and 
a glass full of absinthe. You can also find an Artefact of Salvation here.

Secret #2:

You must have found Secret area #1 to access this secret.
Push the wall portion with the non-functioning light again, and you can find a hidden 
chamber inside the circular corridor of Secret #1, containing two Artefacts of Life! 
You might have to push the wall twice, but it shall open. 
Note that it's extremely wise to grab these secrets early in the level - later, the 
passageway shall be promptly blocked, preventing you from snatching all the supplies 
here.

Secret #3:

This secret is found at the guard post near the mined passage - I set it up as a 
last chance in case you've failed to clean up the mines by the kind help of the Courb	
e Dominate initiates. Now then...enter the second guard post with the two marble 
tables, and check the left wall, opposite the torch. There is a tiny secret hole 
with a switch, controlling the fireball launcher blocking brickwall.

Secret #4:

The room of fissure gates. Instead of jumping through one of them, push the side 
wall next to the locked Blood door. This will reveal a hidden nook with the correct 
fissure gate.

Secret #5:

This one is not a real secret either, and is considered extemely important to finish 
this level once and for all. The south barrel room has a second rusty door, leading 
to a narrow zigzag corridor. At the end, you will see a blocking coloumn. Smash it 
down, and push the wall behind. Hence, you can enter back to the main hall of the 
level. This action, however, will permamently block the storage room, thus, making 
Secret area #1 and #2 impossible to reach. You were warned.

Secret #6:

The narrow, open alcove with the Gate key. It is STRONGLY recommended to obtain the 
Invulnerability and Fury Artefacts before opening this secret.
At the end of the long alcove, there is a lamp glowing on the brickwall. Push the 
wall to gain access to the outer area with the alarming number of Ultradrones and 
Unstoppables. Stab them to death until your Artefacts' power lasts, and then, poke 
around to see what you can grab from here. Behind the vines, there are a box of 12,6mm, 
some more 12,6mm bullets, a pile of 9mm bullets, rocket grenades, and an Artefact 
of Salvation inside the lair. At the end of this fenced-off area, two crowns, a SmartGun, 
and an Artefact of Life can be collected as well.


Challenge III
=============

TOTAL SECRETS: 12

Secret #1:

This secret area is at the third Challenge course. In the small room, where you can 
see the Suicide Drones running around behind the counter, turn to the right from 
the entry door, and push the wall. You will find a narrow hidden passageway with 
9mm bullet piles on your way. Eventually, a small tilewall hole you will arrive to 
- a 9mm clip, a bottle of absinthe, and a golden chalice is here.

Secret #2:

This secret area is at the third Challenge course. In the first Suicide Drone nook 
with the automatic door. Once you've took care of it, go back into his lair, and 
push the left wall which has a floral pattern on it. A narrow passage you will see, 
leading you to a small treasure chamber with mostly chalices and jewels.

Secret #3:

This secret area is at the third Challenge course. After the red stone circle with 
the coloumns. Head for the hallway decorated with coloumns. The first coloumn on 
the right can be knocked down. Do so, and also don't forget to push the wall behind. 
A small hidden area conceals four Lord suppers and two chalices.

Secret #4:

This secret area is at the second Challenge course. Near the second teleport pad 
(the one where you originally arrived to), there is a narrow pathway leading you 
to the great chamber. Enter this narrow pathway, and about halfway, push the wall 
on the left (not to the direction of the pentagram grates). Someone told me that 
the Courbée Dominate initiates  hide a bottle of fine absinthe there, and there are 
also rumors about a Savegame Artefact...

Secret #5:

This secret area is at the second Challenge course. The second teleport pad, just 
right from the wooden door. Follow the wall, and push the upper portion right in 
the corner. There is another room of supplies, with six plates of Lord supper, a 
bottle of absinthe, and a glass of absinthe.

Secret #6:

This secret area is at the first Challenge course. Exactly opposite the entrance, 
you can see a picture on the wall. Push it, and you can enter the sealed part of 
the library room. Look around - you can pick up a Crucifix, a box of jewels, a bottle 
of absinthe, and an Artefact of Salvation.

Secret #7:

This secret area is at the first Challenge course, and it's not a real secret alrighty, 
but  can help you BIG time. Near the fireball launcher, you'll see a wooden box in 
the wall. Push it in - there is a tiny room behind with a vial of holy water and 
a bag of gold. This little hidey hole will be valuable help once you let the big 
bad boys out...

Secret #8:

In the fireline of the first fireball launcher. Head towards the plant in the ceramic 
pot, while checking the right walls. There should be a hidden area, where you can 
pick up some gold, a glass of absinthe, and a vial of holy water.

Secret #9:

Also not a real secret. Near the wooden door, another crate is stuck at the corridor. 
Push it several times until you arrive to the tiny lounge with the piano. There - 
you have opened a quick escapeway, which you can use once you activate the fireball 
launcher.

Secret #10:

Does not count as a secret either, and is mandatory to complete the level. Push the 
wooden box away from the Tasoth's firing range at the Gold key.

Secret #11:

The final "does not count as a secret". Not far from the second fireball launcher, 
you will see another big crate. Try pushing it into the line of fire to obstruct 
the fireballs, and activate the switch, which moves the red stone wall away...

Secret #12:

If you complete the Challenge successfully, and leave via the elevator, you'll arrive 
to the third Super secret level - Mirror rooms.


			      +-------------------------+
			      | TRISTANIA3D EASTER EGGS |
			      +-------------------------+


 The traditional definition of an Easter Egg, like the ones that kids look for at 
Easter time, are little treasures that are valuable and surprise you when you find 
them. They don't have to be simply references to movies, games or otherwise, but 
neat things that you will be surprised upon viewing. Tristania3D also has some Easter 
Eggs hidden here and there - if you look for them eagerly, you shall eventually find 
them.

General Eggs:
=============

This very file is also an Easter Egg - whether you've find it by viewing the game 
mapfiles, or just dilly-dallying around with the data files - you have stumbled across 
this document. And if you have reached this part of the document, you might encourage 
reading it more.

During the game, if you stand still for 1 minute, Einar Moen will show something 
with his hand - and not the sign of peace.


1: Preludium
------------

¤ The background music for the level was also used in the very first level of the 
very first Doom - E1M1: Hangar (ID Software PC game), symbolizing that this is where 
it all begun, and there will be a lot to come. This is a direct reference for Doom, 
and the "great beginnings" style.

¤ The level title is a direct reference to the Tristania song with the same title.


2: Perimeter
------------

¤ There is a hidden text at the upper region of the map. If you open it with a map 
editor, you may see the message "Winners don't use maps!".

6: Dungeon
----------

¤ The level music is a direct reference for Spear Resurrection (a Wolfenstein 3-D 
sequel), where the dungeon level also has the same song.

7: The Gate
-----------

¤ If you open the game map file and search this level out, you will see a hidden message 
at the bottom of the level: "Looking for SECRETS? :P"

¤ The level title is a direct reference to the Tristania song with the same title.


8: Room of 4 keys
-----------------

¤ The level title is a direct reference for Spear: End of Destiny (a Wolfenstein 3-D 
sequel), where a level has almost the same name.

¤ If you open the game maps file, you will see a tag outside the level: "Lambda team 
2010"

19: Library wing
----------------

¤ The level title is a direct reference for Spear: End of Destiny, where a level has 
exactly the same name (it's the 18th level).

¤ The secret area with the many Black Apostles inside is also a direct reference to 
Wolfenstein 3-D. In the 2nd episode, there were a chain of secret areas, and at the 
end, the player arrived to a room full of SS.

20: Roundabout
--------------

¤ The level title is a direct reference for Spear: End of Destiny, where a level has 
exactly the same name, and it is also the 20th level.

21: Vibeke
----------

¤ The room behind the locked Gold doors are exactly the same which you have collected 
the Blood key from in level 10: Monastery.

¤ If you open the game maps file and hunt this level down, you'll stumble across a 
secret hint: "Diana loves you!"

25: Postludium
--------------

¤ The level title is a direct reference to the Tristania song with the same title.


26: Endgame
-----------

¤ If you open the game maps file and find this level, you will see a hidden message: 
"So you have reached the end of the game...hope you had fun! Lambda team."

Secret level 4: Goodbye Kitty!
------------------------------

¤ This whole level is one massive Easter Egg, referring to Hello Kitty, Sanrio's "invention" 
hated by so many people. The background music also reinforces this (The Vapors: Turning 
Japanese)

Super secret level 1: Greed
---------------------------

¤ If you could open the game maps file, you will discover a hidden message at the 
top of the level: "Are you Reactor or are you cheating?" Probably cheating :PPPPPPP


Super secret level 4: Hypercubed!!!
-----------------------------------

¤ The whole level is one big Easter Egg - a direct reference to the world-famous movie 
"Cube 2 - Hypercube"

¤ This game map also has a hidden message, if you can view it: "C'mon, quit cheating!"


Super secret level 5: Honour
----------------------------

¤ There is a hidden text on this level map saying "Fire in the hole!!!".

¤ The level title and the text is a direct reference to VNV Nation (a militarist band), 
and their music "Honour".

Unused level slot 54
--------------------

The 54th slot of the level list also contains a hidden message - this is how you 
found this document, I assume :P



   So there you have it, dear player. Your persistence of snooping around with the 
game files finally paid off - you have found this hidden little document, and could 
read everything about the hidden areas and the secrets of Tristania3D. Hope you are 
satisfied now! The least you could do is sendin' me an e-mail about "Thanks you, 
Reactor, for this cleverly hidden little surprise document!", I would be most pleased, 
after all these efforts :P
