			Back in the big room, but where is the General? Push the wall block for the bronze 
key, and the General himself. The missiles that flew your way previously came from 
(now dead) super officers that noticed you at the same time as the General.

			The bronze key will let you into rooms with powerups. But more enemies are now 
coming. Be on the move and fight for your life. Avoid the death chalices! There are 
no crosses on this floor.

			Finally defeated the General will leave you the gold key for the elevator. Shooting 
the barrels will put an end to the guard.
