Gates of hell

	Storyline:  BJ Blackowitz is finally dead and he went to hell.  Now to get out he 
must kill the grim reaper and have a second encounter with Satan on his home ground. 
 Pretty simple isn't it?  But quite literally the demons of hell are out to get you. 
and they like their hands bloody.
