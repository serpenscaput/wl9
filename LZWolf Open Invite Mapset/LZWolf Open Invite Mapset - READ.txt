LZWolf Open Invite Map Project
a compilation of LZWolf maps, spanning across
multiple online communities and 
officially endorsed by WOLFSOURCE,
the premier resource for all things Wolf3D!

This is a project made from the collaboration
of many people, in an effort to showcase the
versatibility and features provided
by LZWolf, a fork of Blzut3's ECWolf Engine
maintained by Linuxwolf.  

The levels contained in this mod vary radically,
from vanilla classic-style maps with cool new
actors, to intricate and stunning behemoths,
some with features such as parallax skies and
larger-than-64x maps.

This is built off of a toolkit, designed
by AstroCreep, that includes extra actors
and tiles already defined, and then was
distributed and used as a base to build
the submitted maps off of.

Base New Features:

4 keys
all static items from SOD and the Lost Missions
Static items and textures from Wolf Overdrive by Thomas Weiling
more textures from the Dunkel Collection
switch and remote door textures by Executor
An awesome animated menu backdrop (converted from a gif animation by AstroCreep)
an even more awesome new title sequence by Dunkelschwamm
Cool new IMF music, converted from midi by AstroCreep
	*songs by various, listed by map further on
A few new actors, such as new enemies and environmental hazards 	

All other new features vary by map
