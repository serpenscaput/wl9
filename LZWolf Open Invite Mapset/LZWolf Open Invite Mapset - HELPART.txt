^c00This is a community map project for LZWolf, designed to show off the different features and the versatility of the LZWolf source port.

^c00This uses LZWolf's ability to load different map translator files to create a completely customizable experience for each mapper - therefore each map is like a self contained mod.  Some are very decidedly vanilla, while others really push the limits of what LZWolf can do!
