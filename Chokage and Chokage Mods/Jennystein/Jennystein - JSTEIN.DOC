                            The Crowned King
                           ==================
   Long Ago
  ===========
 Many years ago there lived a Prince of Buckingham. He was but a young boy.
 He moarned for many months because he could not have a dog. His parents said
 the dog would chew everything up. He was destened to get a dog even after his 
 mother and father said no. As you can tell the Prince wouldn't take no for an
 answer. He kept trying to get a dog. He (after a long time of searching) 
 found a wee dog near an old beaten up house. He cried out in happiness, for 
 he had found the dog of his dreams. He knew he could never show his parents
 or he would never get to keep the dog. The dog had dark brown eyes, a pink
 nose and fur as blue as the sky. The Prince knew this was a gift from the 
 gods because no one had ever seen such a magnifisent thing, (back then). 
 He put it in his shirt and raced home. he knew his mother would become 
 suspicious the moment he walked in the door because the Prince was an hour
 late for supper and he would have to have a !DAM! good reason for it too.



   Posession Is At Risk
  ======================
 The Prince ran in the door like a bolt of lightning. He ran straight up to
 his room carful not to look his parents in the eye because then he would
 have to blurt out his secret. He was never very good at lying to his mother.   

 Every time she looked him in the eye his secret was doomed. If his mother
 ever found out he was lying to her he'd go straight to hell, "Right down the 
 elevater no stoppping no forgiveness is in store for you young man!",his mom
 would say. He got to his room and thought about a place where he could put 
 the pup. "In the closet, of coarse", he thought. He stuck the pup in the
 closet and went to find a small dish. He filled it up with water and made 
 his parents were no where in sight. He walked slowly up to his room careful
 not to spill the water.the pup began to slurp loadly as the Prince put down
 the dish. He kept the pup until it was three, that was the day the most 
 horrible thing happened. When the Prince brought the pups supper up he  
 noticed that he had fogoten to close the closet. He prayed that the dog was 
 still in the closet. He slowly walked towards the closet and peared inside.
 Nothing. Only the dogs water dish. He hoped he could find the dog before his  
 parents did. Too late. The Prince's mother and father knelt on the floor 
 praising the pup. It's eyes lite up with exitement. It stood up on it's hind
 legs.

  The Big Feast To The God's
 ============================
 And so the feast of praise to the God's began. There was many elegant meals
 to be served. The Prince told his parents the truth about the dog and they
 weren't the least bit angry, as a matter of fact they were happy. They 
 realised that the Prince cared so much for the dog he did not want to lose
 it. The Prince dedicated his life to the dog.Thirty years later he even   
 wrote a book about the dog.
   
  The Letter
 ============
 The God's have givin posesions of great worth the warrior dog helped us 
  fight many battles. He is truly Magic so we name him Nicodemus wich means 
 "Great Warrior." We shall never forget the gift from the great Gods. We
 shall forevor more worship  in honour of the God's. So we paint this picture
 of Nicodemus in magic so it may never be removed..................

  A Million Years Later (Now)
 =============================
 "Harry come on we've been digging for three hours and we haven't found any 
 gold. Let's come back tommorro okay it's late!"said Morty. "Just a few more
 minutes. I'm sure I'll find something. I have a feeling....
 Morty interupted him. "You always have a feeling Harry."said Morty. "But
 this time it's stronger. I mean it Morty."said Harry "Sure that's what you  
 said last time grrrrrrrrrrrr!"said Morty. "Morty, look at this wall." "Is
 this another one of your stupid tricks cause if it is I'm not turning 
 around, Harry." "Wow look at this painting Morty!!!" "Wow! We should turn
 this into a museum. Will be !RICH!!!"said Harry.
