Joe's Terror of Doom
----------------------

  Joel's tells us his tale of when HE was stuck in the terror of Doom:

      I started by the dungeons, the boss PatioMuscle locked me in the
    cell, I broke free with my Muscles...

      Mr. Blue was stand guard when he saw the cage broken. Then, I was
    behind him, he didn't see me, I grabbed his flower gun, he didn't notice,
    I 'bammed' him. I grabbed the Junior M-16, went to the door, got
    out....

      After batteling all his men, I seen THE KILLER "#33"
    going out of a locked door.... (the rest is for you to discover)




  Joe's Secret Hints:

    - Patiomuscle tries to lead you to death (him killing you) by dropping
      treasure for you in a line towards him. He gets real mad when you touch 
      his Crown.
    - Dogs can sometimes hide in the water and take over their fellow
      masters... they are very smart.
