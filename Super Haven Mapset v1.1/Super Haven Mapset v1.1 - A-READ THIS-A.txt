There is a suprise for those who find the most difficult secrets in each episode. 
The suprise is on each episode, and could 
be in any level of the episode. And on the first episode, there are two of the suprises. 
(Good luck finding either!)

What is the Super Haven Mapset?

For most Wolf3d Haven members, this is obvious, but not everyone is a Wolf3d Haven 
member. Well, quite a while ago (say,
two years ago) I started my first serious wolf3d map. I wanted to make a 60 level 
mapset called " Bones Alert ", admittingly
similar to the " Red Alert " wolf3d add-on. Since then, I realized there is no way 
I could have completed 60 levels. And
I saw the Haven Mapset, with only 20 levels, and thought --- well, "What better way 
to solve my problem then to make a new
version of the Mapset?" It would complete the Haven mapset, it would serve the mapset 
some dignity...I would finally
complete a whole 60 level mapset. 

Since my initial call for levels, many Forum Members have stepped up to complete 
the mapset. (Listed right after level list)
Well, I hope you enjoy the Super Haven Mapset --- the new, greater, version of the 
Haven Mapset. Cheers!

= Story =
=========
The story of the mapset is something I (Dark_wizzie) made up because I got bored. 
Please don't judge it. :(	
	You are BJ. Well, duh, who else can you be? Anyways....after Hitler died, his huge 
army of SS hid underground. 
That's why the US was able to destroy 'The Third Reich'. Or so they thought. No one 
suspected any army in
hiding. Well, after the time comes, they would start launching the new Reich: The 
Fourth Reich, started by some unknown 
character.

	
Episode 1: Teh Blastin' Fortress

	Anyways, you, BJ, is on a mission to find the purpose of this huge Nazi fortress 
near Hitler's Bunker. Or so, it was 
Planned. You were told to come back as soon as you find out. But you couldn't leave. 
As soon as you came in, you realized 
that you were followed. The mutants and guards sealed your entrance. You can actually 
see that on level 1. Turn around and 
see the sealed door. Only one way out. To go on top of this blasting fortress, come 
out alive, and climb down of the 
fortress. 
...Good Luck ^^

	
----


Episode 2: Mutant Knowledge

	Somehow, the mutants developed the ability to think. Already they are more powerful 
and fearsome than any normal
footsoldier. You must enter the Mutant Knowledge Development Center, aka MKDC. Start 
from a small isle that leads into a
fortress. This fortress guards many places, and one of them includes a secret sewer 
tunnel connection to the MKDC.
Don't let the world down! 


----


Episode 3: Sewer Unrest
	Sure, you took down the MKDC. Great job. But is this just the tip of the iceberg? 
Who started this facility? And
where are the mutants coming from? Schabbs is dead, but it seems as if nothing has 
changed. What is going on here? Unrest 
builds up again at the old Sewer Facility you already cleared...


----


Episode 4: Undieing
	Seems like Schabbs wasn't really quite dead. But that begs the question: How did 
he relive? Who is behind all of
this? How will you stop the creation of all mutants? After you climb out of the Sewers 
(Hellhole!), you quickly realize
that something is a wee bit off... The things don't add up... What is going on here?



----


Episode 5: Route of all Evil
	Far away in a remote island, there is a village mounting in steel blocks for no 
reason. Upon entering, you find out 
that there are mutants here. Could this place help explain how to stop all mutants?



----


Episode 6: Confrontation
	After finding out that the "island" is really a gigantic Nazi Base, you prepare 
to confront the undead General F.
again. There seems to be mounting resistance, though, and killing him this time is 
not quite as easy. You see, since the last
time he died, he had some time to think about how to place his guards to guard his 
whole base effectively. Good luck. And
it will be a Showdown, indeed.
