Items:

Some items were altered to give less score:

Cross: 50 points instead of 100.
Chalice: 250 points instead of 500.
Chest: 500 points instead of 1000.
Crown: 2500 points instead of 5000.

If you obtain 100% on any of the three bonus categories at the end of the level, 
you will win 5000 points instead of 10000, also the par-time reward has been reduced 
by half.

All of this was done to not get over a million points at the end of the episode.


And on a side note, the scientist gives you 300 points.


Known Bugs:

- After you finish an episode, you are still able to save the game, if you save and 
load, an strange thing will happen, this is not my fault, because it happens in the 
original Wolf4SDL.

- For some reason the game cannot be played properly on resolutions above 640x400 
(960x600, 1280x800, etc).
