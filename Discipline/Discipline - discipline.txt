Title                   : Discipline
Filename                : GAMEMAPS.WL6, MAPHEAD.WL6, VGAGRAPH.WL6
Release date            : 11/20/21
Authors                 : Executor and Thomas Weiling
Email Address           : spaceforce-temp@hotmail.com (Executor)
Other Files By Authors  : Too many to list
Misc. Author Info       : Two veteran Wolf3D mappers with numerous releases stretching
			  back to the early 2000s, including All This and Wolf3D (Thomas),
			  Operation Serpent (Executor), KowTow (Thomas), Coffee Break
			  Episodes 1 & 2 (Executor), and many more.

Description             : Vanilla-compatible replacement for the original Episode 5 of
			  Wolfenstein 3-D. Roughly follows the visual style and progression
			  of the original episode but is not a "literalist" homage like
			  W3DTWID, certain parts of Conflict in the Fatherland, etc.
			  Discipline is a difficult set and skill 4 is intended for veteran
			  Wolf3D players only. Others should consider playing on skill 3.

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : About 10 days
Editor(s) used          : MapEdit 8.4, WDC (for VGAGRAPH), SLADE3 (for ECWolf version)
Known Bugs              : It is theoretically possible to lure guards into areas where
			  they will attempt to shoot through barriers across floor codes,
			  but very unlikely. The 64 visible objects limit may strike when
			  playing E5M9 in the original DOS engine. The demos desync in
			  vanilla 1.4 and Wolf4SDL due to having been recorded in
			  Sam Dunne's WASD DOS build; there was no time for Thomas to
			  record replacements.
May Not Run With        : Vanilla Wolf3D versions earlier than 1.4
Tested With             : Wolf3D vanilla v1.4 (Apogee), Wolf3D vanilla v1.4
			  (GT/Activision), Sam Dunne's WASD build, ECWolf 1.3
