^C28 Doctor Schabbs 
 
^C00 You've done it, you've found the hidden operating rooms of the evil Doctor Schabbs! 
You've battled bravely to wipe out all of the mutant expirements to get to this point. 
This won't be easy but you know you must put an end to all this human experimentation 
once and for all! Time for a bit of retribution for all your fallen comrades.
