^C00 The start to your escape plan has worked! You seize the fallen guards gun and 
get ready to start finding your way out. You recall overhearing some of the guards 
speaking of a Doctor having operating rooms hidden somewhere within the castle. You 
must do whatever it takes to stay alive as well as wipe out the evil experiments 
being performed within the castle's walls.
