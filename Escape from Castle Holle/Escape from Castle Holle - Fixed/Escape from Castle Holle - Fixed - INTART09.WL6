^C28 Franz Schmidt
 
^C00 Having escaped the prison levels of the Castle you have now come across the 
last step to working your way into other areas of the castle. The Gatekeeper 'Franz 
Schmidt' stands is hidden away waiting for anyone not in an German uniform. He has 
a loud booming warning that can be heard from a distance away. this voice alone has 
been none to scare people off by itself. Good luck!
