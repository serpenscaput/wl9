'Damn,Beatrice sent us on another suicide mission.But this time it had to do with 
aliens,ALIENS!!
 If i thought of some excuse to not go but my stupidty was much,So here i am stuck 
here in the coldest
 Region,Antartica.4 guards asked for me and my teams I.D,We pulled our wallets,They 
let us pass.But 
 something caught my eyes when looked at the guards,Fear in there eyes.But i
 ignored it(Which i should not of).My mission,A search and Rescue find 
 Ardath Von Krell,Ardath is Swedish,I must find him before it is to late,
 And i must watch my team just in case if the get infected by TheThing.Barrett
 yells at me and he spots a figure 2km away from us were gonna check out.Wish me 
luck.
