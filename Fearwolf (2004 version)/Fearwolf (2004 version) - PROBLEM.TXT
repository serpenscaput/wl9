Wolfenstein 3D Fear of Vengance final version.

I have been getting some emails about fearwolf.exe is crashing, i have tested
it under W95, W98, W98-SE, W-ME, with no problems. I have only hexedited the
fearwolf.exe file to to add some new text. If anyone can come up with a
plausible explanation on why it crashes you're welcome. If it crashes just run
the game with the usual wolf3d.exe.
