                         Dr Schabbs and the fat cat.

What you didn't know about doctor Schabbs is that he is a great cat lover, so
he decided to send out his troops to kidnap general Mowser's fat cat. They did
succeed in doing so, the hungry and very loud meows from the cat are rumoured 
to come from the giant secret maze. If you rescue the fat cat, general Mowser
have promised you a kitten. (the beasts are eating him out of the house).
Good luck.
