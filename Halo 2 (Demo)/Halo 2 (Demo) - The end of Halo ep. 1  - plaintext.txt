The End Of Halo

You run to the last escape pod left on the floor and grab a frightened marine and 
throw him in.  The pilot says, "Buckle up!" and the pod shoots out of the Pillar 
of Autumn at incredible speed.  Cortana talks to you a while before she notices the 
Autumn accelerating.  "Look she says.  "The Pillar of Autumn is accelerating... Captain 
Keys is going in on his own." You look over at the back window and watch the Autumn 
go down.  Then the escape pod starts to descend into the ring's atmosphere. Cortana 
says, "If I had fingers they would still be crossed."  The pod starts to shake and 
lose control.  The pilot is having a hard time then it crashes on the ringâ€¦  You 
wake up to find all the marines dead and a group of covenant soldiers coming your 
way.
