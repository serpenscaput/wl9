Story:
*****************************************************************************
  Despite Adolf Hitler's downfall, several groups of surviving Nazis refused
to give in, and so started wars of their own.  Many are worried, because,
rumours are, a revolutionary new crystal has been discovered, called the
Omega Crystal. If refined correctly, it provides virtually limitless energy,
but also provides massive explosive power - and the Nazis intend to use it
for its second use!!!

  The Grosse and Giftmacher family are believed to be involved.  However, the
supreme leader is believed to be Martin Bormann, Hitler's fixer.  But he
commited suicide, didn't he?  Or did he somehow cheat or fake death.

Levels:
*****************************************************************************
TIP:
  Some of the descriptions deliberately give away some of the levels'
  content - read on for more secret intelligence!!

Episode 1.

  Episode 1 is not currently ready.  My sister (Jennifer) is creating most
  of the levels for this episode.

Episode 2.

  With the map of the Nazi fortresses and the plans for the Omega Crystals,
  you are parachuted into the specified compound...

Level 1 - Perimeter

        Locate the Jewelled-Bronze Key to open the door to the entrance of
        the castle.

Level 2 - Entrance Hall

        You're inside the castle, but the elevator that leads to the upper
        floor has a safety lock on it.  Locate its silver key.

Level 3 - Corridor

        Deeper inside!  A massive corridor is split into several segments,
        but you can't get cross the segments directly, work your way through
        the corridor - the long way!

Level 4 - Officers' Club

        Assassinate the Officers that give this floor its name.  Only then
        will the armies fall apart.

Level 5 - Treasury

        Kill the three Guardians that hang on to the keys; then, if you feel
        like an evil mercenary, raid the treasuries!

Level 6 - Pursuit

        This cave is a practice site and shooting range for Officers and SSs.
        Can you get to the exit elevator before they get you?  What a
        headache!

Level 7 - Amazing!

        The exit is straight in front of you, but is blockaded.  Work your
        way through the maze of corridors to get to it from behind.  This
        floor, however, has another reason why it's called 'Amazing!'

Level 8 - Gatekeepers

        The elevator stops one floor short of the mines.  More elevators lie
        nearby, that WILL lead to the mines, but they require three keys to
        activate, which are held by three guardians.  Will the shortage of
        ammo hold you back?

Level 9 - Mining Ops

        At last!  The mines!  Dozens of raw Omega Crystals jut out from all
        directions.  The steel mining machines are scattered around
        everywhere, drilling holes through the mine walls, digging for Omega
        Crystals.  The Nazi Remnants and Followers (as they call themselves)
	would usually use the freight lift to get down here, but that's in
	another part of the mines behind sealed doors.  Kill the guardian
	that wields the key to the main mining area, and then assassinate
	Martin Bormann, the organiser of this outrage!  Good luck!

        TIP:

        If you do happen to find the freight lift (it has a long wall of
        rails, and is filled with drums of refined Omega Crystal and two of
        the mining machines) you will be rewarded!

 Secret - Madness!

        If you happen to find this level, collect as much as you can before
        the SSs and the 'unexpected strangers' get rid of you!

        TIP:

        There is a giveaway pattern in which doors can and can not be opened
        by the gold key. You just have to be observant.

Episode 3.

  With Martin Bormann assassinated, the Nazi Remnants and Followers are now
scattered in disarray... except... one last group, who withhold tonnes of
Omega Crystal, and have a Omega Refinery somewhere in their compound.  Also,
they are now experimenting with their eternal power.  Combined with Schabbs's
research and technology, they have already worked out how to make mutants and
summon Hitler Ghosts with it - be warned, they have also created three
UberMutants; and their numbers may increase quickly.  Stop them before it's
too late!

Level 1 - Vehicle Depot

        This is where the Omega Crystals are transported.  Kill the Officers
        and SSs located in this area.

Level 2 - Steel Temple

        This is the nickname for a security system built around a maze of
        steel passages and doors, and well-hidden keys.

Level 3 - Prison Complex

        Many unfortunate prisoners-of-war were transported here to be
        transformed into mutants.  No mutants lurk around here, however;
        they have already been moved to the laboratories elsewhere.
        Nevertheless, getting through will be a challenge, especially with
        a Guardian holding the Gold Key to the exit.

Level 4 - Armoury

        This dark and gloomy floor holds ammunition and guns for mutants to
        have attached to their chests.  Be warned, a number of prepared
        mutants guard the armoury, and the first UberMutant!!!

Level 5 - Barracks

        Because of the secrecy of the Omega Crystals and their refining, many
        of the workers and guards have to actually live in the fortress.
        Expect heavy resistance!

Level 6 - Treasury II

        This is the fortress's treasury, containing all the money they need
        for the Omega Crystal project.  Just be careful - the route out of
        the treasury is locked and the necessary keys are hidden in the
        treasury itself.  Note, most of the treasure stored here has already
        been spent or transported elsewhere, but some small stockpiles and
	loose items still remain.

	NOTE:

	It is extremely difficult to gain the 100% Treasure Ratio on this
	floor, but it's possible.

Level 7 - Omega Refinery

        This is the place where the Raw Omega Crystals are refined down to
        their hyper-explosive state.  Mutants are everywhere, but the biggest
        risk is when you have to shut down the kiln - the shut off switch is
        actually IN the kiln, so you will have to enter it while it's red hot!

Level 8 - Laboratories

        This is the heart of the Omega Crystal experimentation. Guards are
        everywhere, determined not to let you into the main laboratory (where
        their latest creations await, including the second UberMutant), OR
        onto the next floor where their BIGGEST creation awaits, bigger than
        their current ones...

Level 9 - ESCAPE!

        Well, you made it onto the next floor, but their 'biggest' creation
        was not what you expected.  It is a massive 'super-bomb'.  Packed
        with several tonnes of refined Omega Crystals, it has enough explosive
        power to destroy the whole of Europe - and it is making very unusual
        sounds!  The Nazi Remnants and Followers are so determined now that
        they are willing to make the ULTIMATE sacrifice... to destroy their
        country do destroy Europe!  Locate and disarm the bomb before its
        timer reaches zero.

        TIP:

          You may find a few scattered mutants and 'creations' along the
          way... and... if you're unlucky... the final UberMutant!  If you do
          locate and kill the UberMutant however, all the doors in the maze
          will be unlocked, making it much easier to get through (and
          revealing more rewards!)

        We salute you... well, we will if we still exist after you go in!

Secret - "Undeadly!"

        The name says it all.  This level has mutants!  There is plenty of
        reward if you find this level, but you have to locate the Jewelled
        Bronze Key and take the gold and silver keys away from the two
        Guardians which appear somewhere in this secret storage facility.

        TIP:

        Acquiring the keys is difficult, especially on the highest difficulty
        rating, "I am Death Incarnate", but a secret, not too deep into the
        level, does contain copies of all three keys.

*****************************************************************************
Enemies:
*****************************************************************************
        Guard (Brown Soldier)
                Simple soldier.  Slow firing, slow moving, and slow drawing;
                but he can pack a punch if you're caught off-guard.

                Worth 100 points

        Guard Dog
                Weak, but fast, and good at avoiding your shots.  Its bite is
                worse than its bark!

                Worth 200 points

        Officer (White Soldier)
                Very fast moving, good at strafing, and very fast with
                drawing his gun.

                Worth 400 points

        SS (Blue Soldier)
                A Nazi êlite troop!  Tough with a devastating machine gun,
                Yet he does drop it when killed.

                Worth 500 points

        Mutant (Green Soldier)
                Slow, but doesn't have to draw its gun, because it is already
                drawn - connected to its chest - and it is very rapid firing;
                worse still, it moves silently, so you won't know if its seen
                or heard you.

                Worth 700 points

        Hitler Ghost
                Mysterious spirits which love to pump fast-moving fireballs
                into your face!

                Worth 2,000 points

        Blue Guardian (Hans Grosse relative)
                Well armoured, with two nasty chainguns!  Drops the gold key
                when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        Red Guardian (Gretel Grosse relative)
                Similar to the Blue Guardian, but she prefers two large
                shotguns instead of two chainguns.  But they do pack a punch,
                even at long range.  She drops the silver key when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        White Guardian (Otto Giftmacher relative)
                Large guy with a rocket launcher! Enough said?  Drops the
                jewelled bronze key when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        Ubermutant (Large Green Guardian with four arms and chest chaingun!)
                What gets most people is its terrifying appearance - then,
                once it catches you off-guard, it minces you with its chest
                chaingun! Drops the jewelled bronze key when killed.

                Worth 5,000 points

        Martin Bormann
                The boss at the end of Episode 2.  Armed with a rocket
                launcher and a chaingun, this fatso is sure to make a pool
                of blood out of you!

                Worth 5,000 points

*****************************************************************************
Locked Doors:
*****************************************************************************
       Locked doors are grey, steel plated doors with a keyhole in the
       centre.  You require a key (which is located elsewhere in the same
       level) to open it.  Guards, however, can open these doors at anytime;
       and if you are skilled enough, kill a guard while he is in the doorway,
       and the door will be jammed open.  Bingo!  You got through without the
       key!

       NOTE:
         Guards can also open the locked door which cannot be opened by any
       key.  One particular level uses this trick, and if you pull it off,
       you are rewarded with tonnes of treasure and 1UPs!  Also note, Dogs
       and Hitler Ghosts cannot open doors.

*****************************************************************************
Mechanical Doors:
*****************************************************************************
       A mechanical door is nothing more than a plain steel plate with no
       handle or lock on it.  To open them, you must locate a switch with its
       handle in the "up" position (the switch in the entry elevator doesn't
       count!)  Some doors start initially open, and others initially closed.
       Flipping the switch will toggle these doors so the ones that were
       closed are now open, and vice versa.  Note that neither the player nor
       enemies can open or close these doors in any other way.

*****************************************************************************
"End of Level" Bonuses:
*****************************************************************************
       TIP:  If you prove yourself superior and scour the floors undefeated,
             you may be rewarded the secret bonus!

                Locked Door (Opened by Jewelled bronze key)
                Locked Door (Can never be opened by player, because it has no

                  doors, but with a reactor-wall texture)

            secret bonus yourself!

	    "ENDGAME" Floor-code trigger adapted so it ends the level with an
	    open door sound (because they are placed in front of doors, to

	    sector) rather than ending the episode if the current floor is
            NOT 9 or 10.
