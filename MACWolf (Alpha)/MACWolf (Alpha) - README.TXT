Macwolf - a project started by Jimmy Cozad

Here's the alpha version of my first tc called macwolf - it's going to be a complete 
clone of the original mac version, apart from the levels which at present are from 
the addon WolfBel2 (these may be changed later). Many of the actors (sprites and 
sounds) have been replaced with those from the mac version.

For copyright reasons, the original 60 levels and the 2 audio files have not been 
included.

To Install: Extract the files to a new folder and then add the 2 audio files (audiohed.wl6 
and audiot.wl6) from a full PC version of Wolfenstein3D v1.4. 

The project needs help from mac users with the following:
only from the original version on mac: 
*flamethrower and rocket launcher

Fixes for the following: 
*BJ status bar face
*Ubermutant mac sprites - for right now his chaingun shoots rockets (needs to be 
fixed to shoot bullets)

More animation for the following: 
*Deathnight 
*shooting Hitler bloody death

Other things to do:
*replace music with mac music
*episodes and difficulty icons to be replaced
*some soundfx needs replacing
*textures need sharpening
*readme to give credits where they are due

Existing credits - thanks to: 
*Mr Lowe's for the BJ that is used in the status bar
*id software
