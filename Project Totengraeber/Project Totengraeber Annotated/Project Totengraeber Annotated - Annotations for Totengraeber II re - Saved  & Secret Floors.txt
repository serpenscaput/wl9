Re: Saved & Secret Floors:

Wolfenstein 3D is always more challenging when the game isn't
saved until the next floor is reached, but it's unrealistic to risk losing 
maximum health, ammunition, and the chain gun on a floor where 
it's impossible to advance with only the pistol and eight rounds.

By using the Saved & Secret Floors folders, you can chose to:

a) Start on any floor from 7-13, with a perfect score to date, or

b) Start on any floor from 18-41, with a 100% kill score to date, or

c) Practice any floor from 7-13, 18-41, or any of the secret floors, in
     advance of actual play, or

d) Set the goal of each floor as reaching the next floor elevator, 
     without regard for health, ammo or weapon status. If you 
     successfully reach the next floor elevator, begin the new floor
     with maximum health, ammo, and chain gun by using the 
     appropriate saved game file. This saves you hours of pressing
     the space bar around the perimeter, looking for secrets and
     treasure. 

How to use the saved game folders:

Copy the contents of any ONE saved  or secret floors folder
to the main folder of Totengraeber II. In the game menu, select
Load Game. Each saved game or secret floor is described.

Notes: Use copy/paste for the saved and secret floors, 
rather than cut/paste, or you risk losing the saved game or
secret floor files.

If you have any saved game scenarios that you want to keep, 
cut/paste them to a new folder in the main Totengraeber II folder 
before copying saved or secret floors, or the new files will overwrite
the old. 

I registered 100% kill on all floors. I had 100% secrets and treasures
on most, but not all. If you start from floor 13, you can acheive a perfect score.

If you start from floor 18, you can beat my high score. Select View Scores to
see my high score with and without the Super Secret level.

Good luck, BJ!
