=================== PROJECT TOTENGRAEBER ===================
                                                     PHASE 1

One Evil Nazi Scheme. One Momentous Mission. One Last Chance
                     to Save Humanity.

      ¯¯ A Wolfenstein 3-D Campaign by B.J. Rowan ®®
------------------------------------------------------------


== THE STORY ===============================================

      It is 1942, at the height of the Second World War, and
the  Allies  are fighting a fierce battle against  the  Axis
Powers  in  Europe, and the conflict looks  far  from  over.
Worse, the Allies have reason to believe that the Nazis  may
be  amassing a new army of undead soldiers to do battle  for
them.  It  is  rumored that a top Nazi scientist,  one  Arzt
Schabbs  (generally considered mad by his former colleagues)
has  found a way to resurrect soldiers who have been  killed
in  battle,  graft a third arm onto their chests,  and  send
them back to the front lines - in a macabre experiment known
as "Project Totengraeber" (effectively, "Gravedigger"). Some
such  undead  soldiers may even receive special conditioning
to carry out suicide missions no sane man would ever accept.
With  no  concern  for  their  own  lives,  only  a  bitter,
ingrained  desire  to  kill,  Schabbs'  zombies  would  have
nothing  to lose in a firefight, attacking relentlessly  and
with  unimaginable determination. This appalling possibility
leaves   some   in   the   Allied  military   aghast,   some
disbelieving, and all horrified. But the prospect seems very
real,  and if it does turn out to be true, this new army  of
undead  warriors could spell doom for the  Allies  -  as  it
effectively  means the Nazis would have an unlimited  supply
of  soldiers for battle. Death on the battlefield no  longer
spells  the  end  for  those  subjected  to  Schabb's  lurid
experiments. And unless Schabbs and his army are eliminated,
the  war  could begin to take a terrible turn for the  worse
for the Allies - and indeed, for humanity itself.

      There  are  other rumors afoot as well amongst  Allied
Intelligence  officers. Recon teams coming  back  from  top-
secret missions deep within enemy territory have reported  a
suspicious amassing of soldiers and top Nazi generals  in  a
localized  area  of  Nazi Germany. This mountainous  region,
home  to  several  ancient  German castles,  was  originally
thought to hold no strategic importance, but apparently  the
Nazis  have some sort of secret operation underway  in  that
sector.  Could  it  be  related to the rumored  Totengraeber
project?  Could the execution of a massive new Nazi campaign
be imminent?

       Desperately   seeking   a  means   to   combat   this
potentiality, Allied Intelligence has brought to  the  table
several recently-acquired maps showing the locations of  six
German   castles  in  this  questionable  region   of   Nazi
territory, each of which is suspected to play a key role  in
the mysterious Totengraeber project. The Allies believe that
a  concise plan of systematic elimination of these key  Nazi
installations, including Arzt Schabbs and his  undead  army,
is  an  immediate necessity. According to Intelligence,  the
six  castles are interconnected via a system of old tunnels,
which  can  also serve as bomb shelters - and, depending  on
their  magnitude,  possibly one or more  secret  bunkers  or
laboratories. The tunnels were constructed around  the  time
of  the  first  World War, and now the Nazis are  apparently
using  them  as a secret transportation route between  their
key  bases  of  operations.  They are,  however,  relatively
lightly guarded at one particular position. Considering this
position  a  perfect "back door" by which a  one-man  strike
force  might gain access to the castles and destroy  Project
Totengraeber  from  the inside out,  the  Allies  decide  to
recruit  their most effective one-man strike force  for  the
job - a man by the name of Captain William J. Blazkowicz, or
"B.J." to his friends.

      You  are B.J. Blazkowicz, and your commanding officers
are  sending you deep into the heart of Nazi Germany to stop
Project  Totengraeber  if it exists.  Castle  Sturmwind,  an
ancient Prussian castle in the southwest area of the  target
region,  is lightly guarded and has been designated as  your
entry  point. You will enter the castle's ground level,  and
work  your way down through the cellars to the tunnel system
beneath.  From  there,  follow  the  tunnels  as  they  wind
northeastward. The tunnels apparently connect with the lower
levels  of  several other castles, and you will most  likely
find it necessary to work your way through those floors  and
back  into  the  tunnels  at  some  other  location.  Allied
Intelligence  believes the tunnels will  eventually  end  up
beneath Castle Dolchteufel, where it is believed the  entire
Totengraeber project is being spearheaded. Along the way you
may  find yourself caught up in head-to-head firefights with
the   high-ranking  Nazi  generals  who  are  in  the  area,
evidently  overseeing  the final  stages  of  the  project's
execution.  Your  orders  are  to  eliminate  as  much  Nazi
resistance  as you see fit, but remember that  your  primary
objective  is  the  assassination of Arzt  Schabbs  and  his
legion of mutated walking dead. Schabbs may be holed up in a
secret  lab  in  Castle Dolchteufel, at the  center  of  the
secret tunnel system. You must take him and his army out  at
all  costs.  This is your toughest assignment yet,  and  you
will be up against some of Hitler's finest. There's lots  of
ground  to  cover out there, so fight hard, keep  your  wits
about you, and remember to make use of the Nazis' health and
munitions to keep you going. The Allies are counting on you,
B.J. Go win one for humanity...and try to come back alive!


== SETTING UP PROJECT TOTENGRAEBER =========================

      Setting up Project Totengraeber is simple. Just  unzip
the package into a new directory; no original game files are
required. You can even unzip Project Totengraeber into  your
WOLF3D  directory; none of your original game files will  be
overwritten   or  modified  in  ny  way.  To  play   Project
Totengraeber, run the file TOTEN.EXE by typing its  name  at
the  command line and pressing Enter. Select "New Game" from
the  main menu, choose your preferred difficulty level  from
the following screen, and your mission begins!


== FEATURES ================================================

     Wolfenstein 3D: Project Totengraeber is one of a brand-
new  generation of Wolf3D add-ons. Since the release of  the
game's  source  code, designing only new level  packages  no
longer  seemed to be enough for me, and many other designers
as  well. As a result, Project Totengraeber has several  new
features in the game engine, many of which are concepts made
popular   by   Gary   Ragland,  with   his   excellent   and
revolutionary  Wolfenstein add-ons Assassinate  Hitler!  and
Schabbs 2000. Project Totengraeber features:

* 47 brand new levels (27 in Phase 1, 20 in Phase 2)
* New art and sound effects from various sources and  my
   own design
* One massive episode with seamless level flow
* Changed ceiling colors
* Changed music order (and addition of several Spear  of
   Destiny selections)
* Two new keys (the bronze key and the elevator keycard)
   with icons on the status bar
* Chainguns that occasionally jam, requiring you to find
   a new one
* Non game-terminating bosses

      The game's 47 levels, instead of being arranged in six
10-level  episodes, are laid out as one continuous  mission,
consisting of several groups or "units" with a common theme.
For  instance, the first few levels are of Castle  Sturmwind
and its lower levels, your point of entry to the underground
tunnel   system.   Further  levels   consist   of   cellars,
laboratories,  and  offices of  the  other  various  castles
connected by the tunnels. The last few levels are of  Castle
Dolchteufel   and   its  underground   bunker,   the   final
installation  in the Totengraeber plot, where  Arzt  Schabbs
himself  is overseeing the entire experiment. Find  his  lab
deep within the Dolchteufel bunker and take him out, and any
of his zombie soldiers along with him!


== NEW KEYS ================================================

      Project Totengraeber features two new keys for you  to
find, in addition to the standard gold and silver keys.  The
two  new keys won't be used on the earlier levels, but later
on,  as  the game gets harder, you may need to find  one  or
even both of them as well to get out of the level.

The Bronze Key is usually used to hide super-secret areas or
the  elevator to a secret level. If you open a pushwall  and
find  a  locked door that won't open, even though  you  have
both  the  gold  and silver keys, there is likely  something
very  special  behind  that door! The bronze  key  is  quite
difficult to find, and is usually kept in a secret  area  of
its  own. In the depths of Schabbs' secret bunker,  you  may
need this key just to escape to the next floor.

The  Elevator  Key is a special keycard used to  unlock  the
elevator door itself. You will not always need this key.  On
higher levels, the private elevator to the next floor may be
secured and you will need this keycard to gain access to it.
Sometimes  you  will run into one of Hitler's Generals,  who
will  be carrying the keycard himself! You will have to kill
him  to get the card and proceed to the next floor. You  can
easily recognize elevator doors locked by the elevator  key,
as  they  will have a yellow knob on them and  a  card  slot
directly beneath it.


== YOUR MISSION ============================================

      Project Totengraeber's 47 levels are divided  up  into
"sections", each in a different location with its own theme.
The level progression is as follows:

-- PHASE 1 -------------------------------------------------

Levels 1, 2: Sewer Entrance
You  enter Castle Sturmwind via an underground sewer system.
This  sewer system hasn't been used in a long time, and  the
Nazis  have  converted it to a series of tunnels  that  lead
upwards  into  the lower levels of Castle Sturmwind.  It  is
only lightly guarded and an easily penetrated weakness.

Levels 3-5: Castle Sturmwind
The  lower  levels of this castle need to  be  traversed  in
order for you to gain access to the underground tunnels that
connect the rest of the castles involved in Schabbs' private
experiment.

Level 6: Tunnel 1

Levels 7-11: Castle Shattenspender
The  first tunnel dead-ends here, in the dungeons of  Castle
Shattenspender.  You'll need to work your way  through  five
floors  of the castle to reach the secret elevator providing
access to the next tunnel.

Level 12: Tunnel 2

Levels 13-18: Castle Daemmerung
This castle is old and hasn't been inhabited in decades.  It
has   since  been  turned  into  a  Nazi  storage  facility,
primarily  for  equipment pertaining  to  the  Nazi  medical
experiments.  Rumors tell of a secret medical  lab  area  in
this   castle  which  was  used  at  the  onset  of  Project
Totengraeber,  but has since been abandoned.  Be  careful  -
some  early versions of Schabbs' experiments may  have  been
abandoned with it!

Level 19: Tunnel 3

Levels 20-24: Castle Eisenschwert
An  official Nazi stronghold, Castle Eisenschwert is  now  a
waypoint  for operations pertaining to Project Totengraeber.
High-ranking officers and SS inhabit its walls.

-- PHASE 2 (Coming Soon) -----------------------------------

Level 25: Tunnel 4

Levels 26-29: Castle Hollenhammer
Arzt  Schabbs' former post, this is now an abandoned  castle
built on the side of a mountain high in Nazi Germany. You'll
have  to make your way through its cold, dark floors to  get
to  the entrance to the tunnels on the other side. God  only
know what lurks in the depths of this place.

Level 30: Tunnel 5

Levels 31-33: Castle Dolchteufel
This  is  the  place the Allies believe  is  the  center  of
operations for Project Totengraeber. If reports are correct,
there will be a serious amassing of troops at this location.
Somewhere  in  the depths of the castle is the  entrance  to
Schabbs'  secret  bunker, where all of his  experiments  are
being performed.

Levels 34-39: The Bunker
Arzt   Schabbs'   secret  bunker  resides   beneath   Castle
Dolchteufel.  You  will need to traverse several  floors  of
laboratories,  medical  areas, and offices.  At  the  bottom
level of the bunker is Schabbs' private office.

Level 40: Arzt Schabbs' Private Office Level
This  is  it  -  you've  got a confrontation  in  store  for
Schabbs, that monstrocity. You'll need to use all your  wits
and  firepower to send him and his mutant army on an express
elevator to hell, right where they belong!

Level 41: Castle Dolchteufel Executive Level
At  the  bottom  of Schabbs' titanic bunker is  an  elevator
shaft   leading  up  to  the  executive  level   of   Castle
Dolchteufel. You will need to use this elevator to escape to
the surface and wait for Allied air support to come pick you
up. Be careful, Blazkowicz - this is one of the most heavily-
guarded  castles in Nazi Germany, and you may  yet  have  to
deal  with some serious resistance. If you can make  it  out
alive, you'll have won, and the free world will be saved!

-- SECRET LEVELS -------------------------------------------

Levels 42-47: Secret Levels
These  secret areas are accessed from various floors of  the
many  castles you will explore. They are always hidden. Some
are  kept under lock and key. You'll need to do some serious
searching  to find the secret elevators in any case.  Secret
levels  are  prime  areas for storage  of  stolen  gold  and
treasure,  so if you can find them, your score is likely  to
increase  by  a  sizeable amount! But be  careful  -  secret
levels  may  also be heavily guarded! There are some  secret
levels in Phase 1...can you find them?

Super-Secret Level(tm) (Phase 2)
Somewhere  in  the  depths of one of the  castles  you  will
encounter  is the elevator to a fabled Super-Secret  LevelT,
home   to  much  mystery  and  excitement  (not  to  mention
treasure).  When  you  find its dark and  secluded  elevator
shaft,  you'll be taken to the roof of the castle  for  some
super  extra  rewardness!  Only  the  most  adventurous   of
adventurers  will  find the Super-Secret  LevelT.  You  must
think  to look where one would never expect to find a secret
elevator...


== DEVELOPER'S NOTES =======================================

The following is a section for you other source code hackers
out  there, or people who are just curious as to  what  I've
done  to  the  source code in this, my latest project.  I've
tried  to make as complete a list as possible of the changes
I've made, plus any bugs that may still exist.

-- Itemized EXE Alterations --------------------------------

* Episode structure removed. gamestate.episode is always
   0,  as it is in Spear. Episode select screen removed; game
   goes right to difficulty select screen when you choose "New
   Game".
* Seamless level flow through all 60 levels, with  floor
   number  reporting  correctly on  the  status  bar.  Ratios
   reported at the end of each level.
* Secret  level  handling written as  it  is  in  Spear.
   Specific cases written for level intermission; if the player
   exited via a secret elevator, and the mapon value is one of
   a few certain values, game will proceed to the appropriate
   secret  floor, and return to the appropriate level.  After
   each secret floor, custom intermission screens will appear
   (like  in Spear), reporting what type of area you've  just
   completed.
* Bosses no longer end the game when killed. In addition,
   they drop Key #4, the Elevator Key.
* Maximum ammo capacity is now 150. Ammo count displays 3
   digits properly and in the correct place on the status bar.
   A slight adjustment of the digits' offset (of about 4 pixels
   to the left) was required.
* Maximum health is now 200%, but can only be raised over
   100%  by  a 1-Up (Adrenaline Health Kit). If the  player's
   health is less than or equal to 100%, getting a 1-Up  will
   bring  their health to 125%. Additional 1-Ups  will  raise
   health in 25% increments until 200% is reached.
* When the player's health is 10% or less, the sound  of
   B.J.'s heart beating is heard, adding to the suspense.
* In addition to slurping blood up off the floor when the
   player's health is 10% or less, the player can also  drink
   the water puddles when his/her health is below 20%. Drinking
   water gives a health increase of 2%.
* Ceiling  colors changed on each level to  reflect  the
   theme and style of the floor, match the wall textures, etc.
* Music changed on each level to reflect the theme of the
   floor (suspense, action, etc.).
* New  keys  added: bo_key3 and bo_key4, the Bronze  and
   Elevator keys, respectively, with new status bar icons. Top
   right = Bronze key, bottom right = Elevator key.
* Locked  Door type 4 (dr_lock4) points to  a  different
   wall tile than the standard locked door. This is achieved by
   supplying  a  DOORWALL value of -74, which points  to  the
   "Level  Entrance"  wall texture, not being  used  in  this
   project.
* New  Door added. Now there are two different kinds  of
   unlocked doors: the regular steel door, and a rusty version
   of the regular door.
* New item added: Ammo box. Graphics are from Spear. When
   the  ammo box is picked up, a new FM synth sound  will  be
   heard and the player's ammo count will be increased by  16
   bullets.
* New item added: Adrenaline Hypo. Gives you a 2% health
   boost,  up  to  a maximum of 200%. Besides the  Adrenaline
   Health  Kit, these are the only health power-ups that  can
   boost your health past 100%.
* New  item  added:  Adrenaline  Health  Kit.  This  kit
   contains  an experimental dosage of adrenaline  and  other
   pharmaceuticals which give you an instant health boost  to
   125%, or 25% additional if you are already above 100%. They
   also give you an extra life.
* Coming soon in Phase 2: On floors 34-37, you'll hear
   some ambient sounds playing every once in a while -- sounds
   like tortured screams and metal gurneys being dragged across
   the floor. These floors are Schabbs' secret laboratories,
   and the sounds are put in to enhance the atmosphere.

-- New Cheats / Debug Keys ---------------------------------

* "B"+"A"+"T" code now displays version/build information
   screen.
* Secret  Cheat  "M"+"L"+"I"  disabled,  replaced  with
   "P"+"L"+"E" (my wife's nickname), which will  give  you
   200%  health and 150 bullets. NO keys are added. Score  is
   zeroed and time increased as before. Last-chance emergency
   code only.
* Activating debug mode: The command-line parameter  and
   key  combo  to activate debug mode have changed  to  defer
   casual cheaters. However, if you're stuck or want to check
   out  some of the other floors, type the following  at  the
   command  line to activate Project Totengraeber with  debug
   mode enabled: toten nantana. Alternatively, you can run the
   file CHEATS.BAT to do this automatically. When you get into
   a game, press and hold LSHIFT + HOME + BACKSPACE to activate
   debug keys. TAKE NOTE: Once you activate debug keys,  your
   score  will no longer increase, not even for bonuses after
   secret levels, or when you press Tab+I. This is to prevent
   cheaters or casual players from getting a high score.
* Debug mode code "Tab"+"K" added, which gives you all 4
   keys (with the keyup sound).
* Debug mode code "Tab"+"E" (end current level) removed.
* Debug mode code "Tab"+"W" (warp to level) will not let
   you access the secret levels, or any level slots higher than
   those covered in Phase 1. You'll need to find the secret
   floors on your own.
* Red damage flash no longer occurs when the player is in
   God Mode (yes!!).

-- Known Bugs ----------------------------------------------

* When  the  player starts a new game and chooses  their
   preferred  difficulty,  the  game  no  longer   asks   for
   confirmation if a game is already running. It just deletes
   it and starts a new one. I did not intend this, but perhaps
   it's not really a bad thing...
* Every  once in a long while, the digital sounds  might
   get "silenced" by one of the sounds that plays. This appears
   to  be  a bug with some of the digital sounds in the game;
   longer  sounds are more apt to cause this problem.  If  it
   happens, just hit the B+A+T keys simultaneously to display
   version information. This also apparently resets the digital
   sound engine and reenables the sounds.


== VERSION HISTORY =========================================

-- v1.01 -- Released October 31, 1999

   Bug Fixes:

   * Changed keycode required to enable debug keys. Code is
      now  Left Shift + Home + Backspace. This is so people
      with  scaled-down  keyboards or  laptop computers can
      access debug mode.
   * Couple of minor corrections to the help screens.

-- v1.0 -- Released October 30, 1999

   Original Version.
