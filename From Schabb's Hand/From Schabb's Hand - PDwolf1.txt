Description             : A 3 level episode (4 w/ the secret). I made 4 levels when 
right after I 			  had finished my first SoD levels. They were supose to be part 
of a full 			  episode that I was going to make. I lost interest and I released them. 
			  I fixed the enging of FLOOR03 and ta-da!
