^C2cMod Information ^C00
First of all this mod was not originally my second mod. I had run into a major problem with my second mod, so I abandoned that one and started this mini experimental project. I have great news though! I have solved the problem (or so I think) that I had in my second mod, which means I will most likely release it after this one.

This mod is not an ordinary Wolfenstein mod. Even though at first glance it looks like a simple mapset, you will shortly come to realise that there is a major mechanic implemented into this mod. I gave this mod that name for a reason... Anyways, the next page will have spoilers about what this mod actually has to offer so don't go to the next page if you want to be surprised.

^C2cActual Mod Information ^C00
This mod is an experimental mod that I've wanted to do for a little while. Basically the mutants have had enough of the Nazi shenanigans so they have gone rouge and are killing all the Nazis that cross their path. You as the player are given the option to let the Nazis and mutants fight, or you can interfere and kill everyone yourself.

^C2cAllies ^C00
Later on you call for backup and your fellow allies are there to help you. Although they are strong and powerful. Are they strong enough to take down the mighty mutants? Allies can also be found in prison blocks, you can free them so they help you kill enemies. Be careful though, as if you mistake your ally for an enemy, you can accidentally kill them.

^C2cEnjoy! ^C00
This is pretty much all I have to say for this mod. Like I said this is an experimental mod so if you run into anything odd, don't be surprised. Gameplay varies and has many different outcomes, which I enjoy.

I hope you like this mod!
