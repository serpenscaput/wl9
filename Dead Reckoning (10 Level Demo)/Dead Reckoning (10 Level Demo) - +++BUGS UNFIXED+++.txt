There are many bugs in this game as my debugger bailed on the project.
As i can no longer install my compiler , they will not be fixed at this 
time.

-Roof texture is repeated on floor
-Multiple ammunitions dont work
-Ambiant sound does not work
-problems with menus
-extremely out of date debug messages

This is the only version of the game to be released for the time 
being as the project is shelved until furthur code assistance is 
found. 

Comments suggestions etc to: sporb2000@yahoo.co.nz

Please do not send me a list of bugs. Wait until another version is 
released in the future

i do hope you enjoy this rather tatty package.
