^C4D The Knights of the SS Series Continues

^C00 Our members in Allied Military and Intelligence report that an Allied spy BJ who escaped from Castle Wolfenstein, 
has been dispatched back to Castle Wolfenstein to recover the Spear of Destiny. 
We have also heard from connections in the French Resistance that the SS is now searching for the Holy Grail.
They have raided a catacomb under the Notre Dame Cathedral after translating some stolen documents from another order.  
They have also been said to be excavating Old Norse Runes.

^C00 Panu Ro Island, ZEBEZ River, ZaKek Ro Pass, and TonaKu RO Temple.
 They are based on following from Island Coast, to a River through Mountains, to a grand water way avenue of Shrines, 
to a Great Temple. There are multiple pyramids throughout the levels. 
I will find a way to make them available soon.
