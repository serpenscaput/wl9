More graphic from AREyeP and MCS are used 
I arthacked one changing the backdrop color from white to Royal purple. It is a Nazi Heraldric Crest feat. Dual Lion Supported Crowned Swastika Blazen Coat of Arms. I also used some deciduous trees from EOD, for this edition so I could get it out on time for the Summer Solstice New Moon.
I will make some deciduous tree graphics for future mods another time. I have made many plant gfx......
