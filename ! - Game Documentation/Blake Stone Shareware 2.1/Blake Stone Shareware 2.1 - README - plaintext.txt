        Version 2.0 - Added Function Key support. Produced a
        memory resident version.
        Version 1.1 - Minor bug fixes. Fixed problem with files
        shorter than 1 page and repaint of pages already displayed.
        Version 1.0 - First release


























~#2                     Program Description

            TXT2COM is a simple program which makes an ascii text file into a
       full screen display. It is useful for documentation and for "README"
       files which can be shown on the screen and then printed out. The COM
       file created by TXT2COM is easy to use and intuitive. There is a help
       line on line 25 and an optional title on line 1. The cursor controls
       move around the file and the Esc key exits.

           Creating a text COM files is easy. Enter at the dos prompt:

       TXT2COM textfile comfile heading

           Textfile is the name of the ascii textfile to be converted.
       Filenames can include disk and paths. Comfile is the name of the COM
       file to be created. If you leave off the .COM, the program will add
       one. Heading is anything you want to appear at the top line of the
       display and can be any character (except dos pipe and redirect
       characters) and any number of words. Headings are automatically
       centered.
           I created this file by entering:

            TXT2COM TXT2COM.DOC README.COM TXT2COM DOCUMENTATION

       LIMITS:

            As a practical limit, text files should be no larger
       than 50k. TXT2COM will convert files up to 55K, but there
       are some factors to consider. Each line in the text file
       expands the COM file by 2 bytes. The maximum size of a com
       file is 64K. The driver takes up 2K. 64K - 2K - 55K leaves
       7K for line numbers which is 3500 lines. If the 55k
       text file averages 10 bytes per line then it has 5500 lines
       and will not convert. If it has 20 bytes per line then
       it contains 2,750 lines and will convert. The best way to
       tell is to convert the file, display it and press the End
       key. If you see garbage, then the file is too big.

            The memory resident version, TXT2RES.COM uses about
       7.5K for its driver, most is screen buffer and stack and
       the rest is code additions. This also limits the size of
       the text file.

                   ~40 Writing Out the Original File ~07

            You can write out the original text file to a file or to the
       printer by choosing option "T". (Just press the T key while the COM
       file is displaying the file.) The program will ask for a file name.
       Simply enter the name of the file at the prompt. If you want to go to
       a printer enter LPT1 or LPT2 (leave off the colon at the end).

            In resident files you cannot write out the original
       documentation.














~#5

                             Changing Screen Colors

            You can control screen attributes through the use of the tilde
       character (~). Normally the tilde is all but ignored. Tildes will
       display as tildes except when a tilde is followed by two hex digits
       or another tilde. Two tildes together mean force the display of a
       single tilde, no matter what follows the second tilde. When a tilde
       is followed by two hex digits the decimal number is converted to an
       attribute and will change the screen colors from that point on. The
       default color is 07 which is white on black. The attribute digits
       will change this.
            If you want to start out with an attribute other than the
       default 07 just make sure that the first 3 characters of the text
       file are a tilde sequence.












~#6
                          Using Function Keys

           You may include a Tilde string which is used as a marker in
      the text file. When a function key is pressed the program will search
      forward until it finds the corresponding Tilde string.
           The marker string is the combination of the Tilde character
      followed by a pound sign (#) and then the number of the function
      key from 1 to 0. (0 being the character used for function key 10).
           More than one marker can be included in the text for the same
      function key. If there is more than one function key, subsequent
      pressing of the function key finds the next marker. The search
      starts over again at the top when the bottom of the file is reached.
           The tilde screens for each of the function keys are:

                   F1 = ~~#1         F6 = ~~#6
                   F2 = ~~#2         F7 = ~~#7
                   F3 = ~~#3         F8 = ~~#8
                   F4 = ~~#4         F9 = ~~#9
                   F5 = ~~#5         F10= ~~#0

                These are examples of screen attributes:

~#8                  Using TXT2RES.COM

            TXT2RES works the same as TXT2COM except that it creates
       a COM file which can be included in an autoexec.bat to
       make the text file resident. The file can be brought forward
       at any time by pressing a HOT KEY combination. The default
       hot key combination is:
                     Alt-Left Shift-D
             TXT2RES is good for creating resident tutorials and
       references. Combined with the function key ability this can
       create powerful interactive screens which can augment any
       application.












~#9                   Changing the HOT KEY

           The default Hot Key combination is Alt-Left Shift-D.
       This is fine for some uses, but when more than one application
       uses this hot key combination or it conflicts in some way with
       an application then you must run HOTFIX on the COM file that
       you have produced. Do not run HOTFIX on TXT2RES.
            HOTFIX works by changing the letter in the hot key
       combination. It changes only the letter. The Alt-Left Shift
       part remains the same. The form of the HOTFIX command is:

               HOTFIX filename n

       where filename is the COM file you want to fix and n is the
       key letter that you want to change the hot key to. To change
       the hot key combination of a resident file called apphelp.com
       to Alt-Left Shift-H enter:

              HOTFIX apphelp.com h
