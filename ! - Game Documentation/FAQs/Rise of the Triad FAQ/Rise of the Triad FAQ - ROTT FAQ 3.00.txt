The Legal Purchase of RotT
According to Apogee Software, the following methods of purchasing RotT are
legal:
Directly from Apogee Software, in a retail store in a box distributed by
FormGen, or from one of our authorized overseas dealers.  A list can be
found in the dealers.exe file that accompanies Rise of the Triad.  You
can also purchase and download the registered version from the Software
Creations BBS (current as of September 9th).
    [1-3]
The Issue of Pirating:
    I would like to take a minute to discuss a very important issue facing the
software community today : pirating.  Pirating, as I'm sure you know, is
the illegal distribution of copyrighted software.  Great software like RotT
is the result of a lot of work by a lot of honest, nice people.  They
deserve compensation for their long hours developing the product that you
use.  That's why pirating is so terrible.  You may not consider it, but
every time an illegal copy is distributed these people are hurt, as well
as all their dependents.  If you have the registered version of RotT, and
you got it by one of the legal ways listed above, thank you for supporting
the shareware and software ideal.  If you haven't, pay now.
    Pirating is a crime.  You may not think that you can be caught, but
you can, and the penalties are severe.
        [1-3-1]
How can I report pirating?
    If you encounter pirating, or the willful participation of any of the
illegal methods of software distribution listed above, please call the
Software Pirating Association(which Apogee is a member of):
1-800-388-PIR8
REMEMBER!  SUPPORT THE SHAREWARE IDEAL!
(2) What is RotT?
    [2-1]
Now, the good stuff!
What is RotT?
    Rise of the Triad, or RotT, is a first person perspective adventure game
made by Apogee software.  RotT is a great blast-fest, and features a
RSAC violence rating of 4(wanton and gratuitous violence), making
it the most violent game ever!
    However, Apogee has led the way with an Industry First: an Adjustable
Violence level. The violence level in the current game can be changed from
none to excessive, and can be password protected.  For more information on
this feature, please see section 6-5 of this FAQ.  RotT also includes:
 - an excellent Multiplayer Option, called COMM-BAT(see Chapter 7), supporting
   modem, network, and serial cable games
 - multiple-story levels(up to sixteen stories high!)
 - fully-digitized actors, as opposed to the clay model techniques of certain
   other software developers who shall remain nameless
 - hazards upon hazards, including SpinBlades, Firechutes,
   Wanderwalls, and more!  You'll die in many, many ways!
 - 20 MB of graphics and sounds
 - 5 unique characters, each with their own strengths
 - super power-ups(Godfire!Godfire!Godfire!)
 - a unique save game feature, allowing you to view a "screen shot" of where
   you saved your game
 - 11 player network play
 - excellent AI for enemies
 - never-before-seen effects like parallaxing skies, fog, and lighting!
 - 32 levels plus 40 COMM-BAT ZONES(on the CD version, disk version
   has 30 COMM-BAT ZONES)
 - An infinite random level generator, so there is no end to the game.
   Well, all right it's not REALLY infinite.  There are actually only
   2,147,483,648 random level sequences( that's 2 billion, 146 million,
   483 thousand, 648).  If you're not a programmer, that number would have
   no significance to you.  However, if you're among the anointed, you
   would know that 2,147,483,648 is the maximum value for a LONGINT, which
   is a signed 32-bit number.  So there.
 - REMOTE RIDICULE(a PC first!) - send pre-recorded messages during COMM-BAT
   play and cruelly taunt your opponent.  Version 1.3 supports Live recording
   of messages during Net Play: simply speak into the microphone and all your
   opponents will hear your insult!
 - registered version supports : add-on game levels, add-on COMM-BAT levels,
   and add-on COMM-BAT sounds!  Doom Level Designers, go nuts over how easy
   it is to create levels!  No more sectors or sidedefs!
 - and MORE!

        [2-2-2]
What other games has Apogee made?
    Apogee is the distributor of Wolfenstein 3D, and the makers
of : Duke Nukem', Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold,
Raptor, Boppin', Wacky Wheels, Hocus Pocus, and more!
    Apogee will now release their cutting-edge 3D games through a company
called 3D Realms.  3D Realms has also released their first game, Terminal
Velocity, and quite a game it is.  But that's a whole different FAQ, by
Adam Williamson.
        [2-2-3]
Apogee?  Isn't that id?
    No, it is not.  Apogee and id have always been separate software
companies and always will be.  You see, Apogee is a developer and publisher
of software.  Almost all the games you see with the Apogee logo are written
by Apogee.  However, id wrote a few games and distributed them through Apogee,
namely a some Commander Keen episodes and Wolfenstein 3D.  Later on, however,
id switched to distributing their own games.
There is no bad will between the Apogee and id people, in fact, they are
good friends.
        [2-2-4]
What was RotT written in?
    RotT was written in Watcom C++ v10.0 with the Rational Systems DOS/4GW
extender.
            [2-2-4-1]
What is this DOS/4GW thing?
    The DOS/4GW extender in a shell for programs that are written in protected
mode.  Another protected mode shell is the resident DPMI extender distributed
with Borland C/C++.
            [2-2-4-2]
What is protected mode?
In the old days of computing, DOS programs had only 640 KB of memory to work
with.  In fact, ol' Bill Gates, President of Microsoft, once said, "640 KB
ought to be enough for everybody".  It wasn't.
    The next advance came with
the development of extended memory.  Extended memory provided a way for
programs to load their needed resources in a separate memory location and
free up more of that 640 KB to directly access.
   The most recent development came with the DOS protected mode extender. The
protected mode extender provides a way for programs to be able to directly
access all of the memory on a computer.  If your computer has a total memory
size of 8 MB, then a protected mode program can use that entire 8 MB area.
The ROTTHELP.EXE file distributed with RotT contains a more detailed
explanation of protected memory.  All right, if you really must know,
protected memory uses look-up values in a table which is stored in that
640 KB.  So you can't access that extra memory really directly, you
take a side turn and access it through a look up table.   But that's a
whole different FAQ.
    [2-3] The RotT Storyline
  You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High-risk United Nations
Task Force, sent on extremely covert operations to possible trouble spots
outside the three-mile boundary waters of member countries.  You are on a
routine reconnaissance mission on San Nicolas Island, located in the Pacific
twenty miles west of Los Angeles.  Your team is investigating possible cult
activity in an old monastery, when suddenly troops pour out of nowhere!
In the distance your boat explodes.  Just before your radio goes all static,
you hear desperate newsmen describing the systematic destruction of Los
Angeles. An escaped prisoner informs you that a pyrotechnics expert and a
rich studio head have joined forces with the Oscurido cult.  Their plan:
kill millions of innocent people for the glory of their master, El Oscuro.
Having no other escape route, the HUNT heads into the monastery, taking the
only course of action left: stop the Oscuridos or die trying.
    [2-4]
Why RotT?  Where did the idea for RotT?
To "Why RotT", Joe Siegler(Apogee's Online Support Manager) says:
   "Why not?  :)  Besides, if the market is so small as to only allow
    Doom, then we might as well pack up and go home now.  Besides, if you
    look at the list of features in ROTT, there's a lot in ROTT that can't
    be done in Doom."
To "the idea", Joe says:
   "Originally, the project was
    to be nothing more than new levels for Wolf3D, with a few extra added
    graphics.  It then turned into a Wolf sequel.  The original name was
    "Wolfenstein 3D II: Rise of the Triad".  The Wolf references got
    dropped, but the work done in that era is easy to see in ROTT."
    [2-5]
"Flavors" of RotT
        [2-5-1]
The ShareWare Version
This shareware version contains one episode entitled "The Hunt Begins", and
consists of 8 levels in episode one and 2 secret(warp-only) levels.
The shareware version supports only 4 COMM-BAT modes:
Normal
Collector
Hunter
Tag
The end credits to the shareware version are pretty silly. See section 3-6.
Also, read this note from Joe Siegler:
    "There is an extra version called Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins
    SPECIAL EDITION.  This is marketed in retail by LaserSoft.  It is the
    same as the regular shareware episode, except is has 3 extra levels, and
    3 extra COMM-BAT Levels that are not available on ANY other version.
    Apogee does not distribute this version, it is only available in stores
    from LaserSoft."
        [2-5-2]
The CD/Disk/Site License Versions
    The Disk version retails for $29.95, and contains 32 game levels and 30
COMM-BAT Zones.  Available for the disk version is the Triad PowerPack, for
$10, which contains an additional 10 COMM-BAT Zones.  The CD Version(Super
Triad) contains 32 game levels and 40 COMM-BAT Zones, as well as shareware
versions of many of Apogee's popular games.  The CD Version has
all the levels contained in the disk version plus the PowerPack, and it
retails at $34.95, which saves you five bucks.
    Both the CD and the Disk versions contain 4 game episodes.
    The Site License version is for Net Players.  It is CD only, and costs
$84.95.  The Site License version contains 50 COMM-BAT Zones in all, as well
as 11 command cards.  The Site License version is the only registered
version that can be played on a network unless each computer on
the network has it's own separate copy of RotT.  The shareware version
can be played on a network, but with a limit of 5 players.
See section 2-7 for How to Order This Really Cool Game.
            [2-5-2-1]
The CD Goodies
    On the CD is a directory called GOODIES, and it contains a lot of
extra stuff from Apogee.  It contains the following:
all the songs from the game in MIDI format
all the sounds from the game in .WAV format(including some not used in
the game)
some of the textures from the game in .BMP format
lots of scanned pictures from that hard-working gang at Apogee!
Zipped-up shareware versions of lots of Apogee games for easy uploading
RandRott, the Rise of the Triad random-level generator
RTSMaker, for making your own remote-ridicule sounds

The v1.3 CD has two more things.  First, there's a directory in GOODIES
called RottED that has Wayne Sikes' Rise of the Triad Level Editor.
There's also a directory off the root called PREVIEW that has screen
shots from Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.
 * The person who grouped the software together to put on CD was Joe Siegler,
   so you can tell him how much you like those groovy pictures. His e-mail
   address is in Chapter 11.
        [2-5-3]
Installing RotT
    To install RotT from the Disk Version, simply put in the first disk
and type install, then follow instructions.  After the files are successfully
copied, type SNDSETUP to configure your sound card for RotT.
    To install RotT from the CD, put the CD in your CD-ROM drive, switch
to that drive, and type INSTALL.  Apogee's graphical interface will let
you choose two install options, to either play from your hard drive or
play from your CD.  To play from your CD, you need lots of memory and a
fast computer and CD-ROM drive.  Hard disk installation is recommended.  The
install program on the CD also allows you to install lots of other shareware
Apogee games.
            [2-5-3-1]
The SNDSETUP Program
    In SNDSETUP, you configure your sound card for RotT.  Select Music from
the Main Menu and choose your sound card.  Then do the same for Sound FX.
The menu for Number of Voices determines how many voices can be played
simultaneously during game play.  The more voices that are played at
the same time, the slower the game will run.  The next menu allows you
to choose 8-bit or 16-bit mixing.  The 16-bit option provides better sound
quality but sacrifices game speed.
    [2-6]
Versions
        [2-6-1]

    [2-6-3]
I have vX.xx.  How do I update my copy of RotT?
    There are three areas where you can update your version.

FTP
    The official Apogee FTP site is "ftp.uml.edu" in the directory:
/msdos/games/Apogee/
        [2-6-4]
Why aren't saved games compatible between versions?
    When each version of RotT is released, the saved games from a
previous version can't be used on the new version.  This is because, in
order for the saved games to be compatible with the new .WAD and .EXE file,
the data structures in the save game file change slightly.  That's
why they can't be used.  In fact, they are automatically deleted by the
patch program.  Sorry!

What is a DIP?
A DIP is a Developer of Incredible Power.  This is what the Apogee
design team calls themselves. Tom Hall sent out a memo, and at the
end he said, "If we do this, we will be the Developers of Incredible
Power."  It stuck. See Chapter 9 for more.

Enemies
    The following is a list of all the enemies in the game plus a short
description of each.  Since Apogee used digitized shots of all their employees
in costume for the enemies, the names of who is what enemy(and who made the
sound for it) are listed in parentheses after each enemy.  Unless otherwise
specified, the voices are done by the same person.

Low Guards(Actor:Steve Quarrella, Former Tech Support)

There are lots of these.  They wear gray shirts and black slacks. They are
armed with pistols.

guard in the game.  You can either tell the game to put one there.  The other
way is to put a low guard.  In order to further maximize the actor randomness,
the game will look at the map grid before starting, and every time it sees that
there is to be a low guard, it will randomly pick a low guard, or a lightning
guard.

In regards to random guards, there is such a guard as "random".  When
constructing a ROTT map, this special guard will be different every time you
go into the level.  What the game does is looks and sees which guards are
actually placed in the level.  For example, if the entire map has Triad
Enforcers, Low Guards, & High Guards, it will pick the random actor from these
three.  Strike Team guards will not be picked randomly in this example, since
they weren't placed in the level by the designer.

I've never tried to see what happens if *ALL* the guards in a level are random
guards.  I also do not think it will pick a BOSS as a random guard, if you put
a random guard on a level with a BOSS."

These guards also wear olive green jackets.  If they're right next to
you, they'll steal your weapons.  Some of them also beg for mercy when
they're about to die. Beware, some have bazookas!
The ones that beg will just fall over and "die" if you don't kill them.
However, they don't really die, because if you turn your back on them, they
will get back up and start shooting again!

"The things that El Oscuro says are true Latin.  I forget what they mean
offhand, but it's stuff like "I'll kill you".  Except for one.  One of the
things that Oscuro says means "Eat Your Veggies".  That's a reference to the
old Commander Keen series where "Eat Your Veggies" is the name of the song
that appears in the Dopefish level.  :)   (The Veggies Latin one starts with

Enemies Not Used
    The following alternate enemies were digitized but not used at the end.
Joe Siegler says:
   "The female guards were removed from the game at the end of development
    after the manual was already printed.  The reason for this is that the
    plan was to have the game randomly pick between a male/female guard of
    the same type.  So, the game would have to keep the sounds/graphics
    for both the male and female guards in memory at once, and because of
    this, it really increased the amount of memory needed to play the
    game.  It was impossible to do this and make it work nicely in 8 megs,
    or AT ALL in 4 megs, so the idea was dropped.  However, the manuals
    were already printed, so there wasn't anything that could be done about
    it.  If you play ROTT all the way through, and finish it (the
    registered version) the right way, you'll see a (VERY LONG) list of
    credits.  At the end is a list of "Actors who were cut from the game".
    Since they were already digitized, we made use of a single frame of
    them, and stuck 'em in.  There were alternates to the low guard, the
    Overpatrol, and the Strike guards.  The rest didn't have female
    counterparts."

The following alternate enemies were not used:

Alternate Low Guard(Actor:Marianna Vayntrub, Mark Dochtermann's Fiancee;

well, they're just cool, let's put it that way.
Scott's Mystical Head(SS)(+) - a digitized frame of Scott
Miller(the President of Apogee)'s head.  This super-secret item gives
you 2,764,331 points. A sound clip also says, "Scott's Mystical Head!"  This
item is found on the level called "the room".  1-800-276-4331 is Apogee's
order number.  Hint, hint.
Joe Siegler says:
    "It's a digitized shot of Scott Miller, the President of Apogee.  The
    idea was to find something really super secret, and the frame used was
    one of him in shock.
    Remember "The Wizard of Oz", and the "Pay no attention to the Man
    behind the curtain" bit?  Well, the joke was based off of that.  The
    real reason isn't all that interesting I suppose, it's just funny to
    us.  :)"

How do I defeat General Darian?
    Darian does not have any special weaknesses, but a trick to know
when fighting Darian is how to avoid the SpinBlade Stabbers he uses.
If you stand underneath a light, Darian can't use his Stabbers against
you.  If you do it right, you can blast him through an open door and
then scoot out of the way.
        [3-3-2]
How do I defeat Sebastian "Doyle" Krist?
    There are no tricks to defeat Krist, but
Joe Siegler says:
    "... Krist, if he escapes
    the room, and goes up on a stairwell of GAD's will stay up there, and
    won't come back down.  That's a bug.  It was fixed in v1.3 registered,
    but is cute to see if you don't have v1.3 registered."
        [3-3-3]
How do I defeat the NME?
    Joe Siegler says:
    "NME can't fire at you if you land on him, but if you land
    on top of NME, you're pretty much SOL anyway, since as soon as you
    jump off, you're hosed.

    Oh yeah, don't lead NME out of the room he's in.  We never intended
    for him to leave the room he's in, and if you do, and get him down
    near the SpinBlades, the game will crash."
So there are no tricks to defeat the NME.
For those of you who were expecting a little more and are disappointed,
this is the exact answer that I got straight from the horse's
mouth(Joe Siegler):
   "I have a standard answer for all other bosses
    besides El Oscuro:
    As for the boss creature, there is no trick that I can tell you like
    'move the left arrow five times, hit the up arrow, dance a jig, fire 7
    times'.  It's really just a timing thing.  You need to watch the guy,
    and see what his pattern is.  All Apogee boss creatures have patterns,
    and if you watch them, you'll see where you can safely go and where
    you cannot go."
    [3-3-4]
How do I defeat El Oscuro?
Joe Siegler:
    "The trick to El Oscuro in the "Lair of El Oscuro" level is to not fire
    at him at all.  You need to just avoid him for awhile, and he'll
    eventually expend his own energy and die.  Firing at him only makes
    him stronger.
    Bear in mind that this is not the last level, there are two more
    levels with some variant of El Oscuro."
        [3-3-5]
How do I defeat Snake Oscuro?
    Joe Siegler says:
    "Here's how to really do it.
    (This solution implies that you save your game several times, since
    you'll probably die a few times doing all this if you've never done
    it before.)

    To defeat El Oscuro properly in the "In the Dark Nest" level, you need
    to first get rid of the two rooms of larvae that are at the start of
    the level.  Do NOT go up the stairs right away.  Back up, and get one
    of the heat vests, and look around on the left hand wall.  There's a
    bunch of larvae in there.  Destroy them, and while you're in there, go
    over towards the Oscuro wall, and you'll hit a touchplate.  Then, go
    back to the stairwell, but do not go up, go into the similar room of
    larvae on the other side, and you'll note that a wall has moved back,
    and you'll be able to get the Oscuro key behind a wall that was in the
    way (it would have been in the way if you went to this room first).
    Get rid of all the larvae in this room too, and THEN you can go up the
    stairwell (you might as well grab a fully charged weapon and another
    heat vest before you go up there).

    Go to the top of the stairs, but do not go over yet.  Look down, and
    you'll see two "rooms" in front of you.  The rightmost one is the one
    you want to go at first.  If you just walk off gently, you'll fall on
    a mercury mode that is suspended in the air.  If you run off, you'll
    miss it.  There's a touchplate around the outside of the aforementioned
    "room" that will allow access inside.  (This goes for all 4 "rooms" in
    the main battle chamber, but this one is the one we want to concern
    ourselves with now).  Anyway, inside there is a touchplate.  Hit that
    touchplate, and a firewall at the far end of the room, a firewall will
    move out of the way revealing a doorway which is opened with the
    Oscuro key you got before you came up the stairs.  To get over the
    wall, you need to do one of these things.

    Try not to let Snake Oscuro get trapped in here with you, or it will
    make things very difficult.

    1) Fly over it (if you got the mercury mode when falling off the steps)
    2) Grab the firevest, and then the firebomb.  Turn around, and point
        the firebomb at the floor.  You'll fly up in the air, and over the
        wall.

    Once over, there's a pushwall to be pushed.  Follow the now opened up
    pathway, and you'll be led to the third room of larvae.  Look out in
    this room, as there are a lot of Deathfire Monks in here, too.  Once
    you dispose of all the larvae, SAVE YOUR GAME!  :)  You can then go
    back out the way you came in, and defeat the Oscuro Snake, and on to
    final victory.
    Note: The Oscuro snake can only be hurt when he's over a firepit."

Players
    There are five available characters in the registered version.  They are
listed below.  Only the first is available in the shareware episode.

1) Taradino Cassatt
2) Thi Barrett
3) Doug Wendt
4) Lorelei Ni
5) Ian Paul Freeley(Get it?  I.P. Freeley.)
        [3-4-1]
What are the strengths/weaknesses of each player?
Taradino Cassatt:
    Cassatt is Mr.Average.  That's why he's in the shareware episode.  He
has average life, average speed, and average weapons accuracy.  If nothing
special is called for, Cassatt's a good choice.
Thi Barrett:
    She's pretty average, too.  She's a female average character, in case
you don't like Cassatt or you prefer a female character.  She's a little
faster than Cassatt.  My personal favorite.
Doug Wendt:
    This guy is a tank.  He's pretty slow, and only has average weapons
accuracy, but, man, he can take tons of damage.  Lots o' hit points here.
Lorelei Ni:
    Not many hit points.  Fast.  Extremely good weapons accuracy.  Not
for beginners.
Ian Paul Freeley:
    Freeley is a player who is provided for a happy medium between players
like Cassatt or Barrett and Wendt.  He's got more hit points than Cassatt
or Barrett, but he's slower.  On the other hand, he doesn't have as many
hit points as Wendt, but he's faster.
    [3-5]
Weapons.
Hee hee hee.
Keep in mind that firing rate is only an approximation by me.  Initial Ammo
is how much ammo you have when you pick up the weapon.  Once again, a weapon
followed by a (+) is in the registered version only.  The things one
can do with a stopwatch and a lot of time on one's hands.
BULLET WEAPONS:
Pistol - Standard start off weapon.  Better upgrade quick unless all you
    want to do is see yourself die, which is pretty cool in itself.
    Initial Ammo : Infinite
    Firing Rate : 2.5 shots/sec
    Damage : 13 HP
Dual Pistols - Better than the regular pistol but still not good enough.
    Initial Ammo : Infinite
    Firing Rate : 3.25 shots/sec
    Damage : 26 HP
MP40 - Good weapon.  You should use this on lower enemies and save your
    ammo.  For instance, if you get a heat seeker and you're in a room of low
    guards, use your MP40.  Save the heat seeker.
    Initial Ammo : Infinite(Thank you, DIPs!!!!!)
    Firing Rate : 4.25 shots/sec
    Damage : 10/bullet
MISSILE WEAPONS:
All the missle weapons have a firing rate of
2.2 missles/sec
except the Split Missle.

Bazooka - Pretty straight forward.  Point, shoot, boom.  Best weapon, I think,
    to get ludicrous gibs.
    Initial Ammo: 10 missles(NOTE:
    if you get this weapon by killing a lightning guard, it will only have
    3 shots left).
    Damage : 160-222
Heat Seeker - This works better the farther away you are from your enemy.  If
    you are too close, it's likely that the missle will not be able to turn in
    time and will miss.  This is a good weapon, but the missles aren't very
    powerful.
    Initial Ammo : 7 missles
    Damage : 100-162
Drunk Missle - Without a doubt the most fun weapon.  Not the most powerful,
    but, man, it's really cool.  Even the sound is cool. Upon firing, a
    cluster of 5 missles shoots out which then heat seek.  The results are
    _messy_ :).
    An individual missle is pretty weak.
    Here's a neat little story about Drunk Missles from
    Joe Rovang(jrovang@netcom.com):
       "I love trying to outrun drunk missiles in Comm-bat play.  Once I
        was killed three separate times in a row by the same single shot of
        drunk missiles.
        Another time I was trying to outrun drunk missiles, I managed to
        dodge them and get them to chase me as I ran toward my opponent (the
        one who shot them).  I slipped around him and into a corridor just in
        time to have him get splattered by his own drunks, while I got away
        without a scratch."
    Initial Ammo : 7 clusters of 5 missles each
    Damage : 25-56/missle
Firebomb - Dangerous to you and to enemies.  This is a long range weapon
    only.  You should be very careful.  Some of us have been fragged more
    than once by being too trigger happy and using it in close quarters.  >:)
    Upon firing, little mushroom clouds spread out in a "X" formation.  Good
    for checking behind corners.  Another good use of the firebomb(when you
    have an asbestos suit) is if you shoot it down(so the missle detonates
    right next to you) it will fling you up and away.  A workable alternative
    to not having Mercury Mode.
    Initial Ammo : 5 missles
    Damage : 150-242
Flamewall - One of the best weapons to use.  Whenever you use it you
    should try not to hit people with the missle but have it hit the ground in
    front of them.  This is because the missle isn't powerful enough to kill
    with a direct hit, but on hitting the ground, a wall of fire spreads out
    and goes away from you. All regular enemies are instantly fragged by this
    fire.  The flamewall is great for Multiple Frags.  NOTE: If you have a
    fast player, you can actually run into your own wall of fire.  It's
    not pretty, especially in COMM-BAT.  Doh!
    Initial Ammo : 5
    Damage : death or destroys Asbestos vest
Split Missle(+) - This weapon is pretty cool.  It works like this:
    You hold down the fire button and a missle shoots out.  When you release
    the fire button, the missle splits into 2 missles which go out at 45
    degree angles and heat seek.  This is good because the individual
    warheads are about average strength, and while's they're combined
    they're a bit stronger than a bazooka shot.  The missles release like
    this:
                                 (You)
                                   |(Missle)
                                   |(You release fire button here)
                                 /   \  (Missle)
                      (Missle) /       \
    Initial Ammo :  7 missle clusters of 2 each
    Firing Rate : N/A(will not fire constantly if you hold down the fire
    button)
    Damage : 100-162/missle
MAGICAL WEAPONS:
Excalibat(+) - A glowing bat that you can hit enemies with(which
    isn't very powerful but it really cool to see).  If you hold down the
    fire button, after a period of time(See firing rate) a 180 degree wall
    of glowing, explosive baseballs fire out, and those baseballs are really
    powerful.  It's called an Excaliblast.
    You can really have fun with this one.
    Initial Ammo : Infinite swings, 10 Excaliblasts
    Firing Rate : 1 Excaliblast/3.5 seconds
    Damage(Swing) : 10-50
    Damage(Excaliblast) : 160-122/ball  <---  Yep.  Per ball.
Dark Staff(+) - Super powerful and really cool looking.  The fire from
    this weapon in a black sphere rippling with energy.  One shot will
    destroy all regular enemies(not bosses).  NOTE:  The Dark Staff's
    sphere will travel through a door or an enemy if you are right next
    to them.  So, shoot through a Door.  It's cool.  Come on, live a little.
    Initial Ammo : 7 Kinetic Energy Spheres
    Firing Rate : .6 shots/sec(1 shot/1.704 sec)
    Damage : 280-432
POWERUP WEAPONS:

    You laugh at all enemies.  Godfire will seek out and discorporate all
    enemies in the area near you, and a few shots will destroy a boss.  If
    you're playing COMM-BAT, the person who's in God Mode flickers with
    many different colors.  God Mode lasts 30 seconds.  Fire away.

    Firing Rate : 1.2 shots/sec
    Damage : 500/Godfire
Dog Mode(+) - You're 3 feet tall.  YOU ARE INVINCIBLE.

    them with the BarkBlast(which is unleashed by holding down the fire
    button.  If you're playing COMM-BAT, the person in Dog Mode looks like
    a miniature player with a dog's head.  The dog's head has glowing eyes.
    Dog Mode lasts 30 seconds.
    Initial Ammo : Infinite biting and BarkBlast.
    Firing Rate : 1 Barkblast/3.5 seconds
    Damage(Bite) : 30
    Damage(BarkBlast) : 100

Shareware End-Credit Silliness.
    If you've played and beaten the Shareware version, and waited for
a while at the end screen, you'd notice that the last message on the screen
would occasionally change.  These messages are silly little things put
in by the programmers.  They change as the version number changes(they
get progressively sillier).  Here's a list of them, courtesy of Joe
Siegler:
Version 1.0:
    1) You've won the battle, Cassatt.  But when the Oscuridos return,
    will you be ready as they wage their Dark War?
    2) Armed with only a pistol and 30 bucks, you must stop the minions
    of El Oscuro before they kill millions of innocent people.
    3) Take a vacation.  You've earned it.  Maybe on San Nicolas Island...
    4) Thanks for playing.  If you liked "The HUNT Begins", check ordering
    info for information about continuing your adventure.
    5)
    6)
    7)
    8) Look, this is pointless.  You are done.  Push off.
    9)
    10) Wow, you must like this fine background screen.
    11)
    12)
    13) Sigh.
    14) All right, um . . . you found the secret message! Congratulations!
    15) Didn't work, huh?  Okay, how about this . . .
    16) THE END
    17) Dang. Thought I had you there.
    18) Stop watching.  Pretty please?
    19) With sugar on top?
    20) Wait . . . I could just go to the demo loop!  See ya.
    After #20, one of the patrol robots comes on the right side of the screen
    and the text "Am I late?" appears over his head.
Version 1.1
    #1-#12 Same as Version 1.0
    13) Fnord.
    #14-#18 Same as Version 1.0
    19) Bet you were expecting some new messages in Version 1.1.
    20) Well, too bad.  This is the only one.
    21) OK, I lied.  There are 2 different messages.  So sue me.
    22) Actually three is a nice number.  That's it.  Hope you enjoyed it.
        P.S. did you find the new cheat codes?
    After #22, the patrol robot comes out.
Version 1.2
    #1-#12 Same as Version 1.1
    13) "Bob"
    #14-#18 Same as Version 1.1
    19) You know that if you registered, there would be a lot more cool stuff
    happening right now.
    20) Episode IV : A New Hope  *(FAQ Author's Note: For those of you living
        in the Stone Age, this is from the first Star Wars movie)*
    21) Just think of all the new secret messages you could find hidden in
    the registered version!
    22) Someone right now is probably enjoying the really exciting ending of
    the registered version.
    23) ROTT was filmed before a live audience.
    24) No animals were harmed during the creation of this video game,
    although one dog did get its butt spanked when it peed on the carpet.
After #24, the patrol robot comes out.
There were no changes in V1.3 over V1.2.

Bonuses in the game and after...
    If you've played RotT, you've probably noticed that you get some
bonuses after some levels.  If you want to know what they mean, here they
are(note, they are also included in the ROTTHELP.EXE file supplied with
version 1.3).
    BONUS                  WHAT IT MEANS
    Supercharge Bonus      Got all powerups on level
    Adrenaline Bonus       100% Kills
    Bleeder Bonus          used all health items on level
    Skin of Teeth          ended level with 1 dot of health
    Republican Bonus 1     Got all missile weapons on level
    Republican Bonus 2     Destroyed all plants on level
    Democrat Bonus 1       Never used a handgun on level
    Democrat Bonus 2       All shrooms & healing basins used on level
    Ground Zero Bonus      Hit with your own missile (hint: FW)
    Bull in China Shop     Destroyed all life items on level
    Curiosity Bonus        Every switch, pushwall, pillar, sound area
                           pushed, messed with, or whatever
    Bonus Bonus            Got all bonuses

    It is REALLY hard to get the Bonus Bonus.

    There are more bonuses at the end of the whole game in Dark War.  They are
    pretty tough to get, too.

  Genocide Bonus         Kill every one of the same type of actor in the game.
                       This can be gotten multiple times depending on how many
                       different types of actors you can wipe out.
    DIP Bonus              Collect all three developer balls.

Level Descriptions
From Joe Siegler:
Here is a listing of all the levels for Rise of the Triad, and who
designed them.  The vast bulk of levels were done by Tom Hall, so to
avoid typing his name a zillion times, assume it was done by Tom Hall
unless you see a name after the level.

Also, the individual registered episodes have their own names, but this
information was never really publicized much.  Their names are also
listed here.

Hints
If a level has a hint that I can find, here it is.
These hints come from the RotT Players Guide(See Ch.11), and I
can't very well copy that entire book into here, so if a hint seems
too cryptic, tough.  Use the map cheat or something else.
E1A1  Get the four one-ups on this level.  The first is easy:
Wait 2 minutes and shoot some guys while the elevator comes.  The
second is hard : run like the wind to outrun the closing wall.
The third is easy : Use a jump pad to land on a pillar and
push the wall back.  The fourth is hard : Avoid the fireballs.
E1A2  Getting the two 1 ups while in Dog Mode is the big thing here.
E1A3  The way to the secret level is fairly easy.  Leap to get
the Mercury Mode power up in the maze, then fly to the secret room,
shoot, push the pushwall, and fly to the exit.  Don't forget the 2
one-ups.
E1A4  Use the God and 2 Dog power-ups.
E1A5  You can get all the ankh coins in the room with the cage.
It takes practice.  Try all the jump pads in the room.  The optional
area is harder; in fact, these are the toughest jumps in the whole game.  The
next-to-last jump is nasty.
E1A6 The elevator area is the hardest.  Use the jump pads to skip
part of the puzzle.
E1A8 Don't miss the 2 power-ups, especially the one the touchplate
maze.
E2A1 The Excalibat is hidden by a bunch of pushwalls just off the
secret bird-shaped room.
E2A2 Get the gas mask hidden in the hallway before entering the gas room.
Don't miss the one-up in the touchplate tunnel.
E2A3 This map has Scott's Mystical Head.  Get the Mercury power-up, destroy
the gun emplacements, and meet Scott.
E2A4 There are 2 one-ups in this level, but I hope you like pushwalls.
E2A5 There's 2 one-ups(one easy, one hard), and a secret exit to the secret
level.
E2A6 The first Developer Ball is in this level.
E2A8 2 one-ups.
E3A1  3 one-ups and a God powerup.
E3A2  2 one-ups and Godmode.
E3A3  The I Developer Ball is easy to get here, use the fireproof vest
hidden behind a maze pushwall.
E3A4  Go into each side room to move the pillars out of the way
on the East side of the level.  If you have Shrooms mode, the pushable
push pillar will glow; this is true of any pushpillar maze.
E3A5 Bring big weapons when you round the corner.
E3A6 Traps guard the way to the secret level...
E3A8 A power-up kind of level.
E4A1 Get the Dog and God mode powerups for Monky Fun.
E4A2 Four 1-ups and Dog Mode.
E4A3 Don't panic at the start, just walk forward.
E4A4 3 one-ups for the true explorer.
E4A5 Getting out alive here is a trick.
E4A6 Don't let the calm at the beginning of the level fool you; it's a
trap.  The P Developer Ball is here.
E4A8 10 one ups.
E4A9 One up hidden near the end.

Cheating
    [5-1]
What are the cheat codes?
    Type in each cheat code, letter by letter, to get the
desired effect.  You can type in either the "code" or
the "alternate".  Note that for the codes, the slash
is a backslash, not a forward slash.  The codes are not
case sensitive.  The "dipstick" code must be given before
any others, to enable the other cheats.  Note that any
cheats marked by an asterisk work only in the registered
version of the game.  All other cheats work in both the
shareware and registered versions.  Codes that give a message on the
screen are followed by "confirmation message".

                               After a while, this just sucks the fun out
                               of the game.

(6) Playing RotT
Unless otherwise stated, this material comes almost verbatim from
the ROTTHELP.EXE file for version 1.3.
    [6-1]
What do I need to run RotT?
þ Rise of the Triad's minimum requirements are a 386DX/40 with 4 megs of total
  memory.  However, Apogee strongly recommends a 486DX2/66 with 8 megs of
  total memory, and a local bus video card.  A fast hard drive will also
  help things a lot.  A sound card is also strongly recommended.
  *FAQ AUTHOR'S NOTE: I run RotT on a 486 DX-33, at it runs fine.*
        [6-1-1]
How do I make more memory available for RotT?
  The best way around this is to "boot clean."  This means to boot your
  system without loading any unnecessary memory resident programs.  The
  easiest way to do this is to create a bootable floppy disk according to
  the instructions in your DOS manual (see the FORMAT /S command) and
  create a file called CONFIG.SYS and a file called AUTOEXEC.BAT on that
  disk.  Please refer to your DOS manual for instructions on creating these
  files.

  These files should contain the following lines:

   CONFIG.SYS
   ==========
   FILES=30
   BUFFERS=30
   STACKS=9,256
   <if your sound card requires a line in config.sys, put it here>
   <if you use disk compression, make sure to load that driver>
   <if you require a driver to access your hard drive, make sure to use it>

   AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ============
   @echo off
   <your path line>
   <your prompt line>
   MOUSE <if you play with a mouse>
   SET BLASTER=<see section on SET BLASTER for more help on this line>

  The <your path line> and <your prompt line> items in the sample
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file refer to the lines that start with the words PATH and
  PROMPT in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that is on your C:  drive.  These lines
  are optional, but including them will make navigating your hard drive a
  little easier.

  If you have DOS 5, you will need to create a boot disk and make
  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, using the above examples.  If you have
  DOS 6 or higher, you have two ways of booting clean without the need for
  a boot disk.

  For DOS 6 and higher, the fastest way is to reboot your computer and
  watch for a message that says "Starting MS-DOS" (IBM versions will say
  either "Starting PC DOS" or "Starting IBM DOS").  When you see this
  message, press your F8 function key.  You will then be prompted to
  confirm each line of your current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
  This will allow you to temporarily turn off the programs that you do not
  need or that may be causing problems.  ONLY ANSWER "YES" TO THE LINES
  SHOWN ABOVE AND THE "OK to process AUTOEXEC.BAT?"  QUESTION.  When
  finished, you will be left at a plain C:\> prompt.

  NOTE:  Pressing the Left Shift or F5 function key at the "Starting
         MS-DOS" prompt will not work properly.  ROTT requires at least
         30 available "file handles" to operate properly.  This is defined
         by the FILES=30 statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  If you bypass
         your CONFIG.SYS file completely by pressing Left Shift or F5, you
         are stuck with the DOS default of 8 file handles.  You will
         experience errors if you attempt to run the game this way.

  If you are more familiar with DOS, we strongly recommend that you set up
  a multi-boot option.  These newer versions of DOS allow you to set up
  multiple boot configuration sections in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  files, mostly eliminating the need for boot disks.  Again, please consult
  your DOS manual for instructions on how to create a boot disk, or a
  multi-boot configuration using the parameters stated above.

  ROTT is a protected mode program, and it does not require the services of
  such memory managers as QEMM, EMM386, etc.  Please read the section on
  protected mode programs for more information.
    [6-2]
What are the command line options?
  The command line parameters for ROTT are stackable, which means that you
  can use more than one at a time, if you need to.  An example of a stacked
  set of command line parameters would look like this...

  ROTT NOSOUND CYBERMAN

  Please note that while these are intended for use with the ROTT game, you
  can use them on the setup program.  The setup program will pass any command
  line parameters to the ROTT game that were given to it.

  Here is a list of the command line parameters you can use with ROTT.
  NOTE : These command line params are from v1.3 and some have no
  effect on earlier versions.

  ?                     ¯ Gives you a list of all the common command line
                          parameters used by Rise of the Triad.

  NOSOUND               ¯ This option turns off all sounds (both music and
                          sound effects) for the game, and makes it silent.

  QUIET                 ¯ Disables all displays of text (except error msgs)
                          that would normally occur before the title screen.

  NOJOYS                ¯ This turns off joystick detection.  Useful if you
                          are getting false joystick detection.  Use this if
                          the menus just start scrolling on their own, with
                          no input from you.
  NOMOUSE               ¯ This turns off mouse detection.  If your menus start
                          scrolling on their own, and the NOJOYS parameter
                          didn't fix it, try this instead.  If you still get
                          self-scrolling menus, try using both NOJOYS and
                          NOMOUSE together.

  NOECHO                ¯ Disables reverb/echo sound.

  DEMOEXIT              ¯ Forces the game to exit to DOS if the demo loop is
                          interrupted (by a keypress).

  TEDLEVEL              ¯ Used with Apogee's Internal ROTT Level Editor.  Has
                          no useful function other than for Apogee's use.

  SPACEBALL             ¯ This turns on detection for the Spaceball controller.

  CYBERMAN              ¯ Turns on detection for the Cyberman controller.

  ASSASSIN              ¯ Turns on detection for the Logitech Wingman Assassin.

  ENABLEVR              ¯ Enables driver for virtual reality hardware.  Contact
                          your VR hardware vendor for support.

  TIMELIMIT             ¯ Allows you to play for a certain amount of time
                          with unlimited lives.  Killing enemies and picking
                          up life items adds time to the clock.  (This is for
                          standalone play only.)  If you use this, you MUST
                          also use MAXTIMELIMIT.

  MAXTIMELIMIT          ¯ Sets the maximum time limit you can play, so you can
                          only earn up to this many seconds of time.

  WARP                  ¯ Warps to a specific level number from 1 to whatever.

  DOPEFISH              ¯ See section 6-2-1.  :) :) :)

  FILE                  ¯ This is the name of a user added wad file for ROTT.
                          For example, if you wanted to use a custom wad file
                          named FNORD.WAD, you'd need to type in this...
                          ROTT FILE FNORD.WAD   You can add three such files
                          using this method.

  SOUNDSETUP            ¯ Makes ROTT go through setting up your sound card.

  VER                   ¯ Shows the version of ROTT you are playing.

  SLOWDEATH             ¯ When you die in ROTT, this will let you see your
                          death in slow motion, as opposed to the normal speed
                          it's shown at. "Wicked."

  NOWAIT                ¯ This will bypass all opening cinematics and screens,
                          and will place you at the Main Menu.

  NOW                   ¯ This will bypass all menus and screens, automatically
                          placing you into the game in Level 1 as the default
                          default character and using the default difficulty.

  PAUSE                 ¯ This will bring up a "Press any key to continue"
                          prompt when you first run the game.  This is useful
                          if you need to contact Apogee for help, and they need
                          to ask you a few questions about ROTT and your
                          system.

  NET                   ¯ Tells ROTT that you're playing a multi-player game.
                          This is listed here for completeness' sake, but
                          should never be used.  It's really used by the setup
                          program to pass data to the communication vectors.
                          In other words, the real explanation isn't worth all
                          the time it would take to explain it.  :)

  MAPSTATS              ¯ This will output the map statistics (ie: Number of
                          different walls, doors, etc.) of the current level
                          to the file MAPINFO.TXT.

  TILESTATS             ¯ This will output the tile statistics (ie: Number of
                          different actors, plants, objects, etc) of the
                          current level to the file MAPINFO.TXT.

  LEVELSIZE             ¯ Computes the amount of memory needed to run a
                          particular level.

  IS8250                ¯ This parameter is passed by ROTTSER.EXE.  It will
                          tell ROTT you are playing with an 8250, and in which
                          case, it will turn off the music for modem games.

The final three command line parameters were only used during development, so
we could make sure that the levels we were designing didn't blow up the game!

There are also some command line parameters that are used by the ROTTIPX.EXE
and ROTTSER.EXE programs to control various aspects of modem/serial and network
game play.  They are being provided here for completeness sake.  The incorrect
usage of these can cause problems.  Apogee recommends that you not use these
directly, and start all multi-player games from the setup.exe program provided.
Both sections require the use of the NET command line parameter for them to be
of any use at all.

These parameters relate to ROTTSER.EXE (Serial and Modem play)...

   VECTOR       interrupt vector with which to communicate with ROTT
   ANSWER       answer mode
   DIAL         dial mode
   PAUSE        pause before launching
   STATS        print out run time stats after ROTT returns
   PLAYER       0 - makes you the master
                1 - makes you not the master
                must be used on both systems with different values, to work
                properly

These parameters relate to ROTTIPX.EXE (IPX Network play)...

   VECTOR       interrupt vector with which to communicate with ROTT
   PAUSE        pause before launching
   NODES        number of players in game
   SOCKET       network socket to use
   SERVER       specify this computer to be a server
   STANDALONE   specify this server to be standalone
                else client on top of server
   REMOTERIDICULE turn on RemoteRidicule support
   MASTER       This will force a specific client in Comm-Bat ROTT to be Player
                1 (or the Master).  Only the first use of this in a game will
                be honored.  Any uses beyond the first will be ignored.  If
                this is not used, the first person to launch into a NetROTT
                game will be the Master. (This parameter can cause instability
                in Comm-Bat ROTT.  We recommend against it's use.)

What is ROTT DOPEFISH?
    If you type in ROTT DOPEFISH, the first screen you see is a head swirling
around the screen, and lots of belching.  The head is Scott's Mystical
Head(See the items section), and the belcher is Joe Siegler.  :)
The full story of the Dopefish is printed here from the APOGEE FAQ, which I
recommend you check out.  It's chock full of info.
(from the Apogee Faq)
Lee Jackson's history of the Dopefish, added to by Joe Siegler:

Dopefish is the product of the fertile mind of Tom Hall.  It was one of 24
drawings he did of ideas for characters for Commander Keen: Good-bye, Galaxy!
while part of id Software.  Dopefish was one of the characters from these
drawings that made the cut.  According to Tom, "I just drew this stupid
little fish," and the rest is history.

Dopefish is described in the cast of characters for Secret of the Oracle as
the second dumbest creature in the universe (the number one ranking is
anyone's guess).  His thought patterns go, "swim swim hungry, swim swim
hungry."  Dopefish "will eat anything alive and moving near them, though they
prefer heroes."

Dopefish was "adopted" by the Tech Support staff at Apogee soon after Joe
Siegler, Steve Quarrella, and myself came onboard.  Dopefish was Joe's
favorite character, and Steve was the resident Keen expert -- I provided a
few vocal effects and some art.  We got hold of some screen capture software
and went to town.

The Dopefish "product line" started with an ANSI screen which Joe and I did --
he converted a screen capture to raw ANSI, and I cleaned it up and made it
presentable.  You can see the results by logging into Software Creations and
typing DOPEFISH (or just DO for short) at the menu prompt.  After this, we
convinced Jay Wilbur of id to have some Dopefish polo shirts made from an EPS
file of the front-facing burping Dopefish (a.k.a. "Burpfish").  When Christmas
rolled around, my wife decided we needed to bring Dopefish into the real
world, so she made 20 or so stuffed Dopefish dolls (mostly side view, with a
couple of Burpfish for good measure).  These were done in both EGA (green)
and CGA (purple) versions and were given out at the Apogee Christmas party
that year.  When Jay Wilbur heard of this, his first thought was that we
needed to get a life.  This past Christmas, Brenda (my wife) took a printed
enlargement of a screen capture and did pixel-for-pixel-accurate needlepoint
tree ornaments, and Joe had coffee cups made with a Burpfish on them.  Below
the Burpfish on the mugs is the caption, "Eat Your Veggies!", which is the
title of the music for the level that Dopefish appears in, composed by Bobby
Prince.  Brenda also made a mobile of Dopefish for Christmas 1994, but due to
extreme delays in getting it done, it was never delivered until July 1995.

Please note that this Dopefish merchandise is not, and was not ever, for
sale to the general public.  They were all strictly in-house gags, so
please don't swamp Apogee with requests for any of these items.  However,
if you're a Dopefish fan yourself, and have created some goofy Dopefish
items yourself, Joe Siegler would love to hear about it.  See the sections
on "contacting Apogee" for information on how to reach him.

Other Dopefish-related items that have appeared include several Windows and
OS/2 desktops/icons (including the "official" OS/2 Apogee icon on the only
OS/2 machine at the office, mine), screen savers, and fax images.  There's
also a BMP that Tom Hall put together that, when tiled, looks great as a
Windows background.  The OS/2 logo and the Windows BMP are both available in
Apogee's CompuServe forum.  Joe Siegler has a full-page Dopefish that will
occasionally mysteriously show up in someone else's fax machine.  Dopefish has
also appeared in countless taglines, Internet signature files (described by
Tom Hall as "Pisces Swimeatus"), and even in a reinterpretation of the birth
of the universe, where the Big Bang is replaced by the Big Burp.  Steve even
holds the title, granted via a mail-order ordainment service, as "Pope of the
Church of the Dopey Fish."  The title is legally recognized, by Texas state
law.

Why Dopefish?  Well, he swims, he eats, and he burps.  What more can you ask
for?  I personally think that the latter reason is why Joe likes him so much.
Joe is known for a few wall rattlers and personally did the voice of Dopefish
in Wacky Wheels and Rise of the Triad.  He really practiced for it, too.
Sitting at his computer at four in the morning with a two liter bottle of
Diet Coke, he ran through take after take, hurting himself a couple times
in the process, until he came up with just the right length and resonance.

To date, Dopefish has been involved in three Apogee games:  Commander Keen:
Good-bye, Galaxy! (as a character), Wacky Wheels (making a secret cameo
appearance), and Rise of the Triad (as a command line parameter and the
subject of a song, the "Fish Polka," composed by me).  In addition, the first
level in the rejected ROTT level set is called "Use the Fish."  If you load
this level up, use the map cheat, and look at the map, you'll see that the
entire level is essentially the Dopefish -- you're playing inside.  The title
"Use the Fish" comes from the fax that Jay Wilbur of id Software sent Apogee
when he granted them permission to use the Dopefish as a cameo character.

Even though he belongs to id Software, he is a welcome adopted member of the
Apogee family.  If there are ever any new Keen games, you can wager a goodly
amount that the Dopefish will be in it.

The Official RotT Player's Guide
    There is a book available from Apogee called "The Official
RotT Player's Guide".  This book is written by Bernie Yee, and contains
a complete inventory of all RotT objects, obstacles, and enemies.  It
also has a complete map as well as a walkthrough for every level
of the game, Q and A from the creators of RotT, and Tom Hall's tips
on creating your own levels.  I highly recommend it(I got a lot of
good stuff from it, but I couldn't very well put _everything_).

Using the SETUP Program
If you want to play a network, modem, or serial game, you must use the
SETUP.EXE program, found in your game's directory.  This setup program will
allow you to launch any of the multi-player games mentioned above, as well as
allow you to select alternate level packs, graphics, and sound (if you have
them), and access other miscellaneous game options.  This section of the
technical help file will explain and show you how to use the options that the
setup program offers.

Here is a brief summary of the options inside the ROTT setup program:

þ MODEM GAME

  This option will let you setup the parameters needed to play ROTT over a
  modem.  When you select this option, you will see a new menu with the
  following items listed:

  ¯ Quick Dial Default Number - This option will dial your default player
                                phone number without having to do anything
                                else.  If you have not set up any phone numbers
                                in the phone book, this will not be highlighted.

  ¯ Number List - This will bring up a screen where you can set up the various
                  phone numbers of your ROTT opponents.  You can use the up
                  and down arrows to scroll around the list.  Press "E" to
                  edit the parameters.  Pressing Space next to an entry will
                  define it as a default. You can only have one default number.
                  Pressing Enter on a selected phone number will dial that
                  number immediately.

  ¯ Manual Dial - This will let you manually enter and dial a phone number
                  that is not set up in your Number List.

  ¯ Wait for Call - This will put your modem into answer mode, so your friend
                    can call you to play.

  ¯ Change Modem Setup - This option will bring up another screen where you
                         can select your modem type from the supplied list of
                         modem strings.  After you select one of the modems,
                         you can then alter the init and hangup strings if you
                         so desire.  The file that these strings is kept in is
                         called MODEM.PCK, and is editable/listable with any
                         standard ASCII file editor/viewer.

  ¯ Change Dial Out Prefix - This option will be useful for people who might
                             need to enter a 9 to reach an outside line to
                             dial on, disable call waiting, etc.

þ NETWORK GAME

  This option will let you play ROTT via an IPX/SPX network.  Please note you
  need to have your IPX/SPX software loaded before picking this option, or the
  network driver will tell you it cannot find an IPX network.  There are two
  ways to play network ROTT.  You can either have one computer dedicated as a
  ROTT "Server", with all players launching the game from standalone "Client"
  systems, or you may have one player's computer act as both Server *and*
  client while all other players launch as Clients.  If you have more than 8
  players, you must have a dedicated server.  Please see the "Setting up an
  IPX/SPX Network Game" section for more information on starting network games.

þ SERIAL GAME

  This option will let you play via a serial (null-modem) cable.  Please make
  sure you have your COM port correctly defined before selecting this option.
  Please note that if you are playing a serial game, both players MUST select
  the same port speed, or the game will not work properly.

þ SETUP COM PORT

  This option will allow you to set up the various options of your COM port
  for modem or serial play.  This must be done before attempting to play either
  a serial or modem game, or you will have problems.  Pressing enter here will
  bring up a submenu of COM port setup options.  They are:

  ¯ Select COM port - This will tell ROTT which com port you are using.  If you
                      are unsure, check your computer's manual for more info.

  ¯ Select IRQ - This will let you alter the default IRQ settings for your COM
                 port.  This can be dangerous, and unless you know you need to
                 alter this, it is a good idea to leave this option alone.

  ¯ Select UART - This will let you alter the COM I/O port that your computer
                  uses to communicate.  A Hexadecimal number is required here.
                  This can be dangerous, and unless you know you need to alter
                  this, it is a good idea to leave this option alone.  This is
                  NOT where you indicate the type of UART chip you have.  The
                  UART chip type cannot be changed from the setup program.

  ¯ Select Port Speed - This option will allow you to select what port speed
                        you wish to open your com port at.  This is not to be
                        confused with a connect rate.  If you run into trouble
                        with modem/serial games, it's probably a good idea to
                        start with a low number and work your way up until you
                        find the fastest rate at which your systems can connect
                        successfully.  Also, the 115200 rate is only available
                        if you have a 16550 or higher serial chip/card.  While
                        8250 and 16450 are supported in v1.1+ it is recommended
                        that you use a 16550, due to the 16550's far larger
                        buffer size.  8250 and 16450 buffers are far smaller,
                        and can cause problems with multi-player ROTT games.

  ¯ Select PULSE/TONE - This option will let you tell ROTT what type of phone
                        you have; pulse or tone.  By default, this is set to
                        tone.  If you only have pulse dialing, this is where
                        you can alter this option.
þ USE MODIFIED STUFF

       ( This option is non-functional in the shareware version of ROTT )

  This option will allow you to play ROTT with various alternate files, from
  new levels, to different sounds and graphics.  Normally, these things are
  kept in the same directory as the ROTT game is, but if you wish to keep these
  files separate from the game itself, you can alter the directory that ROTT
  will look for them in by choosing the "Change Alternate Directories" Option.
  Any of the other options here will allow you to select which alternate file
  you wish to use.  In this example, I will use 'Alternate Game Levels'.  You
  would scroll down to "Choose Alternate Game Levels", and then press enter.
  You will be presented with a list of all the alternate game levels that are
  present in your defined level directory.  You would scroll to the one you
  wish to play, and press the space bar.  A û would appear next to the selected
  file, and it would then be loaded when you played ROTT.  Please note that if
  you select alternate files like this, you MUST run ROTT from the "Run ROTT"
  option.  Alternate level selections are not saved.  If you wish to play with
  alternate files, you will need to select them every time you wish to play
  the game.

þ CHANGE CODENAME

  When you play in multi-player mode, you are given the choice to enter a name
  that you are identified as.  This option in the setup program will let you
  choose a default name so you don't have to keep typing it in every time you
  play a game; whatever you enter here can be overridden when you start the
  game.  This is only here as a convenience.

þ MODIFY MACROS

  When you are in Comm-Bat mode, you can send preset pieces of text to your
  opponents instead of having to type the same message over and over again.
  This is where you set them up.  Use the arrow keys to scroll to the macro
  you wish to edit, and press ENTER.  You can type in your macro here.  Please
  see the section on Comm-Bat play on how to use these in the game.

þ CONFIGURE SOUNDS

  This option will let you set up your sound card for music and sound effects.
  You can alter the volume level for both music and sfx here.

þ RUN ROTT

  This option so incredibly runs Rise of the Triad!
    [7-2]
What do I do to play over the modem?
þ There are a few global rules that will apply no matter what you do in
  playing ROTT over the modem.  These rules are as follows:

 ¯ You must have a 9600bps modem or higher.
 ¯ When connected to another computer, both sides MUST use the same port speed.  I
 ¯ The init string you are using MUST disable data compression.
 ¯ The init string you are using MUST disable error correction.
 ¯ Make sure you are running from DOS.  Multi-tasking environments such as
   Windows or DesqView are not supported.
 ¯ This isn't a requirement, but we strongly recommend that you have a 16550
   chip as your serial chip.  Serial ports that use 8250's and 16450's are old,
   and do not have very large buffers, and can cause problems with modem play.
 ¯ This isn't actually a requirement, but we strongly recommend that you do
   this in your init string.  Have your init string monitor the DTR, and if
   dropped, have the modem enter command state.  This will allow ROTT to hang
   up the phone properly.  If you do not do this, ROTT may not be able to
   properly hang up the telephone when it's done.  This command is usually &D1.
   Please consult your modem manual for more information.

þ Please check your modem manual for the proper init strings.  Apogee technical
  support is unable to assist with specific modem string setups.  The reason
  for this is that in order to provide a tested string, we would have to have
  that modem, and since we do not have all modems at Apogee HQ, it is not
  possible for us to provide support on a modem that we do not have. The modems
  we do have are listed in the MODEM.PCK file under "Tested Modem Strings". If
  you find you need to make your own string, please consult your modem's manual
  or contact either the modem manufacturer or the computer vendor or
  manufacturer for assistance.  They will be able to provide much better info
  that Apogee's Tech Support department, since they are intimately familiar
  with their own product.  This goes for any error received during modem or
  serial play.  Virtually all of them are related to a bad modem init
  string.

þ If you have trouble getting your modem working with ROTT, but have been able
  to properly play either Doom or Heretic by id Software with your modem, you
  might wish to try the init string from Doom or Heretic in ROTT.  We've found
  that a lot of Doom modem strings work with Rise of the Triad.

So, you're sitting there saying, "I just want to set up and play!".  OK, here's
a list of the steps you'll need to follow to get ROTT up and running via modem.
Please consult the section on using the setup program for detailed help on how
to do these various things.

1) Type in "setup" to begin.
2) Go to "Setup COM Port" and ensure that the COM port you're using is setup
   properly with the right port speed, and adjust PULSE/TONE, if you need to.
   NOTE: For modem play, it is recommended that both sides open the port at
         the same speed.  If you are playing via serial mode, you MUST have
         both sides opening their ports at the same speed.  Start at 9600, and
         see if it works OK; you can then pick higher speeds if you wish to.
3) Go to "Modem Game" and set up your modem with the Change Modem Setup option.
   If you need to, also change the dial out prefix.
4) Go to the "Number List" & set up all your friends in the dialing directory.
5) If you are going to be called, just go to "Wait for Call".  If you are going
   to be doing the dialing, select someone and call them!
6) Once connected, you're ready to play Comm-Bat ROTT!  Please consult the
   section on Comm-Bat play for details on how to set up the various Comm-Bat
   play options of ROTT.
    [7-3]
What do I do to play over a network?
þ There are a few global rules that will apply no matter what you do in
  playing ROTT over a network.  These rules are as follows:

  ¯ The network has to have IPX/SPX protocols.
  ¯ Make sure you are running from DOS.  Multi-tasking environments such as
    Windows or DesqView are not supported.

Setting up network play is easier than setting up modem or serial mode.  Here
are the steps necessary for getting Comm-Bat IPX play working in ROTT.

1) Make sure your IPX/SPX protocols are loaded on all computers.  The ROTTIPX
   driver will not run without your protocols loaded.
2) Decide which computer will be acting as the ROTT server, and whether this
   computer will be playing or not.  If the server computer will also be
   playing, it should be a fairly powerful computer (we recommend at least a
   486 (not an SX) with at least 8 megs of memory, preferably more.  The reason
   for this is that the server computer will be at a slight disadvantage if
   playing, and more memory or a more powerful computer will help alleviate
   the problem.
3) Figure out how many people are playing.
4) If you are playing multiple games of ROTT on the same network at the same
   time, you will need to make use of the "Change Socket Number" option.
   Please see your network administrator for more info regarding what to put
   here.  This is something specific to your network.
4) Go to the ROTT Server and run the setup program, then go to 'Network game',
   and select "Launch as Server".
5) Enter the number of players and press ENTER.  The ROTT server will then
   wait for the designated number of players to join.
6) If the server computer is to be playing, pick "Client on top of Server."
   If there is a standalone server, pick "Standalone Server".
7) Go to the Client computers, run the setup program, and then select
   "Launch as Client".  Once the server is found, you will see a message
   telling you which player you are.  If the other players are slow getting
   into the game, they will be ridiculed on your computer!
8) At this point, you're ready to play!  Consult the Comm-Bat section on how
   to set up all the various play options of ROTT Comm-Bat play.

Here are some miscellaneous network items to keep in mind:

þ Each player must have a registered copy of Rise of the Triad on their
  computer, or there must be a site-licensed version of ROTT in use.  This
  does not apply if you are using Shareware only.

þ It is not possible to play a network game using a shared copy of the game on
  the network.  Each player must have an installed copy on their local machine.

þ ROTT will not work properly if players are on different LANs that are
  connected together.  Make sure that all players are on the same LAN,
  or you may not be able to play.

þ Live RemoteRidicule will only work in network mode.  Check your microphone
  before you play NetROTT to make sure that it is set up properly.

þ When playing NetROTT, we urge you to not select your network server as the
  ROTT server.  The reason for this is that if someone on your network starts
  making extensive use of your server and doing heavy disk access, you will
  note ROTT slowdowns.  The ROTT server can be any computer, not necessarily
  your network server.

þ Everyone should be at the DOS prompt before launching the ROTT server.
  Once the server is launched, the first person to launch as a client will
  be the "Master", if playing with a standalone server.  If playing with a
  Client on top of a Server, then the server will always be the Master.
  (See the Comm-Bat section for a description of Masters & Clients)  If you
  are playing with a standalone server, this can be overridden with the
  'MASTER' command line parameter.   If this is used, the first person to
  enter into the game with the MASTER command line parameter will become
  master, and any subsequent uses of the MASTER parameter in that game will
  be ignored.  The MASTER parameter will be ignored if you are playing with
  a Client on Top of Server setup.
    [7-4]
What if the players have different versions of RotT?
If you are playing Rise of the Triad's Comm-Bat mode, we strongly recommend
that all players either have the same type of game (shareware, registered,
CD, or Site License).  It is possible to play one version against another one,
but the process to start will be different.  If you need to play mixed versions
like this, it is recommended that the master computer be the version of the
game that is the lowest.  In other words, if one of the versions is shareware,
then that person should be the master.  This is the easiest way to do it.
If the lowest version is master, then you need to do nothing different.

If you are playing mixed versions, and the Master is not the lowest version,
then the Master must always select the Comm-Bat level set that is on the
lowest computer playing the game.  This is done by selecting the "Use Alternate
Comm-Bat Levels" option in the setup program.  In other words, if you have
three people playing, two of whom have ROTTCD versions, and one who has just
the registered version, the Master MUST select DARKWAR.RTC or an error will
occur.
The master is the player who calls the other, or, in NetPlay, the first
player to start RotT.
    [7-5]
Can I play RotT over the Internet?
    You may be able to using a program called IHHD, the Internet Head-to-Head
Daemon.
        [7-5-1]
IHHD
From Hank Leukart's Doom FAQ(modified by permission):
        Enter IHHD -- the Internet Head to Head Daemon designed by Jim
Knutson.  With this brilliant little piece of code, multiplayer gaming has
soared to new heights.  With IHHD, you'll be able to play Head to Head
against other human opponents all over the world, with the only cost to you
being the regular prices you pay to connect to or use your Internet host.
Best of all, it's free.
      First of all, your host needs to be running UNIX as its operating
system.  If you aren't sure what your host is running for its operating
system, check the information given at the login prompt or send mail to
your administrator.
      Other than that, you should be able to run IHHD with ease.  Your
first order of business is to get the IHHD software.  It is available via
anonymous FTP at "cactus.org" in the "pub/IHHD/src" directory.
      To get it:
      (1) FTP to cactus.org  ("ftp cactus.org" at UNIX prompt)
        (2) At the login prompt, enter "anonymous"
        (3) At the password prompt, enter your E-mail address
        (4) At the command prompt, type "cd pub/IHHD/src"
        (5) Type "binary"
        (6) Type "get dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (7) Type "bye"
      If you followed the above steps, you should now have the
"dialer1.6.4.shar" file in your home directory.  Type "ls" at your host's
command prompt to verify its existence.  If you don't see it, try the
above steps again or call for help.
      Next, if you've successfully retrieved the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file
from the FTP site, you need to prepare the IHHD to run on your UNIX system.
For UNIX veterans, the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file is in fact a shar file, and
contains a makefile for easy compiling on your system.  For the rest of
us, follow these steps to get the IHHD up and running:
      (1) Create a directory to put the IHHD software in.
           Type "mkdir IHHD" at the command prompt.
        (2) Move the IHHD file to the new directory.
            Type "mv dialer1.6.4.shar IHHD"
        (3) Go to the IHHD directory.
            Type "cd IHHD"
        (4) Unpack the IHHD files.
            Type "sh dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (5) Compile the IHHD software to run on your system.
            Type "make"
        (6) You should now see a whole mess of files in the IHHD directory.
            The important filenames you're looking for should be:
                "dialer"
                "tcpdialer"
                "tcpanswer"
                "call"
                "showlog"
        (7) If you've got these, you're cool.  Otherwise, try the above
            steps again, re-retrieve the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file from
            "cactus.org" using the instructions above, or call for help.
If everything checks out, you're ready to rumble!
Here's how you get connected using IHHD:
        (1) Set up a time to play with another Internet RotT player.
            Ideally, you should use E-mail to make the prior arrangements.
            Make sure you and your opponent use the same baud rate and line
            settings for your modems.
            Make sure data compression, error correction, and hardware
            flow control on your modem are off.
        (2) When it's time to play, start your favorite terminal program
            and call up your Internet host using your modem.  Make sure that
            your baud rate and line settings correspond to your opponent's.
        (3) Login to your Internet host normally.
        (4) Contact the other player by sending a short E-mail message
            indicating that you are on the net and ready to play.
        (5) Once you both establish that you're there and ready to go,
            return to your UNIX prompt.
        (6) Type "cd IHHD" to enter your IHHD directory.
        (7) You may have to type "terminal download," if you do not have it
            activated already.
        (8) Type "dialer opponent's.host" to start the IHHD connection.
            For example, if you were playing against knuston@cactus.org,
            you would type "dialer cactus.org" to initiate the connection.
            Another way is to type "tcpdialer opponent's.host" while your
            opponent types "tcpdialer -answer".  Or reverse roles, where
            you type "tcpdialer -answer" while your opponent types "tcpdialer
            your.host".  Don't ask me what the difference is; I don't know.
            So, to recap, there are two methods of IHHD connection.
            Method 1: dialer.  You each type "dialer other.guy's.host"
            Method 2: tcpdialer.  One of you types "tcpdialer other.guy's.host"
                      while the other types "tcpdialer -answer".
        (9) Regardless of which method you use to connect, type short text
            messages followed by a carriage return until you see your opponent
            acknowledge you.  Unless you have "local echo" set to ON in your
            serial settings, you will not see the text you type.
       (10) If you don't see your opponent after a reasonable amount of time,
            exit dialer or tcpdialer by pressing "CTRL-C" (i.e. hitting
            the "CTRL" and "C" key simultaneously.)  Contact your opponent
            again by E-mail and agree to try the other method of
            connecting.
       (11) If you're connection looks fine and your opponent has acknowledged
            you and you have acknowledged him, exit your terminal program
            and change to your ROTT directory.  Run SETUP.EXE, and select
            "Run Serial Game."
       (12) If everything goes well, RotT will start up and bring you to
            your first game over the Internet!  Congratulations, you are
            now connected by IHHD.  You can now proceed to play RotT as if
            you were connected via a regular phone line.
        Unfortunately, because of the nature of the Internet, delays and
warping may occur with your IHHD connection, depending on the quality of the
connection between your and your opponent's host machines.  These delays
are often sporadic, and depend largely on what's going on the Internet
at that particular times.  Then again, you might just be extremely unlucky
and have a cruddy Internet connection.
        To gauge the quality of the connection, try to "ping" your opponent's
computer from your host.  At the UNIX prompt, type "ping -s opponent's.host".
You should get a listing of "ping times", which you may stop at any time by
pressing "CTRL-C".  Try pinging some other hosts you know to get an idea of
how much ping times vary, and use this data to guesstimate the quality of the
connection between your host and your opponent's.
        Another way to judge the quality of your connection is to simply look
at the other player.  If he's jumping all over the place, you've got a
cruddy connection.  If he's relatively smooth and steady, you've got a good
connection.

What is COMM-BAT?
    COMM-BAT is Multiplayer RotT, whether it be through a modem, serial,
network, or Internet connection.
        [7-6-1]
What are the different kinds of COMM-BAT in RotT?
There are nine different Modes (or games) you can play in Comm-Bat mode.  Only
three of them are available in shareware.  The other 6 are registered only.
They can all be played in Team mode, except "Tag".  When you play in team mode,
everyone with the same color will be on the same team.  Capture the Triad has
a limit of two teams.  Every other game can have as many teams as you want,
with the exception of TAG, which cannot be played in Team Mode at all.

¯ NORMAL - This is just you and your buddies blasting each other into
           oblivion.  There are no special parameters for this game, and
           everyone is your enemy.  Shoot at will!

¯ SCORE MORE - This is very similar to NORMAL, with one notable exception.
               You get more points for more difficult kills.  The different
               point values you can get are:

               1 point  - Killing an enemy with a missile weapon on the ground.
               2 points - Killing an enemy with a bullet weapon on the ground.
               2 points - Killing an enemy with a missile in the air.
               3 points - Killing an enemy with a bullet in the air.
               4 points - Crushing someone (ie: standing on their head).

¯ COLLECTOR - In this game, the object of the game is to collect more
              "Triads" than your opponent(s). There are small colored Triads
              scattered throughout the levels, and you need to collect more
              than your friends to win.  There are no weapons in this game.
              This game is very well suited for young children.

¯ SCAVENGER - This is very similar to Collector, except that there are
              weapons in this game.  You can shoot at your opponents as they
              try to get the Triads.

¯ HUNTER - In this game, one player is the "Prey".  This player will be
           unarmed.  It is everyone's job to find that player and kill
           them.  A player is prey for a defined amount of time (this time
           is declared by the Master).  At the end of that time, the
           prey becomes a hunter, and another player is then chosen to be
           the prey.  During play, the Prey will have no weapon on their
           screen.  That picture and screen name of the Prey will be in the
           upper left side of the screen, so that everyone will know who
           the Prey is.  The person with the most amount of points wins the
           game.  If you are playing hunter in team mode, then your entire
           team is "Prey" at the same time.

¯ TAG - In this game, one person at a time is defined as "it".  This player
        is denoted in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  If you are
        "it", it is your job to run up to another player and tag them.
        You tag someone by going up to them and pressing the 'use' key (by
        default, this is the space bar).  Once you tag that person, they
        become "it."  One point gets added to their score, and it becomes
        their responsibility to seek out other players and tag them.  The
        person with the lowest number of points at the end of the game will
        win.  This game cannot be played in team mode.

¯ ELUDER - In this game, you chase roving "Eluders" (they look like small
           coloured Triads - similar to the objects in Collector).  Your object
           is to tag them by running up to them and pressing the 'use' key.
           Each one you tag earns you a point.  The person with the most points
           at the end of the game wins.

¯ DELUDER - Very similar to ELUDER, except that you need to destroy the roving
            "Eluders" instead of tagging them.

¯ CAPTURE THE TRIAD - In this game, you play teams (if there are only two
                      playing, it is two teams of one).  Each team gets a Triad
                      to protect.  It is the object of the other team to steal
                      your Triad from your home base and take it back to their
                      home base.  This is the only mode of ROTT that has to be
                      played in team play.

Troubleshooting Multiplayer Connections
MODEM/SERIAL
þ If you have trouble connecting at higher rates, try a lower port
  speed.  These are not actual connect rates, these are port opening speeds.
  We recommend you start at 9600, and then go from there to see what levels of
  port speed you can successfully connect and play at.

þ When you play Rise of the Triad via modem/serial, you will note a line of
  text that reads "UART is a ..."  This will either be 8250 or 16550.  If you
  have an 8250, it means that you have a slow serial chip, and you may be
  prone to modem jerkiness and other game slowdowns.  Apogee strongly
  recommends a 16550 or greater serial chip, since these have larger buffers
  and can deal with the influx of data better.  If you have a 16450, it will
  be detected as an 8250, since a 16450 is virtually identical to an 8250.
  Also, software driven 16550 ports will most likely not be properly detected.
  You will need a "real" 16550 port in order to have it detected as such.

þ If you have an 8250/16450 and experience slowdowns, try these steps to
  speed things up:

  ¯ Make sure you are using 8 Bit Mono sound.  16 Bit Stereo sound sometimes
    makes things go slower on certain system configurations.

  ¯ Try setting the number of voices from 8 down to 4.  If this doesn't help,
    keep trying to lower the number of channels down until you get something
    that is acceptable.

  ¯ Try with all sound and music off.  If it is still slow, then the problem
    lies elsewhere.

  ¯ Make sure the init string you are using is correct for your modem.  Quite
    often, incorrect strings will cause VERY slow game play.

þ Slowdowns during game play can be caused by several things.  It can be your
  modem string, or it can be something simple like a bad phone connection,
  general bad phone lines in your area (or your opponents), or an 8250 chip.

þ If you are the person making the call, you are player one.  You will be
  the "Master", and will be the one choosing the battle parameters and options.

þ If you experience modem flakiness after connecting once, you might wish to
  physically turn your modem off and then back on again.  Some modems do not
  reset properly, or react better if you switch them off and then on again. If
  you have an internal modem, try resetting your system by pressing the reset
  switch on your computer or by powering down, waiting a few seconds, and
  powering back up again.

þ The MODEM.PCK file is a standard ASCII file.  You can edit this as you
  desire, but you must follow the convention that is used in the file.  If you
  alter the file format, you may not be able to pick modems properly.  Please
  see the notes in the MODEM.PCK file for editing information.
NETWORK
þ If you get the error "Unknown Packet During Setup" when launching the
  server, it means that someone who was playing a previous game using
  that server is still in the game.  Ensure that everyone has exited and
  is at DOS before starting the server.

þ If you launch as a client, and the server is not found, this means that
  something has become unsynced.  At this point, ensure that every computer
  is at the DOS prompt before launching the server.  It also helps to reboot
  all computers playing ROTT before attempting to play.  If possible, make
  ROTT the first thing you run after rebooting.  This can help in certain
  memory/computer configurations.

þ It is possible to play more than one game on a network at one time. However,
  you can not START more than one game at a time.  In other words, if your
  party wants to play NetROTT, and there is another group playing the game,
  then you will have to wait until all of them are in the game and playing
  before any of the second group can start.  To start another game while one
  is in play, you need to make use of the "Change Socket Number" option in
  the setup program.  Please see your local network administrator for more
  information regarding what to use here.

þ If you are getting an error where the game finds more players then there are
  actually playing, make sure all players are on the same LAN, everyone is
  booted clean, and try a different socket value.

þ If you are playing a network game, and you get the error message "IPX not
  detected", it means that you haven't loaded your IPX protocol.  This will
  need to be loaded before any ROTT programs are run.  Please ensure that the
  IPX protocols are loaded before running the setup program.

    [7-8]
Multiplayer Options
There are many different options you can select to alter RotT's Comm-Bat
play.  Here is a description of them.

¯ GRAVITY - You can select Low, Normal, or High.  Normal is pretty Normal.
            Low gravity can make it seem like you're flying, and it will
            take a long time for anything to fall to the ground.  Low gravity
            makes it easier to get objects in the air (including the other
            players in the game).  High gravity makes things fall like a
            rock, and it is very difficult to get objects in the air that are
            in hard to reach places in this mode.

¯ SPEED - You can select either Normal or Fast.  In Fast mode, the players run
          very fast, and it is a bit more difficult to control this way.

¯ AMMO PER WEAPON - You can select One, Normal, or Gunfinity.  In Normal, you
                    have the regular number of shots per weapon.  In One, you
                    only get one shot per weapon, and then the weapon goes
                    away.  In Gunfinity, there are an unlimited number of
                    shots per weapon.  Be warned that Gunfinity makes it very
                    easy for a player to sit in a corner and defend their
                    position, creating a very unfair advantage.

¯ HIT POINTS - You can alter the number of "hit points" per character.   You
               can select one of the options listed, anywhere from 1 to 4,000.
               At one, you take one hit from any weapon, including the pistol,
               and you die.  On the other end of the spectrum, having 4,000
               hit points makes it very difficult to kill someone unless you
               have Gunfinity or God Mode.  You can also select "By Character"
               which means each character has their normal number of hit
               points as defined by their abilities.

¯ RADICAL OPTIONS - These options radically change the game play of Comm-Bat.
                    You can control whether things respawn, and how powerful
                    they are.  Here is a listing of what they are.

   Spawn Dangers - This controls whether you will get items such as firejets,
                   boulders, spinblades, etc.
   Spawn Health  - If you're daring, you can play the level without health.
   Spawn Weapons - This controls whether you want weapons in the level.  If
                   you choose this, there will not be any rocket weapons.
   Spawn Mines   - If you turn this option on, it will turn all the health
                   in a level to mines, which are very painful to run over!
                   (Mines are not in the shareware version of Triad.)
   Respawn Items - This controls whether you want items such as the vests
                   to reappear after they've been picked up/used.
   Weapon Persistence - Normally, when you pick up a weapon, there is none
                        left behind.  If this is switched on, the weapon will
                        still be there after you pick it up.  Furthermore, you
                        cannot drop your weapon (this is done by hitting your
                        'delete' key by default) with this switched on.
   Random Weapons - Normally, a specific weapon will appear in the same place
                    every time.  If you turn this on, there will be different
                    types of weapons appearing each time you play.
   Friendly Fire  - If this is turned on, you will lose points if you kill
                    yourself playing solo, or your team will lose points if
                    anyone on your team kills themselves or another teammate.
                    If this is turned off, then you can kill your own teammates
                    or yourself and you don't lose any points.

¯ LIGHT LEVELS - There are 6 levels of lighting you can choose from.  They are
                 Dark (everything is dark), Normal (as defined by the level
                 designer), Bright (everything is really bright), Fog
                 (everything has a foggy look to it), Periodic (this means the
                 light level pulsates during play), and Lightning.

¯ POINT GOAL - You can choose from a variety of point goals.  You can choose
               1, 5, 11, 21, 50, 100, Random (the computer makes one up),
               Random Blind (the computer makes one up but doesn't tell you),
               and Infinite (play till the cows come home).  If you reach a
               defined point goal before the time you chose expires, your
               game will end.  Also, if you are playing with Random Blind, you
               cannot press TAB to see everyone's Killcounts.

¯ DANGER DAMAGE - You can control how much damage the various hazards in the
                  level cause when you hit them.  You can choose Normal, Low
                  (not much damage at all), or Kill (you instantly die when
                  you hit something).

¯ TIME LIMIT - You can choose how long your game will last in minutes.  You
               can select from 1, 2, 5, 10, 21, 30, 99, and NONE (play till
               the cows come home).  If you reach the selected time limit
               before you reach the point goal you selected, your game will
               end.

During Comm-Bat play, there are some extra features that are not available
when you are playing the game by yourself.  They are:

¯ RemoteRidicule - You can press F1 through F10, and a sound will play on the
                   computers of your opponents (assuming they have sound
                   cards).  Imagine the fun of walking up behind someone who
                   doesn't know you're there, and making his computer say
                   "Behind Ya!", and then whack him in the head with a
                   baseball bat!

¯ Live RemoteRidicule - If you have a Sound Blaster or 100% compatible, you
                        will be able to speak live to all other players in
                        the game by plugging a microphone into your Sound
                        Blaster and pressing F12.  What you say will be
                        transmitted to all the others in the game.  Only one
                        player at a time can use this function.  Please note
                        that this option is only available in network play.

                        Please note that while Live RemoteRidicule can be
                        heard by everyone, you need a Sound Blaster, Sound
                        Blaster Compatible, or Pro Audio Spectrum in order to
                        record (transmit) sounds that everyone else can hear.
                        If you have a sound card that's supported by ROTT, but
                        is not specifically listed here, you will not be able
                        to transmit messages using Live RemoteRidicule.

¯ Messages - You can send text messages to other players, too.  If you want to
             send a message to everyone, depress the "T" key, and then type
             away.  When you're done, press ENTER, and your message will be
             transmitted to everyone.  If you want to send a message to a
             specific person, you need to depress the "Z" key.  After you type
             in your message and press ENTER, you will be shown a list of
             people playing.  You can then select whom you want the message to
             go to.

¯ Macros - If you want to send messages, but you don't want to type the same
           messages over and over again, you can make use of the Macro system.
           Macros are set up in the setup program (see the section on using
           the setup program for more info).  When you're playing, you need
           to press "T" or "Z" like a normal message, but after that, you can
           press ALT-x where x is a number key between 1 and 0 on your keyboard
           for your macros.

¯ Viewing - If you are playing in team mode, you can press the "9" key to look
            through the eyes of your teammates.  Continue pressing "9" to
            scroll through the views of all of your teammates until you return
            to your own.

When you are playing ROTT by yourself, the F5 key will change the detail level,
and the F7 key will turn messages on and off.  These can still be accessed when
playing Comm-Bat RotT, but you need to use the Shift key as well.

Level Editing with RottED
        [8-1-1]
What is RottED?
    RottED is a RotT level editor/creator made by Wayne Sikes.  It is
currently the only such editor for RotT.  RottED is for Windows.
        [8-1-2]
Where can I get RottED?
    You can get RottED by FTP from:
        spectrum.com.au     /games/Rott/
There is also a link to it(and another editor) from the Rott Page:
http://www.swcbbs.com/apogee/rott.htm
        [8-1-3]
How do I use RottED?
    Once you've gotten RottED to run properly, the obvious question is how
to make levels using RottED.  I'm going to abbreviate RottED to RE for the
rest of this section.  The first time you run RE, you're going to be confused.
If you double-click on a tile, you'll see a screen that will really confuse
you, since you don't have the vaguest idea what a "Sprite Plane" is.
Well, first, you should print out a listing of all foreground and background
tiles.  To do this, go into help, pick Foreground Tile Summary, and then
choose File...Print Topic.  Do the same for Background Tile Summary.  Now,
I'm going to show you a glossary for RottED.
    PLANE - A field where data is stored.
    SPRITE - Any interactable object, such as an enemy, a health item,
             a powerup, a touchplate, etc.
    WALL - In RottED, Wall can mean an actual wall, a door, or a floor area.
    TILE - In the editing screen of RottED, you will see a large grid.  Each
           separate rectangle in the grid is a TILE.  Each TILE contains
           information.
    SPRITE PLANE - Each tile has a sprite plane where information about
            sprites on that tile are stored.
    WALL PLANE - Each tile has a wall plane where information about what floor
    pattern, wall, or door is on that tile.
    INFO PLANE - Each tile has an info plane where special information about
    that tile is stored.
The grid you see in the editing screen is actually a top-view of the map
you're going to create.  However, there is an area of the editing screen
which is not a physical component of the map you're going to create.
The first 5 tiles in the top row if the map contain critical information
for that map.  These five tiles determine:
The height of the map you wish to create
The light level of your map
Environmental effects such as fog and lightning
The ceiling pattern of your map
The song that will be associated with your map.

Until you become more familiar with RottED, I suggest that you start
each map by pressing CTRL-C.  This will make RottED load some default
values to the critical tiles.

Now, to begin creating.
I suggest that you use the RottED tutorial that is included with RottED,
but I will include a short tutorial here.

Creating A Room
First, start RottED and make a new level.  For it's name choose
"FIRST.RTL".
To make a room, you need an area bounded by walls on four sides.  This is
easy.  First, choose what you want your wall to look like by picking a
value from the background tile summary printout(see, you really SHOULD
have printed it out).  I usually use number 23.  Then, double click which
tile you want to be the upper-left corner of your room.  Put 23 in the
wall plane space and press OK, but FIRST remember which tile you are
modifying(the tile's coords are on the top of the screen).  Then, pick
up the wall data from that tile by holding down the W key and clicking
on the tile.  The cursor should change from the standard mouse pointer
to a text-editing like cursor.  Now, click and drag a straight, horizontal
line across the screen, make it at least 8 tiles long(remember which tile
you ended at).  Now, click and drag a vertical line down from the
tile your horizontal line ended at.  Now, another horizontal line going
to opposite from your first and going the same length.  Finally, a vertical
line going up to the very first tile you edited.  Do you follow?  Though
you can't see it, you've made a rectangular area bounded by the wall tile
you chose:

     (Your first tile)
             |
            \|/  LINE 1
             X---------------X
             |               |
             |               |
      LINE 4 |               |LINE 2
             |               |
             X---------------X
                 LINE 3
If you want to see this area, choose View...Tile Brightness, then click
on Default Tile Brightness, then OK.  If your area is deformed or the walls
have "holes", try again.  Now press END.  This takes you out of the "COPY
WALL DATA" mode.  Now, you need a floor.  Put your mouse cursor in the
middle of the area you created, and hold down the F key while you click the
left mouse button.  This brings up a screen with all the background tiles.
Choose a floor tile by clicking on it, a good one is the white tile with
the "X" through it.  Now, as you can see, your area's floor has been covered
with the floor you chose.
Now, you need to add a vital piece of info, and that's a first person
starting point.  Choose a tile to start at and double click on it.
In the SPRITE PLANE space, put the value 20.  This is a first person start
facing east.  Now, choose another tile that you want to be an end-level tile.
Double click on it and put the value 107 in the SPRITE PLANE.  Next, on
that same tile, choose the box that says "Level Info" and put the value 0.
Press OK.  You should see that the tile you selected for an exit has a red
X and a red 0 on it.  This is because there aren't any other levels in this
RTL, so when you hit the exit tile, you'll go back to the beginning of
the first level.
Now, save your level.
Move your level to the ROTT directory and enter setup.  Choose the "Alternate
Stuff" option.  Next choose the "Alternate Game Levels Option", highlight
your level's filename, and press the spacebar.  Go back to the main
menu and "Save and Run Rott".  Start a new game.  You should be in your level.
You should now be able to use the RottED tutorial to add new options.
Here's one thing that RottED doesn't mention, however:
To make an elevator, you need to first create the boundaries.  It should
look Like this:
                +-----------------------+
                |ELEVA- |ELEVA- | WALL  |    Make this elevator where
                | TOR   | TOR   |       |    you want it, and make
                | WALL  |WALL   |       |    one exactly the same(with
                +-----------------------+    The Same Number Tile) where
                |ELEVA- |NUMBER | ELEV- |    You want it to exit.
                |TOR    |TILE   | ATOR  |    That's how it works.
                |SWITCH |(90-97)| DOOR  |    An elevator with a Number Tile
                +-----------------------+    Of 90 will exit to the
                |ELEVA- |ELEVA- | WALL  |    other elevator with the tile
                | TOR   | TOR   |       |    of 90.
                |WALL   | WALL  |       |
                +-----------------------+
TIPS FOR LEVEL CREATING(AND ERRORS):
In Comm-Bat levels, don't make things too complex.  Mark Dochtermann
implemented a new packet transfer technique for modem play, but
it still can't be TOO complex.
All life items(and items in general) should be obtainable.
Show the player something they want, but create a barrier they
must overcome.
Never create a place where the player can't get out; and if you
do, make sure they can kill themselves.
When you create an important item, put a touchplate in front of it
that dumps enemies all over the player, but don't do this too often.
Try to use themes.
In COMM-BAT, never have a super-defensible weapons "pick-off-the-other-guy"
location.  Or, if you do, always provide a non-horribly-hard way to
pick off the waiting person.

What are .RTC and .RTL files?
    Files with a ".RTC" extension are COMM-BAT files.  Files with a
".RTL" extension are regular game levels.

don't HAVE to, but just show a little consideration and do so.  A sample

Notes: There are 21 levels in this pack.  This is a listing of all the
       level designers.  All levels in this pack (with the exception of
       the "This Causes an Error" level were originally created for use
       in Rise of the Triad.  For whatever reason, these levels were not
       used, and since they were just lying around, we figured we'd just
       throw them out in the public for free for whomever wanted to play
       them!  Here's a list of all the levels in this pack, who designed
       them, and notes on a few of them.

01) Use the Fish -> Designed by Joe Selinske
    Fans of the Keen IV game might recognize this level.  If you rename this
    file to rejects.rtl, and look and use the map cheat to see the whole map,
    you should recognize this map.  :)

02) Wan Fife -> Designed by Joe Selinske
    Fans of id Software's Doom might recognize this level.  Thanks to John
    Romero of id Software for the inspiration for this level.

03) The Pound -> Designed by Tom Hall
    This level is spent almost entirely in Dog mode.

04) Valhalla -> Designed by Tom Hall
    The idea behind this level is to knock the other guy off the side of the
    level with a Godball.  Woe be the person who isn't in God mode.

05) Aztec Paramecium -> Designed by Joe Selinske

06) Death Box -> Designed by Tom Hall
    For those people who complain about large levels.  :)

07) Battle Squid -> Designed by Joe Selinske

08) Great Wally -> Designed by Tom Hall & Joe Selinske

09) Lumpy's Delight -> Designed by Joe Selinske

10) Pillar Killers -> Designed by Joe Selinske

11) Red Rum! Red Rum! -> Designed by Joe Selinske

12) Barreling Down -> Designed by Tom Hall & Joe Selinske

13) Spears of Density -> Designed by Joe Selinske

14) Balconexus -> Designed by Joe Selinske

15) Spinblade Runner -> Designed by Tom Hall & Joe Selinske

16) Five Windows -> Designed by Joe Selinske

17) Storm's Eye -> Designed by Tom Hall & Joe Selinske

18) Skylands -> Designed by Joe Selinske

19) Speed -> Designed by Joe Selinske

20) Twin Falls -> Designed by Joe Selinske

21) This Causes an Error! -> Designed by Joe Siegler
    This level was thrown on at the last second.  If you rename this
    file to REJECTS.RTL, and load it up as a regular level file, and not
    a Comm-Bat level file, you'll have some fun in this level.  Keep in mind
    that this level is a joke, and the error created is intentional.

                          the idea was dropped.  I had forgotten about it
                          until now, so I decided to release it on my own. :)

The Creators
                       THE DEVELOPERS OF INCREDIBLE POWER
We got our name from a memo of Tom's about work hours.  At the end, it read:
[some text about working together well, and if we do...] We will be...
The Developers of Incredible Power!  It kind of stuck after that.  We don't
mean it to be bragging--we mean it to have a sense of humor about ourselves.
So many companies take themselves so bloody seriously all the time.
Anyway, here we are....

WHO                TITLE               WHAT THEY REALLY DID
Tom Hall           Creative Director   Designed game. Did most of levels.
                                       Drank lemonless, spoonless iced tea.
Mark Dochtermann   Head Programmer     Wrote engine, comm code.  Ate a lot of
                                       Chinese food, and looked weirdly into
                                       the air at times.  Flew many sad
                                       (sometimes leaky) airplanes.
William Scarboro   Programmer          Wrote actor code.  A lot of it.  Also
                                       has this thing for buddah and pushing
                                       buttons in elevators with heads.
Jim Dose'          Programmer          Wrote sound code, some menu code.  Also
                                       locks keys inside his running car when
                                       outside of liquor stores.
Stephen Hornback   Artist              Did most of the wall textures, most of
                                       the actors, the cool explosions, most
                                       of the items in the game, & the Apogee
                                       earth background.  Dreams of working on
                                       Cosmo 6D with a Pink Floyd soundtrack.
Chuck "D9" Jones   Artist              Did the snake door, tech door, some
                                       cinematics, and the Game Over picture.
                                       Has this incredible talent of hiding
                                       from people at pool parties and making
                                       them look silly!

                              ASSOCIATE DEVELOPERS
                        These people helped us out a lot

Lee Jackson        Our master musician won a world-championship pun-off. Three
                   times.  Also spent a lot of time pining for the fjords. (Not
                   fields or fiords.)  Fnord.  Ruh.  Warp.
Joe Selinske       He did a bunch of battle levels and some game levels, also
                   spent too much time eating sushi and watching Japanimation.
                   Later went on to wear very silly hats with horns on them.
Joe Siegler        He did some game levels, including several that really make
                   people mad like "The Vomitorium".  Drinks Diet Coke like
                   most people inhale air.  Also wrote the ROTTHELP file.
Robert Atkins      He did the awesome printed manual for Dark War, and admired
                   Princess Leia in a "special" way.
Marianna Vayntrub  She did some game levels in Dark War, Krist's chair, Mark.

Troubleshooting
þ Apogee strongly recommends that you consult your hardware and software
  manuals for your system before you make any suggested changes to your
  current system setup.  Your manuals will tell you if you are about to
  make changes that may irreparably alter your computer or its
  configuration.  Modifying your system or software can be dangerous if not
  done properly.  Apogee will not be able to assist you with any problems
  resulting from such modifications.

þ If you get the error "Get Static for Index", it means your game data has
  become corrupt.  Run SCANDISK (if you have MS-DOS v6.20 or higher) or
  CHKDSK /F (if you have any other DOS version - see your DOS manual for
  instructions), then delete the game and reinstall.  If the problem persists,
  it's possible your disks have some bad data; obtain another copy.
þ If your copy of ROTT locks up randomly and you have a sound card, you might
  be experiencing a DMA conflict.  These are caused by having more than one
  hardware device sharing a DMA (Direct Memory Access) channel with your sound
  card.  DMA channels are used by ROTT to send sounds to your sound card.  When
  you have more than one piece of hardware on a single DMA channel, the chip on
  your motherboard that controls DMA transfers may become confused and send the
  sound to the wrong place.  When this happens, your system will lock up.

  Devices that usually cause DMA conflicts include CD-ROM drives, older
  dedicated FAX boards, tape backup drives connected to an accelerator card
  (not including tape drives plugged into your floppy drive controller cable),
  and in newer systems, the ECP/EPP parallel port on your I/O card or on the
  motherboard itself.  If any of these devices are present on your system, they
  may be the source of your lockups.

  DMA conflicts cannot usually be spotted by diagnostic software (e.g., PC
  Tools SI.EXE, Norton Utilities NDIAGS, etc.).  Apogee does not recommend the
  use of such software to determine if you have a DMA conflict.  Instead, if
  you suspect a DMA conflict, try the following test:

       1.  Run the SNDSETUP program and select NONE for your Sound FX card.
       2.  Play ROTT and watch for lockups.

  If the game no longer locks up, then you were definitely experiencing a DMA
  conflict between your sound card and some other device.

  The ONLY way to resolve a DMA conflict is to physically move the conflicting
  device to another DMA channel.  In all but the rarest cases involving devices
  that "download" their configuration at boot-up time, you cannot do this
  through software.  You also cannot solve the problem by simply unloading the
  driver for the conflicting device.  Since this is a true hardware conflict,
  the problem can persist even if the device driver is not loaded when you boot
  your machine. In laymen's terms, booting clean won't solve the problem.  You
  will most likely have to move a "jumper" (see your manuals for a description)
  to physically reconfigure the conflicting device.  If you need assistance
  with reconfiguring your device(s), please consult your system's manuals or
  contact the manufacturer of the device(s) in question.  Apogee Software
  cannot provide assistance for reconfiguring your hardware.

  For best performance, do not move your sound card to a different channel:
  leave it where it is (usually channel 1 for 8-bit cards, or channels 1 and 5
  for 16-bit cards).  Instead, move the conflicting device.  After you have
  resolved the DMA conflict, you may re-run the SNDSETUP program and re-select
  your sound card under the Sound FX setup.

  If your copy of ROTT still locks up, you may wish to check some settings in
  your CMOS configuration as a last resort.  If any of these are on, then
  switch them off:   Hidden Refresh, Hardware Video Shadowing, Turbo Switching.
  Also, if you have either of these, turn them on: HD1 Block Mode; IDE HDD
  Block Mode.

þ If you have a Diamond SpeedStar video card, disable Zero Wait State.

þ If you hear static when you are playing with a Sound Blaster or
  compatible card, make sure to turn the MIC and LINE volumes to zero.
  Your card may be seeing input from these, resulting in static.  For a
  Sound Blaster Pro, the program that adjusts these is called SBP-SET:  see
  your card's manual for precise instructions on how to do this.  If you
  still continue to hear static after doing this, try disconnecting any
  parallel port devices.  IRQ5 and IRQ7, which are used by sound cards, are
  often frequently used by printers as well.  If you have both plugged in,
  the result may be static and poor sound performance.

þ If you are running a Compaq computer with a VGA card and the game tells
  you that you do not have a VGA card, or if you experience lockups on a
  Compaq computer with a VGA card, you will need to contact Compaq for a
  special video driver.  The reason for this is that Compaq has some video
  cards that do not conform to all proper detection methods.  There is a
  device driver available from Compaq that will fix this problem.  The
  driver's name is FINDVGA.SYS.  This file used to be available on their BBS
  with the filename of SP0117.ZIP, but as of the writing of this document,
  it is not available.  Please contact Compaq if you cannot locate the file

þ If you are playing with a joystick, and your performance seems erratic, make
  sure to calibrate the joystick inside the ROTT program.  Also, check and
  make sure that the joystick port you are using for ROTT is speed adjustable.
  If it is, then try tinkering with the speed.  If it is not, then there may
  not be anything you can do to alleviate the problem, short of buying a game
  card that provides speed adjustable game ports.  Check your port's manual for
  more info.  Also, make sure you do not have more than one active joystick
  port on your machine at any time.  If you have a game card that provides two
  game ports, make sure that no other game ports (such as those on a sound card
  or I/O card) are active.
þ Help!  My Space Player is not recognized by ROTT!
  The reason for this is that you must tell ROTT that you have this controller,
  and you're using it.  This is done with the SPACEBALL command line parameter.
  Please see the section on Command Line Parameters for more info.

þ Help! My Cyberman is not recognized by ROTT!
  The reason for this is that you must tell ROTT that you have this controller,
  and you're using it.  This is done with the CYBERMAN parameter.  Please see
  the section on Command Line Parameters for more info.

þ Help! My Wingman Assassin is not recognized by ROTT!
  Yup.  You guessed it.  You need to tell ROTT that you have this type of
  controller, and that you're using it.  This is done with the ASSASSIN
  command
  line parameter.
þ If you get an error that starts with either "FX SETUP ERROR", "MUSIC
  ERROR", or some other error that has "sound" in the error, it means that
  something is awry with your sound setup.  Delete the SOUND.ROT file in
  your game directory and re-run the SNDSETUP.EXE program that comes with
  ROTT.  Make absolutely sure that you select the proper sound card, since
  an incorrect selection can cause errors.  If this doesn't work, try
  reinstalling the game.

þ If you have a GUS and you are not getting sound effects, or if your GUS
  sound effects are scratchy or distorted, make sure your GF1 IRQ is set to
  7 or lower.  This is controlled by the SET ULTRASND= command in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  A sample of this command line would be:

                        SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,7,5

  The next to last digit on this line (the 7, in this example) is your GF1
  IRQ.  This number must be 7 or less for ROTT to operate properly.  If it
  is higher than 7, you will need to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT and change it
  to 7 or lower.  Save the change, exit your editor, and reboot so that the
  change will take effect.

þ If you get an error that starts with "Z_Malloc", or get "Max Precache
  Reached", it means that you are having memory problems, usually due to a
  lack of memory available for ROTT.  Make sure you are booting without a
  memory manager, or things like disk caches that take up valuable memory
  that ROTT needs to run properly.

þ If you get an error that says "Different number of Pushwalls/Doors/etc when
  trying to load a savegame", it means that either your map data or your save
  game has become corrupt.  Go to the load save game menu, and delete the save
  game in question.  If this doesn't solve the problem, reinstall ROTT.

þ If you are playing a net/serial/modem game, and you get an error that has
  "Player x is unsynced at ...." it means that you had bad packets or otherwise
  had a bad connection.  Quit the game in progress and try again.

þ If you get an error that says "Illegal Load Game Value", it means your save
  game is corrupted.  Either save over it, or delete it.

þ If you have an AWE32 Sound Card, and get the error "MPU-401 Initialization
  Error", you will need to turn your computer totally OFF, wait about 5-10

  seconds, and then turn it back on again.  Delete SOUND.ROT, and try
  reselecting your music/sfx again.  This error is caused by picking incorrect
  settings; if you pick the wrong settings for an AWE32, you need to power
  down and retry, not just reboot.

þ If you have an AWE32 Sound Card, and get the error that the AWE32 card is
  not being detected when you try and select music, do the following steps
  to set up AWE32 music:

  1) Do a full reset of your computer; this means totally powering down, and
     then restarting your computer (just in case the AWE32 is in a bad state).
  2) Set up sound fx by running SNDSETUP.EXE. Do not setup music at this time.
  3) From the DOS prompt, type "EDIT SOUND.ROT". (Or use your favorite text
     editor; SOUND.ROT is an ASCII file)
  4) On line 19, you should see the following: "MusicMode          0".
     Change this to read "MusicMode          5".
  5) On line 76 you will see settings for the Sound Blaster.  They will look
     something like this:

;
; Sound Blaster Settings
SBType             6
SBPort             $220
SBIrq              5
SBDma8             1
SBDma16            5
SBMidi             $330
SBEmu              $0

     On the line that say "SBEmu", change the number that follows from "$0"
     to be the same as the number following the "SBPort" parameter (in this
     case, "$220").  For this example, you would have:

;
; Sound Blaster Settings
SBType             6
SBPort             $220
SBIrq              5
SBDma8             1
SBDma16            5
SBMidi             $330
SBEmu              $220

  6) Save the file and exit to DOS.  ROTT should now be able to detect your
     AWE32 properly.  If you still have trouble, then you may have incorrect
     values for the ports on your sound card.

þ If you notice the game running slowly on your system, here are a few
  suggestions on improving game performance.

  ¯ Disable your disk cache.  Since ROTT does its own internal caching,
    external caches get in the way.  This can result in anything from slow
    performance to complete lockups.  Disk caches also take away memory that
    the game could use to operate more efficiently.

  ¯ Disable your upper memory manager (QEMM, 386Max, EMM386, etc).  Since
    ROTT is a protected mode game, the services of these programs are not
    needed.

  ¯ Turn the option for "Auto Detail Adjust" on.  This will adjust the graphics
    level of the game on the fly, and will attempt to keep the game moving at
    a fast speed all the time.  When you hit a snag, or a possible slowdown,
    ROTT will bump the graphics level down a bit until things speed up again,
    and then will adjust the graphics back up.

  ¯ Try reducing the screen size.  When playing the game, you can press either
    '-' to reduce your screen size, or '+' to increase it.

  ¯ Turn off the ceilings and floors.  This will usually speed things up
    considerably, since the game will not have to draw or keep track of any
    ceiling or floor graphics.

  ¯ Try reducing the amount of digital channels that you have set for sound
    effects.  Some system configurations have problems with having ROTT set
    for higher than 4 digital channels.

  ¯ Try reducing the mixing selection on your sound card from 16 bit to 8
    bit.  This is done from the SNDSETUP.EXE program, under the "SETUP
    SOUND FX" menu item.  8 Bit Mono is the fastest music/sound combination
    there is in ROTT, so if you have slowdown problems, try selecting 8
    Bit Mono.

Secrets in the Game
(from the Apogee FAQ)
If you start ROTT when your system clock indicates that it's one of five
different holidays, the "group picture" of the five main characters is
changed slightly.  In addition, on Christmas, the music for the first
level is changed to a familiar Christmas tune.  The holidays and effects
are as follows:

   Easter             <varies>    Lorelei Ni wears Easter Bunny ears.
   Cinco de Mayo       05/05      Ian wears a sombrero.
   Independence Day    07/04      Doug holds an American flag.
   Halloween           10/31      Thi wears a witch's hat.
   Christmas           12/24      Taradino wears a Santa Claus hat; new music
                       12/25      for the first level.

Also, there's a way to get all five "holiday hats" in Rise of the Triad to
show up on the screen at the same time.  If you finish the game the right way,
and destroy all the larvae in the last level, watch ALL the credits (takes
several minutes).  You'll get to a screen that says "The HUNT is victorious.
The End."  Do nothing.  Let it sit there for about a minute or two, and
you'll get another "The End" screen where all five "holiday hats" are shown
at once.

In the secret level "Eight Ways To Hell" (episode 3, area 8), designed by
Joe Siegler (a noted and revered Dopefish follower), there's a hidden area
about half way through the level.  It's a long, narrow hallway with
boulders running down the middle and elasto-modes on the sides.  There's
a touchplate at the beginning of the hallway which, when triggered, will
open up a secret room.  The gray walls in the middle of the secret room
spell a message written in the Commander Keen language (see the Keen
secrets section, below).  Look at all the gray walls from all angles, or
use the \MAP cheat (see the cheats section).  Then look at the map to see
the letters.  Translated, it says, "Dopefish Lives!"

Bosses play big roles in Rise of the Triad.  There are four, one at the end
of each episode, and arranged in order of weakest to strongest.  There are
ways to kill two of the bosses that the programmers at Apogee never thought
to try.  These "loopholes" are "fixed" in version 1.3 of ROTT, but version 1.2a
and previous versions still have the loopholes.  For Sebastian "Doyle"
Krist, you can lure him out of the room by hitting the touch plate diagonally
away and to the right of the gold door as you enter it.  The triggering the
touchplate will block the gold door and open a passageway.  Lure Krist
through here carefully, then through the brown door.  Then go up the
staircase!  Krist, in his wheelchair will follow you up.  However, due to
a bug in Krist's programming (he was never intended to ascend stairs), he
won't fall back down to the ground.  He'll fire missiles at you, but with
you safely beneath him, they won't hit.  Shoot him until he's dead.  You can
also lure the NME out of the room he starts in, but if he's led into the
nearby spinblades, the game will crash.

The second loophole involves the final boss, El Oscuro, in his final form
(the snake-like form).  Get a firebomb and an asbestos vest.  Then find
El Oscuro and lure him into a corner.  Keep the corner at your back.  Aim
the firebomb down and fire it -- this will thrust you up into the air.
Land on El Oscuro and wait for him to exhaust himself.  (The intended method
of killing him is to not fire at him at all, but dodge his own attacks until
he dies of exhaustion.  Firing at him simply makes him stronger!)

Several people have run across the curious message "I'm Free" while playing
ROTT, and don't know what it means.  If you get this, you're probably playing
either the "This Causes An Error" level in the registered version, or you're
playing a user-made level.  The cause of the note is whenever a moving wall
crosses the boundary of a level and just keeps on going.  The game detects the
problem, but, before crashing with a regular error message, manages to put up
the picture saying, "I'm Free" (drawn by Tom Hall).  The "This Causes An
Error" level, originally titled "WanderWall Bug Map," has a pushwall in it
that leaves the level, crashing the game with the "I'm Free" message.
In the rejected ROTT levels (ROTT_REJ.ZIP), there is a level called "This
Causes An Error Too."

What all this is, is a manifestation of in-house humor.  If you don't get it,
that's good, because you're not supposed to.  It's one of those "you had to
be there" things.  At any rate, the story goes...during the development of
ROTT, when a level was tested wherein a pushwall was inadvertantly directed
out of the level bounds, someone joked, saying, "I'm free."  He probably
wishes he hadn't, for all the confusion it's caused customers who have run
across it -- either that, or, if he were more like me, he feels a deep sense
of satisfaction in having successfully dumbfounded a significant enough
percentage of the gaming community to warrant mention in FAQs such as these.
