Here is what I compiled from severeal news groups.
I'd be very happy if someone would take over for me and make it
some kind of frequently asked questions list (FAQL) which could be sent
to other people on request.

Some information about 1WOLF3D of APOGEE:

	Jamie Walsh (jwalsh@aspentec.com) [6 May 92 12:58:45 EST]

	Apogee just released Wolfenstein 3D.  I saw it in uploads of
	Channel 1 BBS yesterday, presumably uploaded by Scott Miller
	of Apogee. I called Software Creations BBS voice phone, and
	sysop Dan Linton confirmed that it was genuinely released two
	days ago with the filename #1wolf3d.zip.

	It requires VGA and a 286 or better CPU to run.
	Being of a violent nature, and showing bloody graphics, 
	Apogee gave the game a parental warning rating of "PC-13."

	Stephan Petersen (IFF291@DJUKFA11.BITNET) [7 May 92 12:40:33 GMT]

	I've heard that this game violates German law and can't
	therefore be distributed by the German representatives of
	Apogee, nor should it be uploaded to a German ftp site or
	bulletin board. I haven't seen the game and can't judge
	whether these measures by the German authorities are
	appropriate, but if it's illegal to use/distribute it in
	Germany it's not because of "nothing". Please kindly consider
	the above when mailing or uploading to German sites as this
	might cause trouble for the system administrators.

Sites:	(Anonymous ftp)

	wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/1wolf3d.zip
	info.umd.edu:info/Computers/PC/AfterHours/Recreation
	ftp.ulowell.edu(129.63.32.1):/msdos/Games/Apogee/1wolf3d.zip

	The program has also been posted to comp.binaries.ibm.pc.archives.
	It consisted in 15 parts. Decoding it yields
	"1wolf3d.zoo" [size: 651701 bytes].

Sound:

	Loss of sound after encounter with a dog:
	F4 and ESC.

1WOLF3D on OS/2:

	No special sounds like gun firing:
	Use sounds option (F6). 

	Settings:
	Try turning HW_TIMER on and VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION off.


Video:

	Some paradise cards and the video board built into the Dells card
	support the split screen mode needed to pull of the effects.
	The programmers are looking into a fix.


	"The score numbes and status areas are all messed up."
	This is due to a problem with the images in latch memory.
	Apogee is working on it.

	"The game messes up one way or another. I am using QEMM 5.11."
	Upgrade to QEMM 6.0 or higher.

	"The game hangs when I'm blasting around the levels.
	Especially when I'm in a long hall."
	You can't see it, but you got a divide by zero error.
	It's been noted and the next version will correct the problem.

Play:

	If a door won't open then you must have missed the key.

	If there's a pool of blood on the floor, you can "SLUUURRP" it.
	Interesting sound effect.

	"How do you kill that big guy that says 'Guten Tag!' ?"
	You can kill him in one pass if you have the heavy machine gun.
	After you open that door, backu up immediately, like you should
	ALWAYS do, and hold down the fire key.


	Edward Lee (edlee@chinet.chi.il.us):

	The following trick is old news, but it may be worth mentioning
	here.  When you travel through a maze like the ones in this game,
	you can use the strategy of moving through the maze as if one of
	your hands were always on a wall.  This will get you through the
	entire maze except for the rooms whose walls are not directly
	connected with the rest of the maze walls (ignoring the floor and
	ceiling).

	The reason this strategy works is that you can imagine the entire
	maze as one elastic surface, a bubble.  You can squeeze the bubble
	and make a long corridor, then stretch out different parts of the
	corridor to make other corridors, and so on.  When you look at the
	final maze, it may bear little resemblance to the original bubble,
	but all of the walls that were formed from the original bubble are
	still connected to each other, continuously.  When you keep the same
	hand on the wall at all times while travelling through the maze,
	you will eventually come back to where you started from.  This is
	easiest to see in the case of a maze with just one corridor.  This
	traversal method is known as the depth-first search strategy.  It
	is one of the strategies used in computer programs to visit all
	the nodes (rooms) in binary trees and in other similar graphs.

	In Wolfenstein 3D, there are sometimes small, isolated bubbles
	within the larger bubble of the maze.  So, for these, you may want
	to temporarily switch hands.


Cheat:

	Start the game like this:

	WOLF3D /TEDLEVEL #

	Where # is the "level number" or "level name".

	# := "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" |
		"boss" | "secret"
	
	Note: # = "0"  has the same effect as # = "1".

	Remark:
	This switch also works with KEEN 4, although it's buggy.
	When you finish the level, or if you try to quit the game,
	it hangs (on my computer anyway).

	You can get directly to level 10 by finding the secret door on
	level 1 near the elevator.  There are two secret doors inside
	of that secret area. One has a secret elvator, and another had
	an extra man once.
	But there is a program that prints out the maps for all levels:

	Bill Neisius (bill@solaria.SCG.HAC.COM) [15 May 92 14:21:59 GMT]
	There is a program called WMAP21.ZIP on wuarchive.wustl.edu in
	/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS that prints maps for all 10 levels of W3D.
	Also  included on the maps:  First aid kits, Ammo, Food, Guns,
	Keys, Treasure,as well as Dogs, and Guards (both kinds).

	Larry Hastings	(funkster@cats.ucsc.edu) has announced
	[17 May 92 09:36:29 GMT] a slight change of this program.
	It will now print the level maps in standard ASCII.
		

	Bill Kirby (bkirby@cs.umr.edu) [16 May 92 03:35:00 GMT]
	Wolfenstein 3-D graphics editor:
	First, kudos to the author of that WMAP program.  I've been
	digging around in that d*mn maptemp.wl1 file for about a week
	now and couldn't figure anything out. I've had a LOT more fun
	trying to figure out these file formats than actually playing
	this game.  :-)

	Anyway, I have a program that lets you edit the 64x64 pixel
	graphic images that are "texture mapped" onto the walls.  The
	file VSWAP.WL1 contains graphics for both the wall images and
	the guards, etc.  But I haven't figured out the way the guards
	are stored, so you can't do anything with them yet.

	The program requires VGA (duh) and a mouse.  It's not very clean,
	but it works.  If there is enough interest, I'll clean it up a
	bit and upload it to wuarchive.

	Jeffrey Michael Bryer (umbryer@ccu.umanitoba.ca) [Thu, 14 May 1992 20:18:11 GMT]
	Wolfenstein 3D - Map Update(4):

	Due to popular demand I have made the PostScript verision of my
	maps available.  The PS version is courtesy of George Dolbier
	(georged@sequent.com) and is simply a conversion from the PCX
	format to Encapsulated PS.

	As a bonus the files are roughly the same size but (of course)
	PS compresses much nicer than PCX where the PCX zoo archive is
	167KB the PS zoo archive is only 37KB.

	Both formats are available at ccu.umanitoba.ca in pub as
	1wolfmap.zoo.ps  for the PS  version
	1wolfmap.zoo.pcx for the PCX version

	Are people still interested in an ascii version of the maps
	(now that the size of the files has been greatly reduced due to
	the use of PS)?  I realize that not all people have access to PS
	printers and I have not seen the quality of printing that the
	maps have on dot-matrix or inkjet printers.

	Once our scanner is accessable again (May 26) I will add levels
	4-10 and get them converted to PS.



Troubleshooting

Memory:

	We had problems on some machines that used QEMM memory management.
	Wolfenstein writes directly to video memory, and QEMM was trying to
	move it, or only recognized part of the video RAM and had put
	high-RAM in some areas.  It ran okay without QEMM loaded.
	Apogee is working on fixes.
