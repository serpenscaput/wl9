1.0 THE WOLFENSTEIN NOVICE QUESTIONS

1.1 WHAT IS WOLFENSTEIN?

Wolfenstein-3D is a 3-dimensional action game from Id Software.
(distributed as shareware by Apogee)

OBJECTIVE: survival/exploration

TYPE: action

VIEW: first person 3-dimensional perspective.

FEATURES: Smooth scrolling gameplay and character animation.
          Full 360 degrees view sweep at any angle.
          VGA graphics (300x200x256), SB/SB-Pro/Adlib/Sound Src support
          Mouse/Joystick/Gravis pad/Keyboard interface.

DIFFICULTY LEVELS: 4

VIOLENCE RATING: PC-13 (profound carnage - analogous to the movies' PG-13)

COMMENTS: Impacts visually. Highly addictive.

STORY LINE: Basically you're a WWII allied spy imprisoned in Germany and
            you're trying to escape (full story included with the game).

AVAILABILITY: First part is shareware. Extra parts can be ordered from the
              distributor (more later)

STAGES: 6 episodes (parts) each containing 10 levels.
        The shareware version only contains episode 1.
        The registered version (pay $$$) contains either 3 or 6 episodes.
        Altogether there are 10, 30 & 60 levels in the shareware and
        two registered versions.

WARNING: Some people have reported being sick after playing or watching
         others play (a kind of motion sickness if you like).
         --> See 4.7

1.2 WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO RUN WOLFENSTEIN?

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
         Processor: 80286 or better.
         Graphics:  256Kb VGA or better.
         Memory:    600Kb Conventional. Also supports EMS, XMS.
                    (Well, it reports it. Don't know about using it.)
         Hard Disk: Approximately 1.38Mb (Shareware version)

OPERATING SYSTEM & COMPRESSION UTILITY COMPATIBILITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DOS        : 5.0, 6.0 (Don't know about earlier versions)
Other OS's : OS/2,
             Windows: (Note if you've got a SB device driver
                      installed under windows or a windows TSR
                      like an hour chime running it may interfere
                      with some of Wolfenstein's digitized sounds)
             Windows NT: unknown.
             DR-DOS 6.0

Compatible with: Stacker: Yes (2.0 & 3.0)
                 Superstor: Yes
                 DOS 6.0's Double Space: Yes

1.3 WHERE CAN I GET IT FROM?

You can ftp it from ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca (130.179.16.24), locating it in
/pub/wolf3d . It is either archived as a PkZip's ZIP file (wolf3d14.zip) or
a self-extracting archive (wolf3d14.exe).
Another ftp site is ftp.uwp.edu (131.210.1.4), in /pub/msdos/games/id as
wolf3d14.zip.  (note: ziped with PkZip v2.04g)
It is up to you whether you get the .zip or .exe archive but you must have
PkWare's PkUnzip software to unzip the .zip file if you choose that.
The archive size is approximately 750Kb.
There is an unpacking installation with this latest version (v1.4) so there
should be no problem with getting started.

You can also get a full version from Apogee (Id's Wolfenstein distributor).
Info on ordering is included in the shareware version.

1.4 HOW DO I UNPACK IT?

If you've obtained the .zip archive then you'll need PkWare's PkUnzip software
(version 2.04g) to 'unzip' the file.
Create a spare directory, then copy the file you've obtained into it.
Next use pkunzip to unarchive the file. Like so:
pkunzip wolf3d14.zip
(Assuming your pkunzip is on DOS's command path.)
If you've obtained the .exe then just copy it to a spare directory of your
choice and run it by typing its name.

1.5 HOW DO I INSTALL IT TO HD?

Through unarching the program in 1.4 above, an INSTALLATION copy of the game
was placed in the current directory. Just run INSTALL program supplied to
install a runable copy on your HD.
You can delete the INSTALLATION copy once a runable copy has been made
(to save disk space of course).
NOTE: Initially you'll need ~4Mb of HD space to unpack and install the game.

1.6 CAN I PLAY IT FROM FLOPPY DISK?

You can play the shareware version from floppy disk since it's only about
1.38Mb (we're talking 3.5" High Density disk here). You'll have to install it
to a hard disk first and then copy it across to a floppy disk.
The full registered version of Wolfenstein is much too big for a 1.44Mb
(unless you have something like a 20Mb floptical disk drive :) on which it
would easily fit).
The performance of the game running from a floppy is much the same except when
you first load it up it takes it about a minute to load up all the graphics/map
info, so just wait patiently. It's a bit slower between the levels as well.
In the game itself there is usually no speed differential except in certain
parts where it brings in a page of graphics for some wall panels. You can then
notice a split second pause.

1.7 WHAT'S WITH THE VERSION NUMBERS?

The most current version of Wolfstein 3D is 1.4. The newest version fixes all
known bugs (as did 1.1 etc.) Apart from that there is not much of a difference
unless it comes to map/graphics editors --> See 1.8, 1.9 & 2.X
A breakdown of the versions and what the differences are is below
(If you never played Wolfenstein this will sound meaningless, but then again
 if you NEVER played Wolfenstein then where were you this past year? ;)
NOTE: There may have been some other bugs fixed between the versions which I
      don't know about, so if you think you know e-mail me.

v1.0 - First release (05/05/92)
v1.1 - Fixed some secret doors map bugs (on level 7 & 8 in episode 1 there
       were secret doors left out) (06/10/92)
v1.2 - Secret level elevator bug was fixed (introduced in 1.1 :( ) (06/22/92)
v1.3 - Was never released.
v1.4 - Fixed something but I forgot what. It also changed the graphic backdrop
       on the opening screen and other menus, changed the interior elevator
       graphic and added a calibration routine in the joystick setup menu.
       (12/03/92)

The dates next to versions are the file stamp dates of the game files. They are
not the actual release game dates.

There were other 'internal' changes between versions but they are only relevant
to mapping programs -> See 2.X

1.8 ARE THERE MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS AVAILABLE, AND WHERE?
    WHAT ARE THEY? AND WHICH FILES DO THEY CHANGE?

Map/Graphics editors can be obtained from the same ftp site as the game.

No, they are not written by Id or supported by them.
Yes, they will be ok for your own use (for now anyway).

READ THIS! IMPORTANT!  READ! THIS! IMPORTANT!  READ! THIS! IMPORTANT!
****************************************************************************
Id at the moment is in no position to endorse/condemn these utilities. The game
distributor, Apogee, though has a different view on the matter. They claim that
because of their existence their sales of the game may be potentialy reduced.
This is because there's tons of already existing free levels for the shareware
episode which may withold potential customers from registering the game for $.

This is Id Software's official word on this matter.

August 5, 1993

Id Software speaks on Apogee's restriction of WOLF3D add-ons.

We have to bow out and allow Apogee to protect themselves in the marketplace.
If they are threatened by these add-ons they have every right to follow the
path that they feel will best protect their business.

[Quote off]

If at some point in time Apogee take stronger action we may see these utilities
'outlawed'. Until such time though I will not reserve myself from including the
information about these utilites and their products in this article. Nor have I
seen any statement from Apogee advising the public it should abstain from usage
and exchange of these software.
*****************************************************************************
Ok continuing on...

You can even share with the world your own map/graphics creations for
Wolfenstein by uploading it to ftp.uwp.edu in /pub/incoming/id .
(--> See 1.9 for a complete list of Id's directories for that site.)

NOTE:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are strictly not allowed to distribute the executable files from the game.
i.e.  any .exe or .com (I don't think there are .com files with it anyway). Nor
anything from the game for $ unless selling the game to third party (Legitimate
registration transfer).

The editors have been obtained by reverse engineering the map/graphics files
and producing programs that changed those files in a manner consistent with the
game requirements of them.

The editor archives are:
maped41.zip        map viewer/editor
wolfed21.zip       graphics viewer/editor
wolfm160.arj       map viewer/editor version convertor

The last one will let you convert between different versions of Wolfenstein
since the map encryption for 1.0 is not compatible with 1.1 and upwards
(and you may feel left out if you designed maps before with 1.0 and now have
 1.1 or 1.4 etc. Not so!
 BTW: 1.1 through to 1.4 are map/graphics compatible as known to date.)

Also maped41/wolfm160 will automatically detect what version of Wolfenstein
you have installed so you need not worry if you don't want to convert maps
(upgrade/downgrade (!) them).

All of these files include ample docs with them, if you already have them and
want some tips or help on their differences and shortcomings then
--> See 2.X

The aforementioned editors change the following files:

Map editors:
MAPHEAD.XXX
MAPTEMP.XXX
GAMEMAPS.XXX
where XXX is either .WL1 for the shareware version or .WL3 and .WL6 for the
registered 3/6 episode versions respectively.
Note that GAMEMAPS.XXX replaced MAPTEMP.XXX in versions of Wolfenstein 1.1 and
higher, i.e. MAPTEMP.XXX is only present in v1.0. It doesn't really make any
difference since the map editors will recognize that.

Graphics editors:
VSWAP.XXX
where XXX is as before.

1.9 ARE THERE DIFFERENT SETS OF READY MADE MAPS/GRAPHICS FILES, AND WHERE?

If you are looking for an alternative set of map or graphic files for your
Wolfenstein game then the same sites mentioned above carry them as well in the
same or sibling directories.
For example ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca has the add on maps/graphics/editors etc. in
the same directory as the game i.e. /pub/wolf3d .
Make sure you look through an index file (normally 00index* or README to see
what is what or --> See 5.1 & 5.2 for a short tour)
Another site is:
ftp.uwp.edu [131.210.1.4]     Id "Official" anonymous FTP site
/pub/msdos/games/id           Id games
/pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew Id games' great add-ons
/pub/incoming/id              Upload dir

1.10 HOW CAN I CHEAT IN WOLFENSTEIN?

There is a document on ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca in /pub/wolf3d called wolfdbug.txt
that describes the various cheat options in Wolfenstein and how to access them.
I have reproduced it here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!


THE WOLFENSTEIN 3-D DEBUG MODE FILE

(v1.0 means Wolf3D version 1.0 and v1.1 means Wolf3D version 1.1.
The other versions are the same as v1.1 except as noted.)

To enter the mode, do the following:

1.  Invoke Wolfenstein 3-D with the "next" parameter (wolf3d -next)
    for v1.0, or the "goobers" parameter for v1.1.  You can also use
    whatever other command-line parameters you want.

2.  Begin or restore a game.  While in the game, hold down the TAB,
    CONTROL, and ENTER keys simultaneously for v1.0, or the LEFT SHIFT,
    ALT, and BACKSPACE keys for v1.1.  You should get a message stating
    that debugging keys are now available.

That's it!

To use debugging mode commands, hold down the TAB key and one of the
letter keys listed below simultaneously:

B   Changes the screen border color.  Don't ask me why it's here, but
    it's here.

C   Displays the number of statics, doors, and actors in the level.
    Statics are things like food, ammo, pools of blood, etc., and actors
    are the bad guys.  Doors should be self-explanatory.

E   Moves you ahead two levels.  That's right, not one level, but two.
    Unlike the W command (see below), this also takes you to the "level
    completed" screen and gives you percentages, bonuses, etc.

F   Displays your current position on the level (X,Y) and orientation (A).
    To convert the X and Y values to coordinates that can be used in
    MapEdit, divide them by 65,536 and round down.  A is in degrees
    ranging counterclockwise from right.  ("Right" refers to the top
    view as seen in MapEdit.)

G   Turns what Id calls "GOD mode" on and off.  Basically it just means
    that you're invincible.  The screen still turns red when you would
    normally be hurt, though.  This can get very annoying if you want to
    do something fun like kill the episode's boss with your knife.

H   Hurts you (-16% health).  Not much use to us, but I guess Id had to
    debug their damage code just like everything else.

I   "Free items."  Ups your health, ammo, and score, and gives you the
    next most powerful weapon.  (Machine gun if you didn't have it,
    Gatling gun if you did.)

M   Displays memory usage.  Loads of fun.

N   Turns "No clipping" on or off.  This lets you walk through walls.
    Wall-walking does STRANGE things to the graphics (try approaching a
    door from the side and opening it).  It also does strange things
    to the bad guys.  If you walk into a room through the wall, often
    they won't notice you at all, even if you walk right in front of
    them or fire your machine gun (in some direction besides at them,
    of course).  This command is not available in the registered version
    of the game.  (I guess we should be glad that ANY of the commands
    are available.)

O   Changes the main viewscreen to a map of the current level, which
    you can scroll through using the movement keys or the mouse.  It's
    neat, but I wish that it weren't so ugly.  Those numbers are from
    the internal level format.  ESC will get you out.  Unfortunately
    this command doesn't work in v1.1.

P   Pauses the game, without putting up the little "Paused" window.
    I guess this makes it nice for taking a screen shot, although in
    v1.1 it changes the screen border to an ugly bright white.

Q   Bombs the machine in v1.0.  Exits the game in v1.1.  Both of these
    functions are about equally useless.

S   Turns slow motion on or off.  If you have a slow computer you don't
    need this.

T   Pops up a window which displays graphics and sounds from the game.
    Use the left and right arrow keys to page through the entries.
    If you come to a blank entry, keep going.  You'll know when you've
    reached the end (500-something) because you won't be able to go
    any higher.  ESC exits.  v1.1 has some interesting graphics that
    v1.0 lacks, including two sprites which are particularly intriguing.
    Don't bother calling Apogee and making yourself look like a fool
    only to be told that you didn't win anything; I already did.
    (You'll understand what I mean when you've seen the sprite.)

V   Asks you how many extra VBLs you want.  High values seem to make
    the game sluggish and not much else.

W   Warps to any level.  Although it prompts for a value from 1 to 10,
    you can actually enter any number up to 20 in the registered
    version.  Eleven through twenty correspond to levels one through
    ten in the episode following the one you're currently playing.

X   "Extra stuff."  Doesn't appear to do anything.  If you can amend
    this, let me know.

Miscellaneous notes:

TEDLEVEL - You can use the "-tedlevel" command-line parameter to quickly
start Wolf3d and warp to any level.  The parameter is followed by a
two-digit number.  The tens digit is the episode number minus one, and
the ones digit is the level number minus one.  For example, to go to
level 10 of episode three, type:
    wolf3d -tedlevel 29
and to go to the first episode, level 2, type:
    wolf3d -tedlevel 1
By default, you will play the level on the "Don't hurt me" difficulty
setting.  To change this, use one of the command-line parameters "-baby"
"-easy" "-normal" "-hard".  They stand for the obvious difficulties.
Using the "-tedlevel" parameter also gives you an infinite number of
lives.  Combine it with "-goobers" (or "-next") for even more fun.

DEMO RECORDING MODE - This "debugging" feature is not accessed in the
same way as the other commands, and it is available only in v1.0.  To
record a demo, follow step one from the beginning of this file, and
then hold down TAB at the title screen (the one with B.J. hiding from
a guard).  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to display
these demos after they've been recorded, but if you've ever had a
secret desire to play Wolfenstein 3-D with a big "DEMO" sign at the
top of the screen, this is how to do it.

SPEAR OF DESTINY - Strictly speaking, this file isn't about SOD, but
SOD's debugging mode is quite similar to Wolf3d's.  Just use the
command-line parameter "-debugmode" and the same key combo as v1.1.
Oh, and be sure to check out what happens to B.J. when you turn on
God mode...

2.0 MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS SECTION (IF YOU'RE MESSING AROUND WITH MAP/GRAPHICS
    FILES THEN THIS SECTION IS FOR YOU).

2.1 DISCUSSION OF AVAILABLE MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS.

There are 3 editors available as far as I know. Only the most recent versions
are reviewed below.

a) MAPEDIT v4.1 - Map editor.

b) WOLFMAP v1.6 - Map editor/version convertor.

c) WOLFEDIT v2.1 - Graphics editor/extractor.

Mapedit - Written by Bill Kirby (who incidentally retired from working on his
          creation).
          This software will let you edit Wolfenstein's maps for any version
          released to date (1.0 through to 1.4). It will recognise if your copy
          is shareware / 3 episode or 6 episode.
          Turbo Pascal source is included so you can make your own adjustments.

Wolfmap - Written by Jan Peter Dijkstra (Sysma Atomatisering).
          This one was based on Mapedit but then evolved into an editor of its
          own. It's really more of a Wolfenstein map processor with functions
          such as: version conversion, level map export into intermediate file
          (allows moving and copying of levels), level ASCII dump for printing
          purposes etc. The editor is really based on Mapedit visually with
          slightly more functionality. C++ source included.

Wolfedit - Written by Bill Kirby (again!). This is a must if you want to change
           Wolfenstein's graphics. Not only does it let you edit the wall
           panels as well as images of guards and various objects. You can also
           export/import images as GIF files. This makes editing with your
           favorite paintbrush tool easy. The picture size is limited to 64x64
           pixels but for importing images you can position a square on a
           larger image and snap it into the editor.

2.2 RULES TO FOLLOW WHEN EDITING.

Here's a few guidelines if you're just starting to play around with the
editors. I thought I'd put something down that might save you from screaming
ARGHHH!! after a few hours of editing. Most of these are just a few pointers.

- First of all save your work often. This one needs no explanation.
- Also test it often. Some editing quirks will produce game bugs that are just
  plain hard to get rid off. That might mean you'll have to start editing that
  level from scratch.

Mapping hints:
        - Elevator exits should be east/west (or left/right). Otherwise they
          won't work properly. This is because the elevator object is different
          from other objects in the maze which have all sides the same.
        - Secret elevator needs floor number 6c (hex) to work properly.
        - Mobile guards can have arrows (turning points) to direct them. Place
          these on the path you want them to move. When they notice you they'll
          obviously break from that pattern, otherwise they'll follow it.
        - Number of objects on one level is limited to approximately 500.
          Secret doors and guard guiding arrows are NOT objects.
          Actors ARE objects too.
        - Number of actors (guards/dogs etc.) on one level is limited to
          approximately 150.
        - Number of doors (sliding doors NOT secret doors) on one level is
          limited to 64. This includes unlocked, locked and elevator doors.
        - Don't include objects in shareware maps that are only available in
          non-shareware episodes. This will cause a problem when Wolfenstein
          tries to refer to these objects as parts of the graphics VSWAP.WL1
          file. For example you can't have Hitler in the shareware version of
          the game unless you copy the bitmaps across from the graphics files.
        - It is wise to surround the level grid by a thin strip of walls. If
          you don't do it there's no telling what wall will you see at the edge
          of the map.
        - Don't forget you need an entrance to a level.
        - You also should have an exit or game end trigger (see level 9 of the
          shareware version to see how it's done.)
        - The exit must be the elevator icon unless you changed the graphic.
        - Exit from level 9 leads to level 10. Thus you can have 10 straight
          levels with no secret level.
        - Secret doors can "collapse" onto one another. Thus if you have many
          secret doors in a row with only the first secret door positioned over
          a wall you can repeatedly push the same wall panel.
        - Too many guards in one room will result in the disappearing bodies
          phenomenon. --> See 6.3
        - Only guards over the same floor as you will hear you shoot your gun.
          Since this concept is quite important to game strategy here's a
          little explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you fire your weapon (this does include the knife but only if you poke
someone) in a room then all the non-deaf guys in the same room who stand/walk
over the same floor values will hear you. That is they will become active and
try hunt you down.
Also guys in other rooms which are not connected to your present room at the
moment (What I mean is the doors between that room and your current room where
you are are closed) will also hear you if they stand/move over same floor value.


This allows for a variety of dynamic effects,  e.g. see below:

   1               2                 3
------------------------------------------------
   G1   G2|        G4           |     G5
          |                     |
          #        G3           #
   Y      |                     |
          |                     |
------------------------------------------------
^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^            ^^^^^^^^^^^
room             room                room
with             with                with
floor            floor               floor
 A                B                   A

Here's a quick sketch of 3 rooms connected by sliding doors #.
You (Y) are in room 1.  Rooms 1 & 3 have the same type of floor.  Room 2 has
a different type of floor.  G1-G5 are guards.
If you shoot your weapon in room 1 then guards G1, G2 as well as G5 will
become aware of your presence (G1 & G2 probably are already aware of you if
they saw you).  G5 will run from room 3 to room 2 (tracking your position in
straight line).  Eventually he would get to room 1.  If you fire your weapon
while either of the doors are open then G3 & G4 will will become aware of you
too.
NOTE: You didn't open either doors (I'm assuming G5 or G3 or G4 does that)
      unless you ran for it ;)

The first floor value in the Mapedit/Wolfmap editor index is the DEAF floor
(this should be annotated in either editor).
The guards standing on deaf floors will react only if you pass within their
sight (that seems to span slightly less than 180 degrees (~90 either side of
their face)).

Note that if you mix floors in one room (other than the DEAF floor) then only
the floor which connects to the door through which you entered will become
active.  Guards standing on other floors will be oblivious to you unless you
shoot at them (not sure if you can run through them)

In a way when you enter through the sliding doors a change of active floor
takes place (after the door shuts --> while it's open both floor values are
active).

A classic example is when you enter a room through a secret door.  If the
floor in that room is different then no guard in that room will respond to
you shooting.

        --> See later part of 2.5

2.3 COMMON EDITING ERRORS (WHAT NOT TO DO AND WHAT THEY'LL PRODUCE).

        - You forgot to put an entry position into a level.
          When you start that level you'll find that you can't move around and
          you see walls in all directions.
        - You put too many guards in one level.
          Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
          that level:
          'GetNewActor: No free spots in objlist!'
        - You put too many objects in one level.
          Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
          that level:
          'Too many static objects'
        - You put too many doors in one level.
          Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
          that level:
          '64+ doors on level'
        - You included in your shareware episode map some objects used in
          non-shareware episodes only.
          Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering
          that object/wall comes into your view:
          'Tried to load sparse page'

        - One more error which I cannot attribute to anything I know can occur.
          It happens when you die for the first time on a level. Wolfenstein
          kicks out with this message:
          'MM_GetPtr: Out of Memory!'
          This can occur in spite of the fact that the level has few actors or
          objects and there's plenty of RAM around.
          If you know how to fix it or what the cause is let me know.

2.4 MAP/GRAPHICS FILES VERSION CONVERSION.

Map files version conversion:
        Wolfmap 1.6 can convert between any version of Wolfenstein map files.
        Maps for versions 1.1 and higher are considered equivalent.
        Note though that not all wall panels map directly to the same panels
        through this conversion. In particular the false door of v1.0 has been
        removed and after conversion to v1.1 will appear as a mud-wall which
        will cause you problems if the maps were only the 1-episode shareware
        which doesn't have the graphic for that wall.
        In short: don't trust the conversion. Look through the maps carefully
        to see if something has gone wrong. I suspect some objects are
        converted to 'unknown' objects as described by the editors.

Graphic files version conversion:
        No known convertors exist. If you know one let me know.
        Yes, that does mean you'll have to import all the walls etc. as GIFs
        into the version of the file you want.

2.5 EDITORS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE GAME AND EACH OTHER.

Mapedit, Wolfmap and Wolfedit are compatible with all versions of Wolfenstein
from 1.0 to 1.4 shareware and both of the registered releases.

Wolfmap is compatible with Mapedit, but Mapedit is NOT compatible with Wolfmap.
That is, files processed by Wolfmap are not readable by Mapedit.

Sometimes the objects edited do not always appear as they should. An example is
missing sliding doors when they were placed in the map. The door vacancy is
present instead but you cannot move through it. This seems to be either a game
bug (that's questionable though) or map format misconception by the map
editors. Someone suggested that this can by fixed by changing floor values next
to the object/door in question. You can also move the door to another place on
the wall. I know it may stuffup your design but it should help.
NOTE: Placing a deaf-floor by the door will always make it invisible. For some
      reason v1.0 of Wolfenstein experiences more of these problems (?).

Wolfedit has no major problems with wall panel graphics. There are some
problems when it comes to objects such as lamps, dog food guards etc. It seems
each object has a 'size' parameter. Editing the object may overrun that limit.
Graphedit won't let you save the file if any objects are at fault. Curiously
even editing the colour (shade) of an object may adversely affect it. Most
importantly though objects need to have blank background. This is denoted by
bright pink background colour in the Graphedit editor. (Have a look at some
standard objects that came with Wolfenstein.)

2.6 HOW TO MAKE A HARDCOPY (PRINTOUT) OF THE MAPS.

I recall there are three ways.
1) Use printscreen key + graphics.exe program under DOS to capture the screen
   of one of the map editors.
2) Use Wolfmap's ASCII map dump feature. Then print it as any file. There are
   also other utilities for that. --> See 5.3
3) Capture map screen under Windows and print it later (costly on ribbon or
   toner since in bitmap mode)
NB: If you only want maps to original Wolfenstein then there are some already
    made. --> See 5.3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.2 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFICULTY LEVELS OF THE GAME?

There are three main differences:
1) There are more guards on harder difficulty levels.
2) They are harder to kill (can take more shots and you have to aim better)
   on harder difficulty levels.
   NB:        on the lowest level 'Can I play Daddy?' you can generally pick off 
a
        guard even at long distance with one shot in the general direction
        (well, not every time but often). On the hardest level this usually
        will not happen.
3) On harder levels you take more damage when shot.

There is another minor difference. On the lowest level the first aid kit
sometimes bumps up your health more than on other harder levels.
--> See 3.6 for more.

3.3 WHAT ARE THE SECRET ROOMS/DOORS IN THE GAME? HOW CAN I FIND ONE?

The secret rooms are like any other room in Wolfenstein except they are
accessed by a 'secret passage' (not really a door). There are certain wall
panels which can be pushed (acted on) like a normal door. The wall will then
slide back revealing a passage to another room. Secret rooms are usually used
to store treasure, food, first aid and ammo packs and more powerful guns, i.e.
the items of interest when survival at stake (the treasure helps get more
points which accumulate to extra lives etc.). Sometimes they are used to store
keys to locked doors, but not often (not in shareware episode anyway).

Although there are no strict guidelines to where a secret room might be you
can get some slight hints on where one might be positioned. Since the maps in
Wolfenstein are true (i.e. they're not warped space) then if you see a block
of wall which is pretty thick and has no standard rooms (operated by normal
sliding doors) it could potentially house a secret room. Try first the obvious
places on the walls e.g. Hitler's painting, nazi banner & other obvious wall
decorations. Some secret pannels are in the corners of a room, others in the
middle of a wall (midpoint of a wall in a standard room). There are also a few
between two objects, like between two plants or two barrels positioned against
the walls. --> See 4.10 for more.

3.4 WHAT IS THAT FUNNY OBJECT/SPRITE IN THE GAME?

That funny object only occurs in the registered 3 or 6 episode version of the
game. It is a sign saying to call Apogee. See, it was going to be a part of a
competition with the game, like you find it and then call the distributor
(Apogee it was then) and you could win something (???).
The competition idea was dropped fairly quickly though, after all the mappers
and editors were unleashed only weeks after game's release.

3.5 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CODES LISTED AT THE END OF GAME STATS?

Same thing as in 3.3 the code is the checksum for your score in game. It was
going to be a proof that you actually went through the game and obtain such and
such score.
NB: To my knowledge the codes only occur in v1.0 & 1.1 (maybe 1.2 not sure)

3.6 ARE THERE GHOSTS IN WOLFENSTEIN? IF SO WHERE? CAN I KILL THEM?

There are two kinds of ghosts. The Hitler's ghosts which haunt you in episode 3
level 9 (the boss level where you kill Hitler). You can certainly kill those.
There are also some funny Pacman Ghosts in episode 3 level 10 (secret level).
You can't kill those but they can hurt you if you touch them. Just stay clear
and you'll be ok. (or cheat with GOD MODE --> See 1.10)

3.7 WHAT DO OTHER OBJECTS APART FROM AMMO, FOOD ETC. DO?

Umm, well...nothing really. They're there 'cause they look nice.

Here's a short list of all the usable objects:
Ammo clip: gives you ammo (duh)
Machine guns (Schmeisser & Gatling gun): increase your firepower.
Chinken meal, Dog food, Blood pool, Bloody skeleton & First aid kit:
extra health
Cross, Challace, Treasure chest, Crown: points
Sphere with your face on it: extra life + health + ammo

Doors: open and close these.
Keys: access locked doors.

3.8 I'VE HEARD YOU CAN DRINK BLOOD IN WOLFENSTEIN? IS THAT TRUE? HOW?

You can slurp up the blood pools and consume the bloody skeletons if your
health falls below 11%.

3.9 ARE THERE ANY MORE CHEATS/HINTS AVAILABLE?

Yes Siree! There's certainly that Wolfenstein hintbook you can obtain for some
extra $ ($10 U.S. I last heard), when you order the full version of the game.
It's supposed to be packed with hints about the game levels and how to cheat in
the game (--> See 1.10). I don't know all the details 'cause I don't have it.
(Er, the game's too easy anyway (No flames! --> See 4.X))

3.10 THE STATISTICS & RECORDS SECTION (NUMBERS ABOUT THE GAME).

Ok, at the risk of repeating myself here goes:

        treasure statistic!

Average number of rounds required to kill:
Dog: 1
Brown guard: 2
SS trooper: 5
White officer: 3
Undead: 3
Ghost of Hitler: 25
Boss: 80 (except for Adolf Hitler: first some 70 to blast him out of his harness,

                                   then another 70 to finish him off)


4.0 THE FLAMING SECTION. (YOU'RE ANNOYED WITH WOLFENSTEIN BECAUSE...)

4.1 IT CRASHES.

Usually the reasons for Wolfenstein bombing out are these:

1) You have a hardware conflict with your soundcard.
2) You have a software configuration problem.
3) You have more than one version of Wolfenstein and some game files from the
   versions are mixed.

1 & 2 are discussed under sections 6.1 & 6.2

If you mixed Wolfenstein versions or put different home-brew add on maps in the
same directory then Wolfenstein might hang since map and graphics file formats
are different from version 1.1 onwards.

4.2 THE SOUNDS ARE ALL SCREWED.

Either your card is not fully Soundblaster compatible or you have IRQ or DMA
conflict. --> See 6.1

4.3 YOU ARE LEFT WITH A GUN AND 8 BULLETS AFTER YOU DIE.

Solution
a) Cheat (--> See 1.10)
b) Learn about secret rooms and how to find them (--> See 4.10), there is
   plenty of ammo inside them.
c) Save often.
d) The SS blue troopers carry machine guns. Toast one with your gun and you can
   pickup his machine gun.

4.4 IT'S TOO HARD.

--> See 4.3 & 4.10
Also start on easy difficulty level. Don't despair, you'll get better. One of
the advantages of veteran players is that they know the layout of the maze.
They know where to find ammo, food etc.
As you get familar with the game you'll also be able to judge how many shots to
fire and where to aim. Thus you can conserve your ammo.
To preserve health learn how to use the strafe function (useful when ducking
around corners)
Also don't just plunge into rooms. Hang back and see if any guards come running
out. Then .... Pang!
Some difficulty can also be attributed to disorientation of new players.
Several corridors or rooms may look alike. Try look for dead bodies (i.e. the
trail that you've left behind) or other characteristic objects.
If you're having trouble with movement then --> See 4.6 & 4.7

4.5 IT'S TOO EASY.

Like a challenge eh? Check out some home-brew maps. --> See 5.1
You might also try to reduce your health with the cheat mode (--> See 1.10)
or decide to play without machine guns. Take that for a challenge.

4.6 YOU KEEP RUNNING INTO THE WALLS AND MISSING THE DOORS.

Sounds like a major new user disorientation syndrome to me, but could also be
attributed to slow computer. See, slower machines sacrifice the frame rate to
keep the gameplay speed constant. Thus you might miss a few frames here and
there and that will fool you into overshooting your targets (doors, guards when
you're aiming your pistol at them etc.) Strafe function helps here sometimes.
You can also try experimenting with various input devices. Mouse is more
accurate on position but slower when it comes to movement. Joystick is rather
inaccurate but easy to handle and still slow. Especially your rotation speed.
If you have a Thrustmaster or other joystick + configurable buttons you can
program these for strafe & run functions. That should make it a little easier.

4.7 YOU ARE FEELING DIZZY WHILE YOU PLAY IT.

There have been a lot of discussion about this phenomenon. In short some people
experience dizziness attributed to the game movement. There were many theories,
most along the line of motion sickness.
Some also said that the animation is too smooth so it fools your brain into
believing it to be real. Others said its too jerky and it makes you vomit like
being sea sick. Another popular theory is that lack of proper acceleration
(like on-off high speed) attribute to the nausea.
I will not go into discussion of why. Rather I'll post some steps people
suggested. Remedies are not guaranteed to work. There are many, all are
experimental and some will have opposite effects on different people. This, it
seems, is a very individual problem.

a) Try different display sizes. Either different size monitors or use the F5
   function to vary the display window.
b) Try sitting closer/further from the display (but don't stick your nose in
   it, I don't want you to get radiation sick). Combine with focusing/
   defocusing on the display or surroundings (your room etc.) This is to see
   if you're being aware that you're looking at the monitor (by seeing other
   objects around it) and hopefully it may convince your brain that what you
   play is not really real.
c) Try different machine speeds. If you have a turbo switch try playing with
   it on/off. See what the difference is.
d) Play on your friend's/collegue's computer. See if it's better/worse.
e) Have breaks while you play. Play in turns. Watch others play & then play
   yourself.
f) If you have Soundblaster try playing with/without the sound. If your
   soundcard is stereo try playing with headphones on. Reverse the headphones
   so that left becomes right. Does it confuse you more. (It has no difference
   on me if you want to know ;) This one is not meant as a torture (Hehe) only
   to see if you're generally well adaptive.

After I switched machines from 386SX-25Mhz to 486DX-33Mhz I had problem
adjusting too. Everything seemed "too smooth". Now when I see it on the 386 it
makes me want to vomit. Sometimes you'll have to give it time to adjust.

4.8 IT NEVER GIVES YOU 100% STATS AT THE END OF LEVEL/GAME.

Hmm, must have missed some treasure/secret room/enemies.

Solution:
1) Improving secret room ratio --> See 4.10
2) Improving treasure ratio = Improving secret ratio since most remaining
   treasure you missed is probably hidden.
3) Improving kill ratio.
   A few dogs running wild may be the cause.
   There's also a few places in the maze where the guards can follow you in
   circles. Back up your tracks, you might smash into one around the corner.

4.9 YOU ALWAYS RUN OUT OF AMMO/HEALTH.

There's plenty of ammo/food/first aid around to last to twice the fun. Problem
is knowing where to find it. Be careful to not leave behind ammo clips dropped
by guards after you kill them. Its only 4 rounds but it adds up. Sometimes
ammo/food/first aid is concentrated in a couple of rooms on a level. If you
find that cache you'll have no problems. Some levels have relatively little
food/first aid but lots of ammo. It may be wise to plan ahead and stay healthy
for that level. You can also plainly waste ammo and overshoot ensuring you'll
be hit as little as possible. Other levels may have little ammo and lots of
food/first aid. Adopt ammo saving strategy there.
Remember that extra-life sphere boosts both your health and ammo.
Also --> See 4.10

4.10 YOU CAN NEVER FIND ANY SECRET ROOMS.

Secret rooms usually house most of the treasure, ammo and health bonuses as
well as machine guns and extra lives.

Some "obvious" places where a secret room may be located are shown below:

Note: %  = wall, o = static object like: barrel, drum, plant etc.
      #  = different wall panel like: Hitler's painting,  Nazi banner etc.
      ]  = Sliding door.
      Possible secret doors are pointed to by < ^ and > or shown as ?

a) Different wall panels

%%%%%%%%#%%%%%%%#%%%%%%%%
%       ^       ^       %
%                       %

%                       %
%                       %

b) Room corners.

c) Between objects and at midpoints of a wall.

%%%%%%%?%%%%%

NOTE: Some secret rooms have secret rooms within them. Sometimes secret
      movable panels can be moved to block each other. Be careful not to
      block yourself in. This is also why sometimes you cannot get 100%
      secret ratio for some levels.


5.0 WOLFENSTEIN ADD-ON SECTION.
    (DISCUSSION OF EXTRA LEVELS/GRAPHICS/OTHERS YOU CAN GET)

All of the programs listed in this section can be found on the two ftp sites:
ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca & ftp.uwp.edu .
Note: Version number in square brackets indicates which version of Wolfenstein
you will need with the specific programs listed.
Also note that archive file extensions were omitted (.zip .arj etc.).
For example: [1.1 S] means version 'The shareware version 1.1'.
I have also included my own rating (number of *'s). This is merely a reflection
of the maps/graphics originality/artwork & bloodbath factor.
* = tame, ***** = suicidal!
Remember versions 1.1 to 1.4 are equivalent!

Lastly, if anyone knows of anymore maps etc. let me know eh?

5.1 EXTRA LEVELS.

                                  but wolfspk4.exe supercedes them.


6.0 WOLFENSTEIN BUGS & PROBLEMS (KNOWN TO DATE),
    AND HOW TO FIX OR GET AROUND THEM.

6.1 HARDWARE PROBLEMS.

Sorry folks. This section is currently pretty vacant. Not to worry though.
I'm sure some of you nice folks out there will send me some info.

- Sound FX all screwed or cut out (SB + compat only).
        If your sounds are short or hang the machine shortly into the game
        then most likely you have an IRQ mismatch on your soundcard. Try
        changing it. Good values are 5 & 7.
        Also try DMA channel change (although #1 (default) should be ok.
        ... and don't forget to set your BLASTER variable in DOS like this.

        SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T4
                     ^^^  ^  ^  ^
        Note: the values pointed at may be different for you.
        Consult your SB & Computer manual.

6.2 SOFTWARE PROBLEMS.

Sorry folks. This section is currently pretty vacant. Not to worry though.
I'm sure some of you nice folks out there will send me some info.

- Game hangs. Sound hangs on last note.
        Try getting rid of some TSRs.
        Also some EMM managers can cause the problem with older versions of
        Wolfenstein.
        v1.1 is notorious for hanging under EMM386.EXE
        All versions are notorious for hanging under DOS6 with EMM386 with
        EMS enabled. If you have /noems switch they behave.

- Game hangs or refuses to run with memory problems.
        If you have DRDOS 6.0 + QEMM with stealth then disable stealth mode.
        Wolfenstein doesn't quite agree with it.

- Game hangs at the 'Get Psyched' screen.
        Err, you probably mixed some version numbers and have a very messy
        directory with 999 add-on maps installed. Wolfenstein won't like that.

- Game hangs with some horizontal stripes through the status bar.
        - Heisenbug, a glitch. Mostly with the add-on maps.
          Reboot, probably won't happen again.
         - Also happens if you mixed versions of VSWAP.??? file and
          version of the game itself.

6.3 GAME SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.

- Disappearing bodies phenomenon. This occurs when there are so many enemies in
  your view at a time that the game stops displaying some. The game engine as
  it seems is limited to only so many "sprites". Anything beyond that and you
  won't be sure which guys will start disappearing. This only occurs on a
  couple of levels in Wolfenstein I think. Be aware if you are editing your own
  map! There is no fix. The engine is set and Id won't rework it.

- Pushwall moves too far phenomenon. This is when the pushewall or secret
  door (if you prefer) moves TOO FAR and blocks your further passage into
  the room full of goodies etc. I cannot recall if there is one in episode
  one, but appearently there are at least two places where this occurs in
  episode 6.

  Episode 6, level 2.  This is the FIRST pushwall in the map.  All
  others on this level are *behind* it.

  This is shown below:

before pushing:
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWW   W   WWW
                P*  WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW

after pushing:
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWW   W   WWW
             P   *  WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW

  You are where the '*' is you, and you push the pushwall 'P'
  'W' is other parts of walls.
  It's supposed to move two grid locations and stop, so
  you can go around it.  Instead, it moves three, and blocks
  everything.

  Note: This does not always happen. That is soemtimes the pushwall
        will move 2 grid locations i.e correctly.
        Also any interference from guards behind it is not connected
        with this since that would prevent oushwall moving at all
        or impede it to move only 1 grid location.
 
  Solution: Well it looks like there isn't one at the moment.
  There was a suggestion of inserting "stacks 9, 256" in the config.sys
  file, but this doesn't seem to help.
