[1.1]  A word from me

Who am I?  I'm an avid game player, probably a lot like you.  I spend as much
time playing games as I do sleeping or studying; sometimes more than both
put together.  I'm not a 3D-games-only kind of gamer, but 3D games are a
particular favorite of mine.  I don't guarantee that all of the facts in this
FAQ are true, but I try to make this as informative and truthful a document as
I humanly can.  If you have some tidbits of information, or, heck, a whole
flood of information tidbits, let me know and I'll put it in the FAQ along
with your name in the credits.  The best way to reach me is through the
internet.  Try these addresses in this order:  ss1@christa.unh.edu,
stoddard@ctron.com.

[1.2]  About this FAQ

This FAQ is copyrighted (see above) by Samuel Stoddard.  While it is
authorized and "officialized" by 3D Realms, it is not the property nor the
work of 3D Realms.  However, 3D Realms has contributed generously to its
creation and growth; for that, I offer my sincere thanks.

If you are browsing this FAQ for the first time, but think it looks familiar,
that's probably because you've also browsed the Apogee FAQ.  I'm the
maintainer of both and modeled the 3D Realms FAQ after the Apogee FAQ.

[1.4]  What is 3D Realms?

3D Realms is a games distributor for PC games, specializing in 3D games.
These include flight simulators, 3D shooters, and the widely acclaimed
3D action games that came into popularity with Apogee's and id's
Wolfenstein 3D and id's Doom.  3D Realms aims are to make its games as cutting
edge as possible, pushing the limits of technology with each release.
3D Realms acts as a distributor for games written by other companies, but it
also has its own staff of programmers, artists, and musicians, who write most
of 3D Realms' games.  3D Realms markets their games by releasing a portion of
each as shareware and making the complete games available upon registration.

The 3D Realms motto is:  "Reality is our game."  The following excerpt is a
statement from 3D Realms' catalog:

Focusing on cutting edge 3D action games.  That single sentence sums up our
vision.  3D Realms is 100 percent dedicated to developing and publishing
immersive 3D games.  It's our specialty.  We're wildly driven by our vision.
We're not going to be distracted by making platform games, puzzle games,
fighting games or adventure games -- we'll only make 3D games.

[1.5]  How 3D Realms markets its games

In 1987, Apogee came up with a unique method of marketing their games.  Since
then, other shareware companies have adopted their strategy.  Their scheme is
this:  each game they produce is divided into three to four, sometimes even
six episodes.  The first episode is free.  It can be downloaded from
CompuServe, BBS's, or the Internet, or bought in a store that distributes
shareware games for disk copying charges.  You can distribute the shareware
episode to your friends yourself, if you like, provided you leave all the
original files intact.  When 3D Realms was born as a sister company to Apogee,
Apogee's shareware scheme was adopted.

If you like the shareware episode of a game, 3D Realms requires that you
register it.  This is the normal rule regarding shareware.  Upon registration,
you will receive the complete game.  3D Realms uses this marketing scheme so
that people can have a good idea about the game they are buying before they
put their cash on the line.

[1.6]  Getting the latest information

There are a few ways to get the latest information about 3D Realms, even if
you want it more quickly than keeping up with the latest revisions of this FAQ
would do.  These methods are mentioned briefly in the following sections:

[1.6.1]  Electronic news

On Usenet, the newsgroups alt.games.apogee, comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc.action,
and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc all carry discussion about 3D Realms' latest.
3D Realms monitors these, plus the gaming, shareware, and the Apogee support
conferences on Fidonet, Rime, Intelec, ILink, and U'NI-Net.

[1.6.2]  3D Realms' internet mailing list

3D Realms has an Internet mailing list.  Whenever new games or slide shows are
released (or other important information), 3D Realms sends the information out
in a mailing.  If you would like to be on this mailing list, contact Joe
Siegler (apogee.software@apogee1.com or apogee@metronet.com, in that order).
Those email addresses send directly to Joe Siegler, and not to a list daemon
or robot.  The mailing list is free of charge.

This mailing list is the same one as the Apogee mailing list; if you're
on one, you're on the other.

[1.6.3]  Finger files

}On the internet, you can finger apogee@3drealms.com, and receive all
the latest information about 3D Realms.  Usually this entails both recent and
upcoming releases, among other things.

[1.6.4]  World Wide Web

}You can reach the 3D Realms and Apogee home pages by connecting to one of
}the following:

[2.1]  Other companies

[2.1.1]  What is 3D Realms' relationship with Apogee?

3D Realms and Apogee are sister companies, both divisions of Action
Entertainment, Inc.  Originally, Action Entertainment's next-generation
of 3D games were going to be published under the Apogee name.  However,
in late August of 1994, 3D Realms was born, and the four next-generation
3D games that Action had under production (namely, "Shadow Warrior," "Blood,"
}"Duke Nukem 3D," and "Ruins: Return of the Gods" [this latter was later
}cancelled], all of which use the "build" engine) moved under the 3D Realms
label.

[2.2]  History of specific games

[2.2.1]  Terminal Velocity

Written by Mark Randel, the lead programmer of Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0,
Terminal Velocity was the first game ever to be released under the 3D Realms
label.  The slide show was released on April 4, 1995, and the game itself
followed on May 1.  And thus, 3D Realms emerged into the "realm" of the
computer gaming world.

There's a second distinguishing fact about Terminal Velocity; namely, that
it made the cover of the April 1995 issue of the gaming magazine, "Computer
Player."  This is the first time in the history of computer gaming that a
shareware game made the cover of a popular gaming magazine before its
release.  In the article, many praising comments are made:  "The 3D
environments are simply breathtaking. Utilizing cutting-edge real-time
techniques, the graphics engine creates worlds that are like nothing seen
before in computer games."  And, "A great deal of attention was spent to
balance the fast action with the spectacular environment.  Terminal Velocity
has achieved what many have unsuccessfully tried in the past:  an incredible
combination of scenery and game play."

There are two noteworthy remarks contained in 3D Realms' initial press
release for the game.  One is, "Climb into Terminal Velocity now, and you'll
never go back to flight simulators that offer combat as an 'option.'"
Wrapping up 3D Realms' plot synopsis is the comment, "You're outgunned,
outmanned, and strapped into a flying coffin.  But just think how good
'Saved the Known Galaxy' will look on your resume."

[2.2.2]  Blood

What follows is a slightly modified account of the history of Blood as told
by Peter Freese, vice president of Q Studios.

Blood is a 3D action horror game that pits your wits and skill against the
undead denizens of several ghastly worlds.  It is being developed by
Q Studios and will be published by 3D Realms.  Q Studios is a game
development company located out of Redmond, Washington, and was formed by
peter Freese and Nick Newhard during the summer of 1994 in order to create
Blood as well as other games.  Presently, Nick Newhard is the president of
Q Studios, and Peter Freese is the vice president.  Both take an active part
in Blood's development.

Blood was originally conceived by Nick Newhard in late 1993, with the idea of
being something like a 3D Gauntlet-style game.  Nick was researching 3D engines
at the time and decided to leave a programming position at Edmark Corporation
(developing educational games) to begin work on the project with Chris Rush,
artist and longtime friend.  Nick's idea was to develop a networked game that
would be PC based and run in arcades.  A deal was made with Apogee to work on
the game and set up "Apogee West," a West coast division of Apogee that would
recruit and work with local talent.  In the spring of 1994, the situation
changed somewhat as Apogee/3D Realms decided they wanted Nick to work
exclusively on the project rather than setting up Apogee West.  By this time,
the game had moved to being a shareware release and the concept had taken on
a horror theme.  Peter Freese began working part-time, doing some of the
programming.  In late spring, Chris Rush left the project.  Throughout the
summer, Nick and Peter began discussing the formation of a company.  In July,
Kevin Kilstrom and Erik Klokstad, both artists, were hired.  In October, Erik
left, and Peter started working full-time.  Q Studios became incorporated in
November 1994.  Artist Terry Hamel was hired in June 1995 and level designer
Jay Wilson (aka "Shade") in August.  The music and sound effects will be
produced by LoudMouth.

Blood uses what's called the "build" engine, which is the 3D rendering
technology behind it.  This was written by Ken Silverman, who also wrote
"Ken's Labyrinth," a 3D game with a Wolfenstein-like engine published by Epic
Megagames some years ago.  He has been working for 3D Realms creating the
build engine since late 1993.

[3.1]  Games

Please note that this information is constantly changing, especially when new
games are added to the list of 3D Realms products.  Some of the information
given here could become out of date rather quickly.

[3.1.1]  What games are currently available from 3D Realms?

A list of 3D Realms games follows.  The filename given is the file -- on
CompuServe, BBS's, and the Internet -- which contains the first episode of
each game.  On CompuServe, there are no numbers or punctuation in the
filenames at all.

The price given is the cost of the *complete* game with all episodes. The "Ep"
field contains the number of episodes in the complete version. The "Ver"
field contains the latest version number of the game.  "Gph" is the best
graphics mode that the game utilizes.

 * - There is a disk based version of Terminal Velocity, available for $29.95,
            which contains everything on the CD except for the cinematics,
            high-res textures, the bonus planet, and the extra shareware games.
            The CD version of Terminal Velocity is $39.95.  Version 1.0 of the
            shareware version does not contain SVGA support.

 ~ - These games contain some measure of graphic violence, and may be
            unsuitable for young game players.  Each has an official notice
            about violent content.

 = - There's a Dwango client for Terminal Velocity, available as TVDWANGO.ZIP,
     which allows you to play Terminal Velocity on a Dwango network.  The
     Dwango client software is included in all versions of TV 1.2 and the
     registered version of 1.1.  This separate client is only necessary if you
     have a version of TV different from one of these.

[3.1.2]  The games are too big to download!  Are there "split" versions?

There are split versions of the larger games available at Software Creations
and on the Internet.  Other forums do not carry the split versions.

[3.1.4]  Hardware requirements and support

[Terminal Velocity]

 Required:       486DX-40, VGA, 8 megs RAM (4 megs for v1.0)
 Recommended:    486DX2-66 (486DX4-100 for SVGA), VGA, 8 megs RAM (12 megs for
                 hi-res textures; 16 megs for hi-res textures and SVGA), Local

 Notes:          On my 486DX-33, this game runs with a small but tolerable
                 frame rate with no noticeable slowdowns except when entering
                 or exiting tunnels.

[3.1.5]  Which of 3D Realms' games are good?

What follows is a series of evaluations for each game.  Ratings are given on
a scale of 1-10, 5 being the minimum "good" rating.  (A rating of 10 does not
mean perfection, for in the gaming world, perfection is never achieved;
someone will always come out with something better later.)

Ratings are given for different categories.  For all but the last category,
the ratings are my own personal ratings.  The final category contains the
results of the rating system, whereby game players far and wide may contact
me via Internet email with their own evaluations of each game.  To send
your own evaluations, please see the instructions and rules in the next
section.

For the "Grph" field, the letter indicates (T)ext, (C)GA, (E)GA, (V)GA,
or (S)VGA.  "Snd" is sound.  "Msc" is music.  The "Enem" field rates how
unique and interesting the enemies are.  The "Lvl" field rates the design of
the levels.  The "Game" field rates the gameplay, or how well the game "works"
as a game.  The "Overall" field is not an average, but rather how lastingly
enjoyable the game is to play.  The "Vote Results" field gives two values:
the first is the average rating from the voting system; the second is the
number of people who have given ratings for that particular game.

 Name                       Grph Snd Msc Enem Lvl Game Overall  Vote Results

To send in your votes, send mail to one of:  ss1@christa.unh.edu or
stoddard@ctron.com.  Include something on the order of "3D Realms Votes" in
the subject line.  The body of the message should contain one or more Apogee
games that you're voting on, one vote per game.  Your vote will be a rating
from 1 through 10, inclusive.  Use whole numbers -- the decimals in the
results are given for accuracy.  Include one vote per line, something like
this:
               10     Terminal Nukem
               8      Shadow Velocity
               6      Blood Warrior 3D

The games you can vote on are those listed in the above section ONLY.  Don't
vote on non-3D Realms games, discontinued 3D Realms games, or beta versions
of yet to be released 3D Realms games.

So what will your votes do?  Your votes will be averaged in with all the other
votes.  The average and the total number of voters will be listed in the
ratings section.  Your votes will be taken into consideration for the next
release of the 3D Realms FAQ, and, from then, forever after.  There is no need
to resend votes unless you want to change a vote.

[3.2]  Past projects

[3.2.1]  Working titles of 3D Realms games

Sometimes, over the course of a game's development, the game's title can
change, once, twice, or more.  Here is a list of some of 3D Realms' games with
their former titles.

Terminal Velocity                                              Velocity Brawl

}[3.2.2]  Cancelled projects
}
}Frequently, projects that get started never get finished.  This can happen for
}a number of reasons.  Legal problems is one common cause; slow progress and
}little promise is another.  What follows is a list of projects that, for one
}reason or another, never saw the light of day.  Dates are approximations of
}the time each game spent under development.

Type "GO REALMS" at a ! prompt.  The CompuServe forum is a combined forum,
containing Apogee games as well as 3D Realms games.

[5.1.4]  America Online

Use the keyword "3d Realms" to go to 3D Realms' forum.  This same area also
holds Apogee games.

[5.1.5]  Fidonet

If you are a Fidonet SysOp, you can get 3D Realms' games on the Fido Filebone.
Talk to your local filebone hub about the Apogee FDN areas.  See
FILEBONE.NA for more information.  Send netmail to 1:124/9006 for more
information on these areas.

[5.2]  The Registered Episodes

The registered versions of the software are the complete versions, and, as
they are not shareware, cannot legally exist on public BBS's or FTP sites.
The registered versions of the software must be purchased directly from
3D Realms or from one of 3D Realms' dealers.

[5.2.1]  Ordering information

To order directly from 3D Realms, call 1-800-3DREALMS.  The line is open 24
hours a day.

}TEN at this time, the following upcoming games will:  Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow
}Warrior, and Blood.  Most likely, Terminal Velocity will support TEN also.
}
}TEN is a service not yet publically available.  You can visit TEN's web pages
}by connecting to http://www.ten.net/ for more information.

[6.2]  Cheating

3D Realms has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games,
both documented and undocumented.  Sometimes these cheats are available in all
versions of the game; other times they are only available in the registered.
Documented cheats are listed in the game manuals of the registered versions,
and sometimes in the XXXXHELP.EXE files that come with both the shareware
and registered versions of the games.

The cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.
The customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or
game manual that comes with the game.  Some of the games also have a debugging
mode, which is not generally documented.  Their original purpose is to aid in
the beta testing of the game.  Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is
left intact, available for the regular game-player to use.  Finally, there are
technical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to
correct some technical problems.

[6.2.1]  Complete cheat list

This section contains a variety of cheats from various 3D Realms games.  It's
as complete as is humanly possible to make it.

Note that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by 3D Realms,
the debug keys are not.  If you use the debug keys, 3D Realms cannot provide
any support, since this alters game performance to a state where their
standard support comments and issues might not apply.  In short, neither
3D Realms or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug
keys.  (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing
happening, save where expressly noted below.)


[Terminal Velocity]

+ Customer Cheat - The following cheats are available by typing in the given
                   codes, one character at a time:

       [P] - Play a demo.


[6.3]  Secrets and other fun things

Frequently, game programmers will embed little fun things into their games.
Usually, these things would not crop up under ordinary game play.  Sometimes
it requires doing certain things, typing certain codes, or even activating
the program on a particular day or time.  Sometimes these little things are
called "easter eggs."  Below are some such things that can be found in some
of Apogee's games, and the instructions for getting to them.

[Terminal Velocity]

}When you start a new game in the registered CD version, you can get to the
}hidden planet by entering "Terminal" as your name and "Reality" as your
}call sign.  (Both of these are case sensitive.)  The hidden planet is not in
}the shareware version or the disk based registered version.

Also, in level 3-1 of Terminal Velocity, fly close to the ground near the
coordinates (63,227).  You will see a photographic image of the Terminal
Reality team.  If you fly too high, the fog will obstruct the view.  A
clearer version of this can be found as a GIF file on the Terminal
}Velocity CD in the PREVIEW directory.

[6.4]  Troubleshooting

[6.4.1]  Things to try first

If you have a program with a 3D Realms game not starting correctly, there are a
few things you can try.  First, make sure your system meets the hardware
requirements of the game.  If they don't, you probably can't run the game
without upgrading your hardware.

Second, make sure you have the most recent version of the game.  Many older
versions of games have bugs that are fixed in the most recent versions.

Third, if there is a XXXXHELP.EXE file that came with the game, read it.
(Most registered 3D Realms games have such a file on the first game disk;
with shareware versions, you might find it there and possibly in the directory
the game was installed to as well.)  This file will contain numerous common
technical problems with their solutions.  There are plans underway to make
a file available on-line which will contain all the current versions of
the technical support files in them.

If the game is failing to start due to insufficient memory, you can try
removing TSRs, or booting "clean."  With MS-DOS 6.0 or greater, you can do
this by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the system is booting.
This causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be bypassed.  If you
are running a memory manager, try removing the manager altogether; this
seems to fix most problems 3D Realms games have with EMS/XMS memory.
Additional suggestions on how to free up memory may be in the XXXXHELP.EXE
file.

Also, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some
games, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the
game.  Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.

If you've tried everything and still can't get a 3D Realms game to work
correctly, contact 3D Realms' technical support services.  These are listed
under "Contacting 3D Realms."
