MISSION BEGINS 

Once again, British military agent Blake Stone will find himself in a life or death struggle for the control 
of humanity's future. After a five year manhunt for the elusive Dr. Goldfire, the search has ended. 

The trail has led Blake to the planet Selon, and to the abandoned STAR Institute Training Complex. 
If the reports are correct, then Dr. Goldfire is alive and has once again created a fiendish army of evil 
mutants. Blake is going to need all his wits, skill, and the best firepower money can buy to put an 
end to Goldfire's plans. Blake's mission is clear, he must use all his resources to destroy Dr. Goldfire before 
he can unleash his new army of mutant creatures on the universe. 

SKILL LEVELS 
Choose from four skill levels. Each level differs in the amount of enemies you will battle and the amount of 
damage the enemies can endure. 

Level 1; Novice Agent— for non-gamers or younger players. 
Level 2: Skilled Agent — for part-time gamers. 
Level 3: Expert Agent— for experienced gamers. 
Level 4: Veteran Agent— for the fearless only! 

CALL TO ARMS 
The numeric keys 1-6 can he used to select a particular weapon. 

1 = Auto Charge Pistol 
2 = Slow Fire Protector 
3 = Rapid Assault Weapon 
4 = Dual Neutron Disrupter 
5 = Plasma Discharge Unit 
6 = Anti-Plasma Cannon 

You begin the mission with weapon #1. Until you acquire other weapons, pressing 2-6 will have no effect. If 
the current weapon you are using becomes depleted, you will revert to the base level weapon — the Auto Charge Pistol. 

OPENING DOORS AND ACTIVATING SWITCHES 
To open doors and activate transporters, move in front of the door or the transporter and press the SPACE BAR. 

Some walls in the complex can be pushed back to reveal hidden areas. To search for the push walls, move 
close to a wall and press the SPACE BAR. When found, the wall will make a noise then slide backward. These walls
are rare, so be patient while searching. 

There are hazards which can be activated and deactivated by switches located on the same levels as the hazard. 
These switches toggle off or on by use of the SPACE BAR. 

Several of the doors in each of the facilities will require color coded access cards. The cards can be found 
somewhere on the same level as the locked door. Using an access card requires no additional commands other than 
the SPACE BAR to open the locked door. 

GATHERING THE GOODS 
To pick up an item, simply walk over it. If you don't need it at this time, it will remain on the floor until you 
really do need it. 

For example, if you are carrying the maximum energy stored of 100% for most weapons, you won’t pick up a charge pack 
by walking over it. 

MOVING TO THE NEXT AREA 
In each area there is an transporter that can take you to another area. There may also be a teleporter that can 
move you elsewhere in the area. Each area in the complex is locked and requires destroying the Security Cube 
before travelling to another area. Once you are standing in front of a teleporter, face the control pad and press 
the SPACE BAR. Select the area from the map that you wish to explore. All areas can be reentered. You can go back 
to previously explored areas and pick up things you left behind. 

ITEMS YOU CAN PICK UP: 

Planet Strike has five types of items. You'll want and need to pick them up. WEAPONS & AMMUNITION, HEALTH 
ITEMS, ACCESS CARDS, FISSION DETONATOR, and BONUS ITEMS. 

WEAPONS: 

AUTO CHARGE PISTOL (ACT) 
The ACP does not require a charge pack; you'll have to wait for the unit to recharge itself. Its a silent 
attack weapon. 

SLOW FIRE PROTECTOR (SFP) 
This weapon requires a charge pack for use. There is a slight delay between shots fired. It does allow for more 
rapid firing than the ACP. 

RAPID ASSAULT WEAPON (RAW) 
A medium speed repeat-f ire unit, the RAW requires a charge pack. Like the SFP it cannot recharge itself. 

DUAL NEUTRON DISRUPTGR (DXD) 
This high speed, repeat-fire unit is fitted with dual oscillating barrels. It packs a wallop, but requires 
the stored energy of a charge pack. 

PLASMA DISCHARGE UNIT (PDU) 
The PDU has a wide range of detonation and repeat fire capabilities; this is a powerful weapon. It also 
requires an energy charge pack for operation. 

ANTI-PLASMA CANNON (APC) 
If you want to dispatch some enemies P.D.Q.— use the APC. This is the weapon of choice when Blake wants 
to dish out some pain. It also requires an energy charge pack for operation. The APC can also destroy unlocked doors. 

AMMUNITION: 

FULL AND PARTIAL CHARGE PACKS 
The Full charge packs can be found throughout the complex. They increase your current charge by 8%. Partial charge 
packs can be picked up next to the bodies of dead enemies. They will increase your current charge level by 
whatever percentage charge remains in the pack. 

ACCESS CARDS 
Access cards allow you to enter locked doors throughout the floor. The red, blue, and gold cards are use to unlock 
the doors that match the corresponding color. 

RADAR POWER PACKS 
Radar power packs charge the Auto-mapper for operation in the magnify modes. The higher the magnify mode, the faster 
the unit uses power. So use the power packs sparingly. 

FISSION DETONATOR 
The Fission Detonator is a bomb that must be picked up and placed beside the Security Cube. The Security Cube 
must be destroyed before proceeding to the next level.

HEALTH ITEMS: 

FIRST AID KIT 
This item increases your health by the largest percentage. Pick it up and you'll raise your health by 30%. 

STEAK 
It's there, and it's not refrigerated, but steak raises your health by 20%. 

RAW MEAT 
Who cares who dropped it! It's food, and food equals health. A 15% increase is gained from this item. 

SANDWICH 
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce? Eat it—it gains you 10%. 

CANDY BAR 
This little tidbit will increase your health by 8%. 

WATER BOWL 
This may not be bottled water, but it increases your health by 5%. 

BONUS ITEMS: 

MONEY BAGS 
Okay, so you say money can't buy you happiness, but these bags increase your score by 100 points. 

LOOT 
This item increases your score by 500. And it's just lying there? 

GOLD BARS 
Somebody's got a hole in their pocket! In varying amounts these items are strewn throughout the complex. 
Take advantage of their misfortune—it's tax free and it increases your score in amounts ranging from 250 to 1000. 

XYLAN ORB 
They're worth 5000 in extra points! Remember with every 400,000 points you are awarded an extra life. 

ONE CREDIT TOKEN 
You can use these at the Food Units. Pick'em up; you never know when you’ll need 'em! The name says 
it, these are worth one credit. The most token credits you can carry is 25. 

FIVE CREDIT TOKEN 
Now we're talking serious prepackaged food items. Use these 1 to buy food, thus health, at the Food Units. 
They are valued at 5 credits. The most token credits you can carry is 25. 

FOOD UNITS 
The Food Units dispense items which can add to your health. To use them, walk up to the Unit and press the 
SPACE BAR. The Food Units require a token in order to operate. The REBA interface will describe each item as 
it is dispensed. 

FRIEND... OR FOE? 

You can be sure that most of the others whose path you 11 cross arc out to blast you, A few, however, arc here 
to help you. Of course, all the opponents will vary in weapons, strength, speed, skill and intelligence. Stay 
on your toes; you 11 need to size up the situations as they arise. 

Many of these guys are loyal to Dr. Goldfire, which means they'll waste you if they get the chance. But some 
can actually help you survive. Valuable information, charge packs, or tokens can be gained from these Bio-Tech 
informants. Walk up close to them and use the SPACE BAR to gain the goods! 

SECTOR GUARDS 
The Sector Guards aren't out to help anybody — especially you. This deadly guard packs the lethal Slow-Fire 
Protector.

TECH WARRIORS 
"Professional" best describes these security guards. They are armed with auto-repeating rifles and they know 
how to use them. Oh yeah— they won't go down without a fight! Kill one and take his rifle. That's what we're here 
for, isn't it? 

ALIEN PROTECTORS 
The toughest of the tough. These guys are determined! With security vests to protect them, you might knock 'em down, 
but... they won't stay down! 

AND MORE... AND MORE... AND... 
Surely, the future wouldn't be complete without a grouping of ghastly creatures to thwart your mission. Planet 
Strike is packed with slobbering aliens, battle thirsty mutants, tech traps, guards and more. Be warned; 
they lurk at every turn! 

STATUS PANEL 

The status line located at the top of the screen displays the current FLOOR number, the COMPLEX AREA name 
and the number of LIVES remaining. 

FLOOR 
There are 20 plus floors in Planet Strike . The current floor is shown at the top left corner of the status line. 

LIVES 
You start the mission with three lives. If you die, you will restart the level from the point at which you began. 
You'll lose the weapons and points you obtained (on that level) before your death, but your health will be restored 
to the maximum. 

COMPLEX AREA 
Where are you? This displays the area's name. 

STATUS PANEL (CONTINUED) 

REBA INTERFACE 
When enabled, the REBA INTERFACE displays information about the enemy, food unit selections, the current food 
unit tokens inventory, or current items which are being picked up. Also, REBA relays information on the Access 
Cards needed to unlock specific doors, displays Bio-Tech conversations, and other general information. 

HEALTH MONITOR 
The Health Monitor reveals your current physical condition during game play. Your mental health is your 
business! When you begin Planet Strike, your Health is 100%. Each time your enemy inflicts damage, your health 
is reduced. To restore your health, visit a food dispenser or find a first aid kit. 

CHARGE STATE MONITOR 
The current Charge State displays how much of a charge remains in your charge pack. If you are using the Auto 
Charge Pistol, then it displays a WAIT message until the ACP's internal pack has been fully charged. 

SCORE DISPLAY 
This Is displayed in the top right of the lower status area. You can gain points by picking up treasure or by 
killing an opponent. Every 400,000 points provides an extra life. 

ACCESS CARD DISPLAY 
When you find an access card, a graphic representation of that card will be shown below the health display area. 

AUTO-MAPPING DISPLAY 
The Auto-Mapping is an overhead rotating view of the areas that the player has seen. The Auto-Map has two levels 
of magnification. In the 2x mag mode, the map resolution is doubled. In the 4x mag mode, the map resolution is 
four times the normal mode. 

Auto-Map colors are: Flashing white dot = you; Green dots = doors; Red dots - locked doors and enemies; 
Light blue dots = secret doors; Yellow dots = security cube. 

SELECTED WEAPON DISPLAY 
This monitor displays the weapon currently being used. The lower right corner also displays the current 
percentage of charge remaining. Weapon selection is made from the keyboard by pressing keys 1-6. 

AUTO-MAP MAGNIFY MODES 
The Auto-Map is an overhead rotating view of the areas that the player has seen. In the normal mode 
(no magnification) it shows the player as a white dot and the areas seen in green. By using the "+" key or 
the key to increase and decrease magnification mode, the player is able to increase the detail of 
the auto-map. 

In the 2x magnification mode, the map's resolution is doubled, and now other characters that are in range show 
up as multi-colored dots. 

In the 4x magnification mode, the map resolution is doubled again and you are now able to see pushable walls that are 
near. The push walls show up as light blue dots. 

MISSION 

Planet Strike takes place in the abandoned STAR Institute Training Complex. Blake Stone starts the mission in the 
Transport Arrival Area of the STAR Institute. Reports confirm that fiercely guarded security devices are in each area, and 
they must be disabled before Blake can proceed, Blake must find the Fission Detonator that is used to destroy 
the teleport Security Cube in that area before beaming to the next area. 

The Security Cube devices have been placed on every teleport that is used to exit an area. Blake must destroy 
this security device to unlock the teleport before he can advance to the next area of the facility 

The Detonators, which appear as red canisters, must be found in each area. Once the detonator has been 
located, Blake must locate the Security Cube, and use SPACEBAR to drop the detonator. If Blake is not close 
enough to the cube, or if he is in another part of the map, the REBA display will give a warning. 

Once Blake has gone through each area and destroyed the Security Cubes, he will beam to floor number 20. 
There he will have his final battle against the evil Dr. Goldfire. 

CHEAT CODE 

The following cheat mode will help you out. Using this cheat code will give you full ammo, health, all the 
weapons, and all the access cards. 

To activate the cheat mode, type (one letter at a time from within the game) "JAM" and then press the ENTER 
key. You may use this cheat as many times as you wish, but your score will be set to zero with each use. 

MISSION STRATEGIES AND TIPS 

Here are just a few tips to keep you blasting in Planet Strike. They may help save your life. At the 
very least, they'll save your nervous system! 

• Shoot PerScan Drones and Volatile Transports (VT's) from a distance. Their explosions can damage you! 
• Use PerScan Drones and VT's to damage opponents near them. 
• Weapons can detonate ammo on the ground. Be careful! 
• Use the radar to detect cloaked enemies. 
• Do not destroy PerScan Drones or VT's around hibernating aliens. The explosions will release them. 
• Shoot at the crates with the Slow Fire Protector — this will conserve ammunition. 
• When entering rooms through opening doors, quickly enter the room and then back out. This will alert 
any potential ambusher and give you a chance to blast him first. 
• Interrogate all Bio-Technicians at least three times. The first time he'll give you a clue; the second, 
ammunition; the third, a food token. 
• Use the Plasma Discharge Unit to kill opponents around corners. 
• When shooting an opponent with one of the larger weapons, back away while shooting. This will keep you
at a safer distance and allow more hits to wear him down. 
• When fighting opponents that shoot at you, keep moving side to side. 
• Kill the shooting aliens — locked behind barriers— before deactivating the barriers. 
• Try to destroy the ceiling turrets as quickly as possible when you see them, before they lock-on to you 
and begin firing. Use the RAW or DND. 
• The Fluid Aliens can only take damage when they are standing. 
• Don't loiter in rooms with electric sockets on the walls. The Plasma Aliens will emerge and attack until 
you are dead! 
• Don't shoot any helpful informants and you will be well rewarded! 
• Use the keyboard and the mouse to play the game. The mouse provides better control for shooting and 
turning. Also, the Strafe mode is much easier using the second mouse button. 
• Remember, you can always return to previously played floors to retrieve items you did not pick up. This 
might be a saving grace when low on health or ammunition. 
• Some pushwalls may require more than one push. 
• Find all of the loot. High scores receive extra bonuses!
