As Adolf Hitler Rises to Power... 

With the power of cold steel and hot lead, Hitler is deteimined to 
mold his Fatherland into a glorious Third Reich — a new holy empire. 

As a youth he was ambitious for priesthood, but now Hitler sets his 
sites on loftier goals. Comparing himself to the Messiah and claim- 
ing to speak the will of God, he falls deeper within his own twisted 
occult mentality. A psychotic desire to be the Second Coming leads him 
to quest for all the legendary icons of Christianity. 

The artifact that Hitler covets most is the Spear of Destiny, the weapon that 
was used to pierce the side of Christ while he was nailed to the cross. 
According to legend, no man can be defeated with this spear in his pos- 
session. For centuries, great leaders of Prussia and Germany had rode to 
victory with the Spear at their side. But after WW I it was taken from Ger- 
many and placed under glass in a museum in Versailles. Hiller becomes 
determined to retrieve it and while France is struck bv the German blitz- 
krieg or lightning war, the Spear is quietly taken from Versailles and 
shipped to a stronghold in Germany. 

Sanctified with the blood of Christ and hardened in the hands of warriors, the Spear is Hitler's 
most prized possession. With it, he believes himself to be invincible! Letting Providence 
dictate his course, he sends his armies across Europe with the conviction of a madman and the assurance 
of a sleep- walker. Nothing can withstand the awesome power of the blitzkrieg and millions fall prey 
to Hitler's armies. 

The Story So Far...

You're William J. "B.J. Blazkowicz, the Allies' bad boy of espionage and a ter- 
minal action seeker. Rumors are that Hitler's use of the Spear has grown 
even more bizarre. The diabolical Dr. Schabbs, Hitler's minister of the maca- 
bre is using the Spear as part of his scientific ambitions to raise the dead. 

Like most at Allied Head Quarters, you're skeptical of the validity of the 
Spear's power and dismiss the stories as Nazi propaganda. Your beliefs rest 
solely in the power of lead — hocus pocus is for fairy tales. However, you 
realize that capturing the Spear may push the already unbalanced Adolf off 
the edge! In either case, your orders are clear — infiltrate the Nazi stronghold at 
Nuremberg and secure the Spear. 

Now...

Youre behind enemy lines, among the bushes far below the Nazi strong- 
hold, A set of sewer tunnels lead to the lowest depths of the castle's dun- 
geons. Above that stands the huge castle itself. Within lies the item 
which could control the fate of mankind, Hundreds of Nazi soldiers and 
thousands of Nazi bullets stand in your way! You quietly enter the 
moss-covered tunnel. 

Unknown to you and unnoticed by nearby guards, an unnatural glow 
radiates from high within the lower. Feeling as if you're being watched, 
you quietly slip a fresh dip into your pistol — ready for what lies ahead. 
But nothing on earth could prepare you for the conflict that awaits — as 
you battle for the Spear of Destiny! 

INTRODUCTION

CONTROLLING

corridor that's heavily overgrown with vines. Armed with only a 
knife and pistol you cautiously walk forward. Beyond this tunnel 
waits hundreds of Nazi guards who are ready to fight and die to 
safeguard the Spear. 

The following is a list of controls and commands for moving and 
fighting within Spear of Destiny. 

Travelling 
The key to playing Spear of is learning how to effectively 
maneuver through the castle's passages. Once in the game, you'll 
need to move quickly in order to surprise guards and avoid others. 

Walking — Use the up and down arrow keys to walk backwards and forwards through the dungeon.

Run — Hold down the right Shift kev and the up or down arrow key to run. 

Turning - Use the left and right arrow keys to turn.

Fast Turn — Hold down the right Shift key and the left or right arrow key for fast turns. 

Strafe — Press the Alt key and the left or right Arrow key to move from side to side 
instead of turning left or right.

Arming Yourself 
Once you have more than one gun, you'll want to choose between firearms. The numeric keys 1-4 select 
a particular weapon. You cannot use the numeric keypad keys for this selection.

The weapons are: 

1-Knife 
2=Pistol 
3=Machine Gun 
4=Chaingun 

You start the game with only a knife and a pistol. Until you discover other weapons, pressing "3" or 
"4" will have no effect. If you are out of ammo, you can only use the knife. Pressing a number key 
will have no effect.

Killing the Enemy 
To use your knife or fire your weapon point it toward your adversary and press the Ctrl key. 

If you are using a machine gun or chaingun, you can hold down the Ctrl key for rapid fire. 

The accuracy of a weapon diminishes with the range of the shot. 
Aim to the left or right of an enemy if your bullets are not hit- 
ting. A healthy dose of your victim's splattering blood is a good 
indicator that you've hit. 

Doors & Pushwalls 

Doors 
To open a door, move in front of it and press the spacebar. It is not 
necessary to actually touch a door before opening it. 

Locked Doors 
Several doors in Spear of Destiny are locked and will require keys. 
The key that opens a particular door can be found somewhere on 
the same floor as the locked door. Using a key requires no additional 
commands other than the spacebar to open a doon 

Pushwalls 
The castle is full of secret passages that are concealed behind push-
walls. To reveal a push wall, move against a wall and press the space- 
bar. The push wall will then slide backwards, revealing the passage. 

Picking Up Stuff 
Though the fighting is fierce, there's always time to grab a few trinkets or helpful items. 
To pick up an item simply walk over it. You're smart and will know if you need to take it. 
For example, if you're carrying the maximum ammunition of 99 bullets, you can't pick up more 
ammunition by walking over it. 

Getting to the Next Floor 
Each door contains at least one elevator. Once vou find an elevator, presss the spacebar to open its door. 

Then w alk into the elevator and press the spacebar once again to activate the knife switch 
and move to the next floor.

strongholds. 

Killing 
Ammo - 4, 9

ammo for the taking! Pick up unused ammo for 8 bullets or an ammo box for 25 bullets. 

Machine Gun 
This machine gun is the primary armament of the SS guards. It's an 
efficient weapon that is useful for attacking multiple enemies. 

Chaingun 
The Chaingun is a destructive killing machine that will clear the room. However, it 
has a healthy appetite for ammo. 

Treasure 
Hitler has a twisted desire for treasure and religious artifacts. His ill-gotten booty 
is stored within the secret rooms of the castle. 

Cross 
100 Points

Chalice 
500 Points

1000 Points

One Ups = Full Health, 25 Ammo and One Life. 
Within secret rooms of the castle are items that give you the extra urge to keep fighting! 

DENIZENS OF SPEAR OF DESTINY 

Spear of Destiny is filled with a hostof people who would like nothing 
better than to see you in a body bag. Remember that anything moving is a threat. 

The opponents you will be up against vary in weapons, body armor, speed, skill, aggressive- 
ness, and even intelligence. 

Regular Guards 

Guards 
The bullies in brown go down easy, but there's a lot of 'em. 

SS 
Members of the Schutzstaffel, they wear blue uniforms, bullet proof vests, and sadistic grins. 

Killer Dogs 
These German shepherds go right for your throat. 

Mutants 
Hideous human experiments of the evil Dr. Schabbs, these three-armed beasties are killing 
machines. 

Officers 
These quick, smart soldiers wear white and see red. 

Big Bosses 

Trans Grosse 
Another brother in the prolific Grosse family, Trans (said TRAHNZ) is so tough he chews up lead bars and 
spits out bullets. 

Barnacle Wilhelm 
This salty dog barks a missle launcher/chaingun welcome from his weathered fists! 
Don't rub his fur the wrong way! 

UberMutant 
The horrific jewel in maniacal Dr. Schabbs' sadistic crown, the Uber- Mutant is the per- 
fect soldier with four cleaver-tipped arms and a chain-gun in its chest! 

Death Knight 
You may be playing on Death Incarnate, but with two chainguns and two missile launchers, 
this guy is Death Incarnate. 

HINTS & STRATEGIES 

If you are going to survive Spear of Destiny, you'll need more than a trigger finger.

Don't Rush into the Room! 
If there is only one entrance, let the Nazi guards come out at you. 
They'll often be nice enough to open the doors for you. 

Get at an Angle 
It's never smart to run into a room. Guards are sometimes posted near 
the entrances and stay hidden until you move close to the door. 
Go up lo the door slide to the side at an angle, and pick the enemy off 
with less danger to you. 

Use the Keyboard and the Mouse 
Once you have the game down, try using the mouse and keyboard at the same time. 
The mouse provides better control for shtooting and turning. Also, the Strafe 
mode is much easier using the second mouse button. 

Charge! 
If you run at someone and shoot them point blank, you are more likely to wound 
them. Plus, this will provide less time for them to shoot you. 

Every Floor Has Hidden Stuff 
If you explore carefully, you'll find extra health and ammo hidden everywhere! 
Be sure to collect as much treasure as possible. Remember that every 40,000 
points will provide you with an extra life. You'll need it! 

Necessary Items Aren't Hidden 
The Nazis may be rude hosts, but they would never hide anything necessary to escaping. 
Elevators to the next floor can be reached through the normal passages. 

Don't Be Too Proud to Eat with the Dogs! 
After taking too many bullets, it's a wise idea to get help from anywhere. Eating dog 
food may be humiliating, but it will provide a small boost to your health. 

Use the QuickSave! 
The QuickSave, (FS) and Quick-load (F9) is an easy method of improving your survival rate. 

Conserve Your Ammo 
Although it's fun to hold down the Ctrl key to spit bullets everywhere, you should try 
to restrain yourself. Conserve ammunition and make your shots count. 

Don't Attack with a Knife 
If armed with only a knife, don't rush into a room that is full of guards and expect 
to come out alive. Spend your time looking for hidden rooms which may provide 
more ammo. The only thing thatseparates a brave man and a dead man is a well-placed bullet. 

Do More Damage at Close Range 
The closer you are to an enemy the more damage he takes with each shot. However, killing 
is a two way street. These Nazi guards have a way of appearing behind you with a point 
blank shot to your back. 

Searching for Hidden Passages 
Hidden passages can be located almost anywhere. Sometimes the entrance appears obvious, but 
often it is not! To make your search easier, move against a wall at an angle. Then hold down 
the spacebar and strafe across the wall. This enables you to check long walls quickly. 
Make sure the room is free of Nazis before you start! 

Secret Floors 
Within the castle are secret floors which can only be reached from hidden elevators. Be sure 
to examine every possible hidden passage for the location of these elevators. 
Secret floors are extremely dangerous, but yield tremendous reward. 

Does B.J. Need a Little Help? 
Out of ammo, beaten to a pulp, and desperate to survive? Press the MLl keys and receive full 
health, 99 bullets, and 2 keys. Beware, cheaters never prosper! 

TROUBLESHOOTING 

Memory Problems 
If you run Spear of Destiny and get an "Out of Memory" window, there are a few things 
you can do.

Remove TSR (resident) Programs 
If you change your AUTOEXEC BAT to not load TSRs, they won't take up the memory that 
Spear of Destiny needs to run. We recommend temporarily renaming your AUTOEXEC.BAT to AUTO, 
and your CONFIG.SYS to CONFIG. Then reboot your computer and restart the game. 

Load DOS High 
If you have at least a 286 computer and extended memory, plus DOS 5.0, you can load DOS 
into high memory. Simply put "DOS HIGH" in your CONFIG.SYS file. Refer to your DOS Manual 
for further details. 

Other Ideas 
Spear of Destiy will use XMS (extended memorv) and EMS {expanded memory) if available. If 
you have an EMS card or a 386 computer, check your system manual for information on how to 
make this available. 

Sound Problems 

A sound board is not required, but is recommended for playing Spear of Destiny. If you are 
having sound problems here are a few ideas that may assist vou! 

Sound Blaster Address 
When you installed your Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster Pro, you may have needed to change the 
default addresses in order to resolve possible hardware conflicts. Spear of Destiny can work 
with non-standard Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro settings. However, the program needs to 
know these settings. 

To enable the program to obtain your settings, set the "BLASTER"environment variable to contain 
the appropriate information. To do this either include the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
file or type it on the command-line before running Spear of Destiny: 

SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx 

Axxx represents the address of the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. For the Sound Blaster, 
it's either A210, A220, A230, A240, A250 or A260. For the Sound Blaster Pro, 
it's A220 or A240. Default is A220. 

Ix represents the IRQ number used by the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. For the Sound 
Blaster, it's either 12, 15, or 17. IRQ 10 (only available on a machine with AT 
BIOS and the Sound Blaster Pro) is not supported. Default is 17. 

Dx represents the DMA channel used by the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. DO, Dl, or D3 are 
acceptable values. Default is Dl. 

Try the default values first. If one of the values is out of the acceptable range, the 
program will Quit, indicating which of the values wasn't acceptable. Please 
refer to your Sound Blaster manual for details. 

Sound Blaster Pro Volume 
You may need to adjust the volume coming from the Sound Blaster Pro, You can do this by 
adjusting the volume wheel or adjusting the volume on whatever you have the Sound Blaster Pro 
attached to, or by using the SBP-SET program that came with the Sound Blaster Pro. If you 
use the SBP-SET program, see the SB Pro User's Manual for details on how to use SBP-SET. 

Sound Blaster and Gravis PC GamePad Problems 
If you have a Gravis PC Gamepad, a second joystick card and a Sound Blaster, it is 
necessary to set the jumper on the Sound Blaster card to "On" so that you are using 
the joystick port on the Sound Blaster. Refer to your Sound Blaster manual for details.
