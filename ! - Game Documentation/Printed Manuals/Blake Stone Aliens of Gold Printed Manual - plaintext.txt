SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 

Blake Stone requires an IBM™ or 100% compatible 386 or better computer with 640K RAM, a VGA graphics card and 
8 MEG free space on a hard disk drive. Joystick and mouse are optional. A Sound BlasteR, AdLib, or 100%

THE 22ND CENTURY STORY... 

As military agent Blake Stone you've proven your worth ten-fold to the Earth Directorate. 

You’ve survived more 'conflicts' than you'd care to tally and, of course through each operation, you've 
been absolutely certain that what is 'right, good and just' will prevail. However. . . 

...the Known Universe is growing rapidly. Earth- Space colonization and extra-planetary annexation is a 
daily occurrence. The Earth Directorate is continually met with the challenge of administration over this 
system-wide expansion. Martian Colony IV, Tlana, and System's End are examples of the most recent additions to 
Directorate control, as well as examples of its mounting burden. 

At times, it would seem, this growth is beyond effective management. True, the Directorate can be credited 
with a general rise in the standard of living and the increased amount of personal freedom and personal safety 
enjoyed by all her population. However... 

There's that word again! 

...evil can be found in the most unlikely of places!

THE MISSION BEGINS 
If you've selected New Mission and Mission 1, you've just blasted the Loc with your Auto Charge Pistol and 
are standing within the Lobby of the Star Institute. You will be given a mission briefing which appears on the 
REBA display attached to your left wrist. 

The following is a list of controls and commands for moving and fighting within the game. Remember, 
at any time you can press the F1 key to get on-line assistance. 

CONTROLLING BLAKE STONE 
Hey... it's grizzly in there! Guards, mutants, horrible generic experiments — all running amok. There's hardly 
time to think, much less stand around. Here's a crash course in moving — quickly! 

Walking - Use the up and down Arrow keys to walk through the complex. 
Run - Hold down the right Shift key and an Arrow key to run. 
Turning - Use the left and right Arrow keys to turn. 
Fast Turn - Hold down the right Shift key and the left or right Arrow key for fast turns. 
Strafe - Press the Alt key and the left or right Arrow key to slide side to side instead of turning left or right. 
Quick 180 - press the ENTER key or the W and you'll turn back quickly. 
Quick 90 - (Left/Right) - Press Q to turn quickly left, E for quick right. 

CALL TO ARMS 
Right, it's a fight to the death! But you're not going in empty handed. You've got a wealth of weapons—
an awesome arsenal! So... once you have more than one gun you'll want to choose between them for the most 
efficient use of force. 

The numeric keys 1-5 can be used to select a particular weapon. A graphic representation of your firepower and the 
keyboard/numeric equivalents are showm on the following page. 

1 = Auto Charge Pistol 
2 = Slow Fire Protector 
3 - Rapid Assault Weapon 
4 = Dual Neutron Disruptor 
5 = Plasma Discharge Unit 

You begin the mission with weapon #1. Until you discover other weapons, pressing 2-5 will have no effect. 
So, find more firepower! 

If the current weapon you are using becomes depleted, you will revert to the base level weapon — the 
Auto Charge Pistol. 

TAKE'EM DOWN! 
Aim your weapon at your target and press the CTRL key. That will blast 'em! This is assuming you're not out of 
charge power. 

If you are using the (3) Rapid Assault Weapon, (4) Dual Neutron Disruptor, or the (5) Plasma Discharge Unit you
can hold down the CTRL key for continuous fire. Bl...a...a...a...a...a...a...a...st 'em!! 

The accuracy of a weapon decreases with the distance from your targeted enemy. It's fairly easy to detect a 
hit — holes are punched in your enemy! But if your blasts are not hitting the target, you may want to aim to 
the left or right of them.

OPENING DOORS AND ACTIVATING SWITCHES 
To open doors and elevators, move in front of the door and press the SPACE BAR. 
Some walls in the complex can be pushed back to reveal hidden areas. To search for the push walls, move 
close to a wall and press the SPACE BAR When found, the wall will make a noise then slide backward. 
These walls are rare so be patient while searching. 

There are hazards which can be activated and deactivated by switches located on the same levels as the 
hazard. The switches toggle off or on by use of the SPACE BAR. 

Several of the doors in each of the facilities will require color coded access keys. The cards can be found 
somewhere on the same level as the locked door. Using an access card requires no additional commands other 
than the SPACE BAR to open a door.

GATHERING THE GOODS 
There's loads o' goodies to pick up in the complex. Some you'll need, some you won't. To pick up an item simply
walk over it. If you don't need it at the time, it will remain on the floor for the time you will need it. 

For example, if you are carrying the maximum energy stored at 100%, you won't pick up a charge pack by walking over it. 

GOING UP! (TO THE NEXT LEVEL) 
On each floor there is an elevator that can take you to another floor. There may also be a teleporter that 
can move you elsewhere in the level. Each floor in the current complex is locked and requires a RED access 
card before traveling to another floor. Once inside the elevator face the control pad and press the SPACE BAR. 
This will display the floor selection screen. Select the floor number from the keyboard. All floors can be 
re-entered. You can go back to previously explored levels and pick up things you left behind! 

JOYSTICK AND MOUSE CONTROL 
When using the mouse or joystick, use button 1 to shoot and button 2 to strafe. With a three-button 
mouse use the third button to open doors. Gravis PC Gamepads have a fourth button, useful as a run button. 

YOUR CURRENT STATUS 
The Blake Stone game screen includes two status areas. 

The status strip located at the top of the screen displays the current FLOOR number, the COMPLEX AREA name and 
the number of LIVES remaining. 

FLOOR 
There are 11 floors in each mission of Blake Stone. The current floor is shown at the left of the top status strip. 

COMPLEX AREA 
Where are you? This displays the area's name. 

LIVES 
You start each mission with three lives. If you die you will restart the level from the point at which you 
began. You'll lose weapons and points you obtained (on that level) before your death, but your health will be 
restored to the maximum. What a trade, huh? 

The larger status area located at the bottom of the screen contains the REBA INTERFACE display area, the EKG 
MONITOR readout of your health, the SELECTED WEAPON DISPLAY, the CURRENT CHARGE STATE of your weapon, and the 
ACCESS CARD DISPLAY. These displays and their functions arc explained more fully in the following section.

REBA INTERFACE 
When enabled, the REBA INTERFACE displays information about the enemy, as well as food unit selections, 
the current food unit tokens inventory, and current items which are being picked up. Also, REBA relays information 
on the Access Cards needed to unlock specific doors, displays Bio-Tech conversations and other general information. 
She's strictly business in the midst of battle! 

EKG MONITOR 
The EKG Heart Rate Monitor reveals the condition of your physical health during game play. Your mental health 
is your business! When you begin Blake Stone your Health is 100%. Each time your enemy inflicts you with 
damage your health is reduced. To restore your health visit a food dispenser or find a first aid kit. 

SELECTED WEAPON DISPLAY 
This monitor displays the weapon currently being used. The lower right corner also displays the current 
percentage of charge remaining. Weapon selection is made from the keyboard by pressing 1-5. 

CHARGE STATE MONITOR 
The current Charge State shows how much charge remains in your charge pack. If you are using the Auto Charge 
Pistol then it displays a WAIT message while recharging or a READY message once the ACP's internal pack has 
been fully charged.

SCORE DISPLAY 
This display is top right on the lower status area. You can gain points by picking up treasure or by killing 
an opponent. Every 400,000 points provides an extra life. That means there's a bonus for picking up all the 
goodies you can find. Collect 'em! 

ACCESS CARD DISPLAY 
When you find an access card, a graphic representation of that card will be shown in one of the five small slots 
located to the right of the ammunition count. It will be held for your use at a later time. 

FINISHING A LEVEL / AUTO-MAPPING DISPLAY (TAB) 
Once you have the red access card and return to the elevator, your performance will be shown along with a map of 
the floor. Press TAB at any time from within the game to see the map. Below is a legend which will assist you 
in reading the map. 

Flashing dot = you; Green dots = doors; Red dots = locked doors. 

ITEMS YOU CAN PICK UP 
Blake Stone has four types of items, Youil want and need to pick them up, ACCESS CARDS, WEAPONS & AMMUNITION, 
HEALTH sources, and BONUS ITEMS. 

ACCESS CARDS 
Access cards allow you to enter higher floors. They come in a variety of colors and have specific uses. Some 
may be easy to find, others may be more difficult. Red access cards are needed to exit any level. The yellow, green,
blue, and gold cards have varying uses which are described as needed. 

WEAPONS & AMMUNITION: 

AUTO CHARGE PISTOL (ACP) 
The ACP does not require a charge pack; you'll have to wait for the unit to recharge. It's a silent attack weapon, 
so skulk around awhile — firing it won't announce your presence! 

SLOW LIRE PROTECTOR (SEP) 
This weapon requires a charge pack for use. There is a slight recharge period between shots fired. However, 
it does allow for more rapid fire than the ACP. 

RAPID ASSAULT WEAPON (RAW) 
A medium speed repeat-fire uniL the RAW requires a charge pack. Like the SEP it cannot recharge itself. 

DUAL NEUTRON DlSRUFTOR (DND) 
This liigh speed repeat-fire unit is fitted with dual, oscillating barrels. It packs a wallop, but requires 
the stored energy of a charge pack. 

PLASMA DISCHARGE UNIT (PDU) 
If you want to dispatch some enemies P.D.Q. — use the PDU. With a wide range of detonation and repeat fire 
capabilities, this is a powerful weapon. It also requires an energy charge pack for operation. 

FULL CHARGE PACK 
These particular items can be found throughout the Complex. They increase your current charge by 8%. 

PARTIAL CHARGE PACK 
These charge packs can be picked off the bodies of dead enemies. They will increase your current charge level by 
whatever percent- age charge remains in the pack. Hey... fry a hole in your enemy, then take his pack. He certainly 
won't need it anymore! 

HEALTH ITEMS 

These items will increase your health, that is, if you're not too far gone already. They are as follows: 

FIRST AID KIT 
This item increases your health by the largest percentage. Pick it up and you'll raise your health by 30%. 

STEAK 
It's there, and it's not refrigerated, but steak raises your health by 20%, 

RAW MEAT 
Who cares who dropped it! It's food, and food equals health. A 15% increase is gained from this item. 

SANDWICH 
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce? Having it your way is not always practical. Eat it — it gains you 10%. 

CANDYBAR 
Is there a hunger inside you? This bitelet will increase your health by 8%. but we all knew that anyway, didn't we? 

BONUS ITEMS

MONEY BAGS 
Okay, so you say money can't buy you life, but these bags increase your score by 100. 

LOOT 
This item increases your score by 500. And it's just lying there? Wowser! 

COLD BARS 
Somebody's got a hole in their pocket! In varying amounts these items are strewn throughout the complex. 
Take advantage of their misfortune — it's tax free and it increases your score in amounts ranging from 250 to 1000. 

XYLAN ORB 
Okay... so it's hard to pronounce — they're worth 5000 in added score points! 

Remember with every 400,000 points you are awarded an extra life. What a deal! 

ONE CREDIT TOKEN 
You can use these at the Food Units. Pick'em up; you never know when you'll need 'em! The name says 
it, these are worth one credit. 

FIVE CREDIT TOKEN
Now we're talking serious prepackaged food items. Use these to buy food, thus health, at the food units. 
They are valued at 5 credits. 

The Food Units dispense items which can add to your health. To use them, walk up to the Unit and press the 
SPACE BAR. Now you don't need exact change, but the Food Units do require a token in order to operate. The 
REBA interface will describe each item as it is dispensed. 

FRIEND...OR FOE? 
You can be sure that most of the others whose path you'll cross are out to blast you back to the British Isle. 
A few, however, are here to help you. Of course, all the opponents will vary in weapons, strength, speed, skill 
and intelligence. Stay on your toes; you'll need to size up the situations as they arise. A description of these 
friends or foes is below. 

BIO-TECHNICIANS 
Many of these guys are loyal to Dr. Gold fire, which means they'll waste you if they get the chance. But some can 
actually help you survive. Valuable information, charge packs, or tokens can be gained from these Bio-Tech 
informants. Walk up close to them and use the SPACE BAR to gain the goods! 

SECTOR PATROLS 
The Sector Patrols aren't out to help anybody — especially you. This deadly pack packs the lethal Slow-Fire 
Protector. So... knock 'em out quickly. 

STAR SENTINELS 
"Professional" best describes these security guards. They are armed with auto-repeating rifles and they know 
how to use them. Oh yeah — they won't go down without a fight! Kill one and take his rifle. That's what 
we're here for isn't it? 

STAR TROOPERS 
The toughest of the tough. These guys are determined! With security vests to protect them, you might knock 'em 
down, but... they won't stay down! But then it couldn't hurt to keep trying, huh? 

AND MORE...AND MORE...AND... 
Surely, the future wouldn't be complete without a grouping of ghastly creatures to thwart your mission. Each 
mission of Blake Stone is packed with slobbering aliens, battle thirsty mutants, tech traps, guards and more. Be 
warned; they lurk at every turn! 

But, if we told you any more we'd spoil The hunt! The best way to find out what's in there is to get in there! 

Go on... fight already — the Known Universe is counting on you! 

THE MISSIONS 

If there is one major objective to Stake Stone, it is to stop Dr. Pyrus Goldfire, Director of the Star Institute. 
He's the villain behind the villianous plan. Intelligence reports are sketchy, but one thing is certain; Dr. 
Goldfire is ruthless, relentless and out to rule to the Known Universe. 

MISSION l:S tar Institute 
Goldfire knows he's up against the Directorate's best agent — you — and he's ready. He's unleashed his terror 
to battle you from the start! Now,.. if the savage guards and sinister creatures weren't enough, 
Goldfire has set loose the hideous Spider Mutant to finish you off. 

MISSION 2: Floating Fortress 
Your search for Dr. Goldfire continues. But you'll find his scheming has become even more maniacal as the evil 
doctor turns out more of his twisted creations. 
You might get past his first assault, but Goldfire is determined. He's serving up a 'caustic' creature — 
the Acid Dragon — to singe your a...ccess cards! 

MISSION 3: Underground Network 
You keep coming back for more! And more is what you'll get. The most dangerous mission yet places you in the 
depths of Gold fire's Underground Network. 
This cavernous storage area holds the secrets of his failed experiments — and the results of tests gone 
terribly wrong! He's given full reign to his host of hostiles and the treacherous Breather Beast 
Blast 'em (if you can) before they grasp you, then stop the Doctor! 

MISSION 4: Star Port 
This well-guarded base houses Goldfire's creations before their shipment throughout the Known Universe. You must 
knock out this vital supply facility before the evil Doctor 'delivers.' 

MISSION 5: Habitat II 
But... Goldfire has another plan. Teleportation! You must fight your way through an army of enemies to find the 
madman. But be warned, the Doctor has a surprise for you. The Bio-Mech Guardian is on the rampage! 

MISSION 6: Satellite Defense 
This is Goldfire's final battlefront and his most vicious assault. Your mission: survive and end the threat to 
the Known Universe from this evil sociopath! Watch out for the crowding achievement of Goldfire's warped research 
— the Reptilian Warrior!

MISSION STRATEGIES, HINTS AND TIPS 

Is Blake Stone too difficult to play? Or, do you just want to see everything in the 
game? Either way the following cheat mode will help you out. Using this cheat will 
give you full ammo, health, all the weapons and all the access cards.

To activate the cheat mode, type (one letter at a time from within the game) 
and then press the ENTER key. You may use this cheat as many times as you wish, 
but your score will be set to zero with each use. 

Here are just few tips to keep you blasting in Blake Stone. They may help save 
your life. At the very least they 11 save your nervous system! 

•Shoot PerScan Drones and Volatile Transports (VTs) from a distance. Their explosions can damage you! 
• Use PerScan Drones and VTs to damage opponents near them. 
• Do not destroy PerScan Drones or VTs around hibernating aliens. The explosions will release them. 
• Shoot at the crates with the Slow Fire Protector — this will conserve ammunition. 
• When entering rooms through opening doors, quickly enter the room and then back 
out. This will alert any potential ambusher and give you a chance to blast him first. 
• Interrogate all Bio-Technicians at least three times. The first time he'll give you a 
clue; the second, ammunition; the third, a food token. 
• Use the Plasma Discharge Unit to kill opponents around corners. 
• When shooting an opponent with one of the larger weapons, back away while 
shooting. This will keep you at a safer distance and allows more hits to wear him 
down. 
•When fighting opponents that shoot at you, keep moving side to side. In this way 
you can avoid some of the shots. 
• Kill the shooting aliens — locked behind barriers — before deactivating the barriers. 
• Try to destroy the ceiling turrets as quickly as possible when you see them, before 
they lock-on to you and begin firing. Use the RAW or DND to take'em out! 
• Use the save/load game feature often to get through tough areas. 
• The Fluid Aliens can only take damage when they are standing. 
• Don't loiter in rooms with electric sockets on the walls. The Plasma Aliens will 
emerge and attack— until you are dead! 
• Don't shoot any informants and you will be well rewarded! 
• Use the keyboard and the mouse to play the game. The mouse provides better con- 
trol for shooting and turning. Also, the Strafe mode is much easier using the second 
mouse button. 
• Remember, you can always return to previously played floors to retrieve items you 
did not pick up. This might be a saving grace when low on health or ammunition, 
•The closer you are to an enemy the more damage he takes with each shot. 
•Find all the loot. High scores receive extra bonuses! 
•Some push areas may require more than one push. 

TROUBLESHOOTING 

Having difficulty? See the BS-HELP.EXE file on the original disk for more detailed help. 

MEMORY PROBLEMS? 

If you run Blake Stone and get an "Out of Memory" message there are a few things you can do. 

REMOVE TSR (RESIDENT) PROGRAMS 
If you change your AUTOEXEC.BAT to not load TSRs, they wonT take up the memory that Blake Slone needs to 
run. We recommend temporarily renaming your AUTOEXEC.BAT to AUTO and your CONFIG.SYS to CONFIG. Then reboot your 
computer and restart the game. 

LOAD DOS HIGH 
If you have at least a 386 computer and extended memory, plus DOS 5.0, you can load DOS into high memory. 
Simply place 'DOS=HIGH" in your CONFIG.SYS file. Refer to your DOS Manual for further details.

GAME MOVEMENT TOO SLOW? 
You can improve the speed of Blake Stone by shrinking the window view (F5) and/or toggling off the floor (E) 
and ceiling (C) displays. 

MORE 
Blake Stone will use XMS (extended memory) and EMS (expanded memory) if available. If you have an EMS card or 
a 386 computer, check your system manual for information on how to make this available. 

SOUND PROBLEMS? 

A sound board is recommended for playing Blake Stone. If you are having sound problems here are a few ideas 
that may assist you. 

SOUND BLASTER ADDRESS 
When you installed your Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster Pro, you may have needed to change the default addresses 
in order to resolve possible hardware conflicts. Blake Stone can work with non-standard Sound Blaster and Sound 
Blaster Pro settings. However, Blake Stone needs to know these settings. 

To allow Blake Stone to obtain your settings, set the "BLASTER" environment variable to contain the appropriate 
information. To do this either include the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or type it on the command-line before 
running Blake Stone: SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx. 

Axxx represents the address of the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. For the Sound Blaster, it's either A210, A220, 
A230, A240, A250, or A260. For the Sound Blaster Pro, it's A220 or A240. The default is A220. 

Ix represents the IRQ number used by the Sound Biaster/Sound Blaster Pro. For the Sound Blaster, it's either 
12, 15, or 17, IRQ 10 (only available on a machine wilh AT BIOS and the Sound Blaster Pro) is not supported. 
The default is 17. 

Dx represents the DMA channel used by the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. D0, Dl, or D3 are acceptable values. The 
default is D1. 

Try the default values first. If one of the values is out of the acceptable range, the program will Quit, 
indicating which of the values wasn't acceptable. Refer to your Sound Blaster manual for details.
