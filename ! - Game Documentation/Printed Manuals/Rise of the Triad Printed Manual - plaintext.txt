You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High risk United Nations Taskforce, sent on extremely 
covert operations to possible trouble spots outside the three-mile boundary waters of member countries. You are on 
a routine reconnaissance mission on San Nicolas Island, located in the Pacific twenty miles west of Los Angeles. 
Your team is investigating possible cult activity in an old monastery, when suddenly troops pour out of nowhere! 
In the distance your boat explodes. Just before your radio goes to static, you hear desperate newsmen 
describing the systematic destruction of Los Angeles. An escaped prisoner informs you that a pyrotechnics 
expert and a rich movie studio head have joined forces with the Oscurido cult. Their plan: kill millions of inno- 
cent people for the glory of their master, El Oscuro. Having no other escape route, the HUNT heads 
into the monastery, taking the only course of action left: stop the Oscuridos or die trying.

FOR NETWORK PLAYERS; SITE LICENSING

When playing a multiplayer game (via network), each player must have a 
registered (legally purchased) copy of the game, unless everyone is playing 
the shareware version, which is free to “test drive" for 30 days. 

Any player who ts playing with an unregistered copy of Rise of the Triad 
(ROTT) is violating software copyright laws and should contact Apogee 
immediately to register the copy (copies) or purchase a site license (see next 
paragraph), or delete all ROTT files on the system and recording media. 

Apogee provides two ways to play multiplayer network games legally: 
(1) Each player must have a registered copy of the game. (2) A site 
license must be purchased from Apogee which allows up to the maxi- 
mum number of players to play a single network game oil a single system 
at a time. Call I-800-APOGEE to order your site licenses. 

A site license costs $89.95. (Sorry, there is no discount price if you’ve already 
purchased Rise of the Triad.) Here's what you get if you buy a site license: 

• A new CD-ROM copy of ROTT specially designed for network play. 
• 10 Additional Comm-bat levels. 
• Eleven command cards for quick reference. 
• A signed lifetime Site License Agreement from Apogee for Rise of 
the Triad which gives you the right to play up to the maximum 
number of players per game, or a single networked system. 

INSTALLATION 

To play Rise of the Triad, you must first install the game. The program’s 
installation utility will place all of the necessary files on your hard drive. To 
install the game, follow these simple instructions. 

1. Before installation, make backup copies of the original floppy disks and 
store them in a safe place. Use the backups to install. 

2. Place Disk 1 (or the CD) into the appropriate disk (or CD) drive. Type 
the letter of the drive followed by a colon and press the ENTER key. 
Example: A:<ENTER>. 

3. Type INSTALL and press the ENTER key. 

4. Follow the instructions in the installation program. 

5. After installation is complete, type SNDSETUP and press the ENTER key 
to configure your sound and music. 

6. Once the sound setup is complete, type ROTT and press the ENTER key 
to play the game. 

Note: With the CD-ROM version ot ROTT, the game can be installed on the hard 
drive. However, in order to play the game the CD-ROM must be in your CD drive. 

When starting, you will see a lovely introduction sequence. Once you have 
seen all you want to see, press a key. You will be whisked away in extreme 
comfort to the Main Menu. This is where everything starts to get interesting. 


NAVIGATING THE MENUS 

Rise of the Triad (ROTT) has not been called one of the most user-friendly games ever for 
nothing. Complete control has finally been put into the hands of the gamer. Through ROTTs 
Main Menu, you can adjust almost anything in the game to fit your needs. 

NEW GAME

If you choose a new game, you will be asked which of the five characters you would like to be. 
Your choice will determine how many hit points you have, how fast you can run, and how accu- 
rate you are with certain weapons. (For more information, see the "Our Cast" section on page 
15 and the “Starting a New Game" section on page 6.) After a brief intro, the game will begin. 

COMM-BAT GAME 

If you have a modem, a network, or a serial cable, you can play ROTT against your friends! 
To choose this item, you must already have connected to your buddies by running the 
SETUP program from DOS. Whoever is the “MASTER” (the one who called, or the one 
ran their program first) gets to choose the Battle Options. Each player gets to choose what char- 
acter they would like to use in the Comm-bat Zones. (See more about this in the “Comm- 
Bat” section on pages 18-19.) 

SAVE GAME 

You can save your game anywhere in a level. If you haven’t started a game, this option will be 
dimmed, and thus not selectable. Your saved game is stored with a picture of where you were, 
with the episode and area number that you were in. All you need to do is type a name or descrip- 
tion of the game to be saved, and press the ENTER key. 

RESTORE GAME

You can resume a previously saved game with this option When restoring a game, you are 
shown a still shot of were you where when you saved that game. 

ORDERING INFO 

Find out about Apogee’s easy game ordering information for Rise of the Triad 

OPTIONS 

There are four selections here: 

CONTROLS 

You can choose what input devices you would like to use, and reconfigure them to what you 
prefer. There are three strange items here: 

Adjust Threshold 
This is how far you can move from center before the input device says, “Okay, let’s move." 

Mouse Sensitivity 
You can move wildly or very little. 

Customize Controls 
Change what keys or buttons you use. 

USER OPTIONS 

This is an interesting section— under user options, you get to modify the game to suit your 
needs. You can change eight different things: 

Auto Detail 
If you want the game to automatically adjust the detail levels so the gameplay continues to 
run fast, choose this option. 

Double-click Open 
For the players of other 3-D games, we stuck in a double-click open. Use it if you’re used to it. 

Light Diminishing 
Is the game “just too dark”? Turn this off and all the areas will be brightly lit. 

Bobbin’ 
If the gun bobbing makes you sick, turn this off. However, it won’t stop shrooms mode. 

Floor and Ceiling 
If you are using a slower computer, you can choose not to draw the floors and ceilings; this 
will speed up the game. 

Menu Flip Speed 
Some peoplike to watch the menu flip, others just want to blaze to the next menu. 

Detail Levels 
Choosing a lower detail level will speed up the game if you’re on a slower computer. 

Violence Level 
Because of the growing concern with the amount of violence in games, Apogee once 
again leads the way with another industry first, a violence level adjustment option. 

You can now control how much blood you see in the game, from None to Excessive. If you 
enter a password, everyone else will be locked out from changing the violence level. This is 
provided for the convenience of parents.

Note: You cannot change the violence level while in a game. You must end the game firsts 

MUSIC VOLUME/SOUND FX VOLUME 

These user options are used to adjust the volume levels of the music and sound effects. 

VIEW SCORES/END GAME 

If you are not currently in a game, this option allows you to view the current high scores. 
Otherwise, you’ll have the option to end your current game.

BACK TO DEMO/BACK TO GAME 

If you’re not in a game, and you’d like to see the demo loop again, choose this. If you’re playing a 
game, you can return to it by choosing this option. 

QUIT 

Now that you’ve had your daily dose of death and destruction, use this option to quit back to 
boring reality. 

STARTING A NEW GAME 

After selecting New Game from the Main Menu, there are several options which must be chosen 
in -order to start a new game. The first screen is the Select Player screen. 

Select Player 
In order to increase the playability and choices for the gamer, we designed ROT with the 
option of five different characters to pick from. Each character has his/her own individually 
unique strengths and attribules. No two are exactly the same. 

This is not a RPG, however, ROTT does allow you the ability to play as a character that has a 
personalized history and even an individual personality. Thus giving you, the gamer, an 
option to pick someone who represents you better than the ever-popular generic player. 

Difficulty 
Next, you must select the difficulty of the game. There are tour skill levels to choose 
from. The different skill levels determine how quickly you are hurt, how many opponents are 
on a level, the skill levels, and how easy it is to see secret walls! 

After these selections have been made, the loading screen will be displayed while your system 
prepares the level. Then the game, and your demise, will begin. 

OBJECTIVE 

With the boat gone and no means of escape, it’s clear that this routine recon mission has suddenly 
taker a turn for the worse, and you now find yourself in a desperate situation. With no time to 
spare, and the balance of the free world resting in your hands, there is only one thing to do — blaze 
your way through the monastery. By seeking out and destroying this deranged cult, maybe you can 
save the world. And who knows, you might even live to talk about it. (We know this is cliched, but 
you folks don’t care about story do you?) 

THE GAME SCREEN 

Information Bar (Top of Screen) 
The Information Bar displays how many points you’ve earned, how long 
you’ve been in the current area you’re exploring, which keys you have, plus 
powerups and armor. On the right is a picture of your character, how many 
lives you have left, and how many life items you have collected. (When 
you've collected one hundred life items, you get a free life.) 

Status Bar (Bottom of Screen) 
On the Status Bar, we have two things; your health, which is displayed on the left; and pictured on 
the right is the ammo you have remaining for your current missile or magical weapon, with the infinity 
symbol displayed for bullet weapons. 

ITEMS IN THE GAME

Simply walk over an item to collect it. Items in the game come in four categories: weapons, healing, 
dangers, and useful items. 

WEAPONS 

There are 11 different of weapons you can get in ROTT. Of these, there are three kinds: bullet 
weapons, missile weapons, and magic weapons, Let’s take a look at them, shall we? 

BULLET WEAPONS 

Pistol (Press “1" to activate.) 
You don’t have to collect bullets in this game. 
Ammo: Infinite 

Dual Pistols (Press “2" to activate.) 
Two guns at once. Double your pleasure, double your fun! This’ll “Woo” them to your side. 
Ammo: Infinite 

Machine Gun (Press “3” to activate.) 
Once you have this, low guards are not a problem. 
Ammo: Infinite 

MISSILE WEAPONS (Press “4” to activate.) 
Oh, man, do we have the missile weapons. 

Missile weapons automatically upgrade. You can switch back to the bullet weapons by pressing 
INSERT (you may also customize this). You can carry only one missile weapon besides the three 
bullet weapons, and you can also drop your missile weapon by pressing the DELETE key. 

Bazooka 
Your basic straight shooting missile-firing weapon. Always a fun way to toast Triad terrorists 
terminally. Ammo: 10 Per Weapon 

Firebomb 
This explodes in a big X of fireblasts, shaking the very ground you walk on. Not for close quarters. 
Ammo: 5 Per Weapon 

Heat-seeker 
Will lock in on any heat source and head towards it. Handy for surgically picking off baddies. 
Ammo: 7 Per Weapon 

Drunk Missile 
Five missiles fly out with no clue of where they are going. 
Ammo: 7 Per Weapon 

Flamewall
As soon as this missile hits the around, a wall of flame springs to life and burns enemies to 
cinders. 
Ammo: 5 Per Weapon 

Split Missile 
Hold down the fire button and two heat-seeking missiles fire. Let go, and they split off at 45 
degree angles, plus the missiles both heat seek once split. 
Ammo: 7 Per Weapon 

MAGIC WEAPONS 

Two very powerful weapons exist in the game, borne of the magic of El Oscuro. 

Excalibat 
When one of the ancient staff-creating spells called for a length of wood, all the Oscurido 
minions could find was a baseball bat. Now it’s an enchanted baseball bat. You can bat around 
your enemies, which is pretty coot. But it has a secret power, if you can only unlock it. 
Ammo: Infinite Swings and 10 Excaliblasts

Dark Staff 

This is an incredibly powerful weapon. Little stops it, except thick walls. It destroys virtually 
everything in its path. A kinetic energy sphere, bristling with wild blue magic, shrieks toward 
your enemies. 
Ammo: 7 Per Weapon 

HEALING ITEMS 

Collect many different items for health. The amount of health you have is determined according 
to which character you select to play with. 

Guard Gruel 
10 Hit Points. 

Priest Porridge
20 Hit Points (Cold) and 50 Hit Points (Hot). 

Small monk crystal 
10 Hit Points. 

Large monk crystal 
50 Hit Points.

Healing basin 
Random number of Health Points 
{at least 25; up to 100). 

LIFE ITEMS 

Collect 100 life items, and you get a free life. Life items come in denominations of one, five, ten, 
and twenty five. Collect them all! 

lUp 
This gives you another life, or another death, depending on if you’re an optimist or pessimist. 
However, if your health is less than 75%, this will not give you a life, but will give you full health. 

3Up 
This gives you three lives. However, if your health is less than 75%, this will only give you 
two lives and full health. 

DANGEROUS ITEMS 

The environment in ROTT is not static. You will encounter many things to turn and run from! 

Rolling Boulders 
You got the idea, Pancake Boy! 

Crushing Cylinders 
If you are between one of these and a hard flat surface, well, let's put it this way — you'll have to 
untie your shoe, to see the enemy. 

Gun Emplacements 
There are two kinds of gun emplacements. One kind senses when you are near, then rises and 
-shoots at you. The other kind shoots in four directions as soon as you're near. 

Firechutes 
These launch fireballs across the room, which tend to interfere with one's traversal from one 
side to the other. 

Firejets 
Whether on the floor or ceiling, these guys blast a jet of fire into the air. To anyone standing by 
them, it ain’t the humidity, it’s the heat. Some firejets also move on tracks. 

Gas Grates 
Activated by a switch or a touchplate, these grates spew out poisonous green gas for an 
uncomfortable length of time. You cough, you lose health, and so on — unless you had the fore- 
thought to pick up a nice gas mask along the way. 

Heat Pits 
Filled with fiery lava, these really hurt to walk over. Anyone with sense wouldn’t walk over 
them, but then anyone with sense wouldn’t have tangled with a bizarre blood cult, now would they? 

Pit Traps 
They look like the floor, but walk over them and crack-blump, you have less health than you did. 

Spinblades
Big, solid, spinning, covered with razor-sharp blades. Need we say, "don’t run into them?” 

Slabbers 
Big circular racks of sharp spears, whirling out of the floor or ceiling. Note the little chunks of red 
matter on them. Beware! 

Spinblade Slabbers 
Okay, you’ve read the previous two. Combine them. 'Nuf said. 

Moving Walls 
As if the shooting guards weren’t enough, there are WanderWalfs that are out to get you. 

Firewalls 
They might look nice, but we would not advise leaning on them. Firewalls are as the name 
implies: they are hot, they often can move, and if you make contact, they will fry you like a chicken. 

USEFUL ITEMS 

There are some useful items in the lair of the Triad 

Bonus Barrels/Crates
Who knows what they contain? Healing, weapons, life items? Blow ’em up and take their 
contents. Crates are full of TNT; they explode and hurt enemies near them. 

Pushpillars 
You can push some pillars out of the way, by pressing the SPACEBAR. Or in the way, if you 
want. Some can only be pushed in one direction. Real puzzle-building stuff. 

Gravitational Anomaly Disks 
Gravitational Anomaly Disks are massively useful, and they're everywhere! You’ll see them as eleva- 
tors (EGADs), bridges, sky trains, stairs, ledges, and more. A combination of Darian’s technical 
wizardry and El Oscuro’s wizardly wizardry, they are quite helpful. Ride them, stand on’em — 
disk-over all sorts of possibilities! 

Keys 
There are three regular keys: gold, silver, and iron. There are locked doors that they open, 
which have the same symbol as the key’s ring. And there is a rare fourth key, the Oscuro Key. 
You never need an Oscuro Key to finish a level, but you can bet whatever it hides is very valuable. 

Switches 
Flip them, by pressing the SPACEBAR. They probably do something. If it’s bad, well, at least 
you tried. Some switches are up on a pole, so you have to get up there somehow to flip them. 

Jump pads 
Jump pads are pneumatic launchers that chuck YOU up into the air. Some jump pads work oftly 
once, and some fire at intervals, so you have to stand on them and wait. 

Touchplates 
Some floors have secret touchplates installed in them. They appear as dark areas on the floor. 

Elevators 
They will shuttle you to some other place in the level. Press the SPACEBAR to activate. 

ARMOR ITEMS 

Three armor items help you out a lot. Get them whenever you see them. They are time limited. 

Bulletproof Vest 
Bullets do not hurt you when you wear this. However, missile weapons can still kill you. 

Fireproof Vest 
Made of asbestos and other itchy, fire-retardant materials, this vest helps protect you from fire 
and explosions. However, bullet weapons can still kill you. 

Gas Mask 
If you flip a switch or step on a touch plate and hear “Release the gas!”, I hope you have one of 
these. Otherwise, a lot of coughing, unstoppable tears, and agonizing green pain will ensue. 

POWERUPS 

There are six powerups. they Significantly (but temporarily) change your abilities. How? Read on! 

God Mode (30 Seconds) 
Being eight feet tall, glowing, invulnerable, and able to discorporate people and utterly destroy 
objects at your slightest whim has its advantages. [Editor’s Note: this is not Jehovah, God, Allah, or 
any other god. This is a game. Get a grip.] 

Dog Mode (30 Seconds) 
Okay, two feet tall, furry, invulnerable, nasty bite, vicious bark. Trained well enough to open doors 
and go on the paper. Discover the secret BarkBlast! 

Mercury Mode (30 Seconds) 
Put on them crazy magic winged boots and run like the wind or fly into the air by pressing the 
Spacebar. 

Elasto (15 Seconds) 
Imagine you’re a superhero who can turn into magical rubber and bounce off of anything. Okay, now 
imagine you’re not invulnerable, and stuck in a bunch of narrow corridors with horrible environment 
dangers all around you. Not so tough now, huh? 

Shrooms (15 Seconds) 
Do not do shrooms. Your vision will wander sickeningly. The walls will start wiggling. Everyone 
will start glowing. Winners don’t do shrooms. [Editor’s Note: this is a powerdown in the game. 
It is not a real drug. It does bad things. If you’re worried that little Johnny will want to try them, 
this will convince him never to do anything of the sort, it’s that repulsive. And this is not reality. 
Once again, please get a grip.] 

Random 
Run into this and you never know what you'll get. For the desperate, or the thrill-seeking. 

One note: To make things somewhat fair, you can still plummet to your awful death off any 
mountain if you’re in God Mode or Dog Mode.

VILLAINS 

A lot of people and things want to kill you, so perhaps you’d like to know who you’re up against. 

Episode One: APPROACH 

Low Guard 
The grunt of the Oscuridos forces: they shoot, and when it’s time to “ask questions later,” they 
shoot some more. (Male and Female) 

High Guard

plenty of tricks in store for you, including racks of stabbing spears, and a big bad bazooka!

way of your attacks! (Male and Female in Triad Deluxe Edition) 

Triad Enforcer

nerve to throw grenades at you! Jeez! 

Boss

armed. He flies towards you in his battle throne, firing missiles ramming you. Try and attack

COMM-BAT

In Rise of the Triad, you can play games over your modem, network, or 
serial cable. For advanced features of Comm-bat setup and play, please run the ROTTHELP.EXE program. 

Starting Serial Play

number in the Number List and set it to Default, you can simply choose 
QuickDial Default Number. Once connected, you can follow the MASTER OF 
CEREMONIES text in the Starting Network Play section. 

Starting Network Play 
While future versions may have player/servers, HOTT requires a separate 
computer to act as the server for ail the players. This is so no one is slowed 
down by the server functions (making the game unfair), and also so no com- 
puter is required to have 16 Mb of memory (which it would need if it kept 
track of the data for 11 players and the game.} 

Starting The Server
Run SETUP. Choose Network Game. Select the Launch as Server option, now choose the num- 
ber of players that want to play and press Enter. 

Starting The Clients (Players) 
Run SETUP. Choose Network Game. Choose Launch As Client. Once the server finds all the 
people (and it will ridicule the people who are siow to enter), you can press a key and the game 
will start. 

SETUP PROGRAM 

Master of Ceremonies 
Whoever launched first will now be the “Master". Once everyone has selected a player and uniform 
color, the Master gets to choose the Comm-bat level, options, then Play Game, or Play Team Game, 
You can play a game to completion or the Master can press ESC and then “Y” to quit, and that game will 
end. Any other players can simply leave the game at any time by pressing ESC and then “Y’. 

In the game, press TAB to see everyone’s “KillCounts." The list is actively sorted. {Except in 
Hunter — the person being hunted will be displayed in the upper left hand corner, so you know 
who you are looking for!) 

REMOTE RIDICULE
If you have a microphone hooked up to your SoundBlaster, make sure it is set up, then hold 
F12 and speak in the microphone. What you say will be heard on everyone else’s computer! 
Otherwise, press F1-F10 to play the preset sounds. 

Messages
To type a message to everyone, press “T”. You can send directed messages by pressing "Z",
entering the message, and pressing ENTER. A list of all the other players will appear on the 
screen. Press the number of the player you’d like to send the message to. 

For message macros, press ‘T” or “Z” to choose everyone or directed, then F1-F10 to select your 
macro string. 

These are the barest rudiments of getting Comm-bat running. Please run the ROTTHELP.EXE program 
for a more detailed explanation. 

THE GAME SCREEN (NETWORK) 

On the status bars for Comm-bat, we have five things: On the top left, the 
KiilCounts leader is pictured with code name and current score; in the center, 
time and powerups; pictured on the right is your mug with your code name and 
current KillCount. On the bottom status bar in Comm-bat mode, all players

HINTS (Read at your own risk) 

If you’re having trouble and don’t mind having surprises spoiled, here’s the 
section for you. The following are little tips that once you know them, getting 
through Rise of the Triad becomes a lot easier. 

•To pick something up, jump on a jump pad, or activate a touchplate, just run over it. 
• Bosses can't be hurt by bullet weapons — only missile weapons. 
• On easier difficulty levels, pushwalls are visible as slightly darker walls. 
• You can see touchplates on the floor fading in and out. 
• If you are having an extremely hard time locating touchplates, try turning 
the floors and ceilings off. 
• The first boss. General Darian, can’t stab you if you’re standing under a 
light. There is a way to stop him stabbing. After that, if you can cover 
most of his escape routes, you can finally fight him on even 
ground. You may need to get into his room to finish your task first. 
• You can heat up the Priest Porridge by firing a missile weapon near it, 
causing an explosion, and thus making it more helpful. 
• Panes of glass break when shot. What if you run through them? 
• Find the statue with the knife. You will need it when the Overpatrol guards throw their nets on you. 
• if you can not find the knife, try shaking or moving from side to side in order to dislodge the net. 
• If you’re in trouble, save often. (You’ll be in trouble a lot, believe me.) 
• To finish a level, you either have to exit through the exit arch, or kill the boss. 
• There are several secret objects throughout the game. Pick these up for big bonuses. 
• There are some secret levels which you have to go through a secret arch to get to. 
• You can walk on top of pillars, spinblades, and fences. 
• All gas switches have a gas mask hidden somewhere in the area. 
• You can save missile ammo by luring guards into the line of firechutes or WanderWalls, 
• BE CAREFUL with the Firebomb in close areas. 
• Bonus Barrels have a gray Triad plaque on them. Normal barrels have a blue one. 
•If you aren’t in No Violence mode, you can distinguish Sneaky Guards from regular 
guards, because they don’t have blood on them. 
• Some pushwalls are hidden behind things you can destroy, and some are only pushable from 
up on platforms. 
• On the first level of Dark War, there is a touchplate to the right before the first door. It 
opens room with health and an MP40 in it. 

SPECIAL FEATUPES 

Jump Pads
One of the many unique things in ROTT are the jump pads. These pneumatic launchers are a key 
element in clearing almost every level. If there is a jump pad in the area, rest assured that it was 
placed there for a reason.

The Oscurido cult has used its evil magic to suspend objects in the air such as weapons, 
powerups, health items, and Gravitational Anomaly Disks — to name a few. Often jump 
pads are placed near items that are in the air. 

Statue With Knife 
The knife is a very useful Item when facing the Overpatrol guards. When making your way 
through the monastery, you will locate the golden statue with the knife. Walk up to if and 
remove the knife. When a net is thrown on you, the knife will automatically appear. Press Fire 
to use it. (You can not use the knife to cut anything other than the net.) 

Aiming Up and Down 
Combining aiming a weapon with the added feature of looking up and down creates a deadly 
combination. By pressing the HOME key to look up and the END key to look down, the gaming 
possibilities are now endless. (Press the PgUp or the PgDn keys to automatically recenter.) 

FIND THE STATUE 
Imagine walking along a catwalk, sixty feet up, and aiming a heatseeker down at your 
enemy... Or how about lobbing a flamewall over a wall into a room of unsuspecting 
guards? These are just a few of the things that can happen in ROTT. 

Automap 
To help with your bearings in ROTT, the game is equipped with an Automap. Press the TAB 
key to activate a top down map of everything you’ve seen to date. PgUp and PgDn will zoom 
in and out of the map, in the current level.

CHEAT CODES 

Are you having a little trouble? Hey, we designed the levels and wrote the 
code; we know how hard ROTT is. However, we are not totally sadistic; 
we have hearts. We’re not monsters, for God’s sake! 

Well, before you find yourself out shopping for a new keyboard due to 
frustration, take a moment and reflect on the reason you’re playing a 
game in the first place, to escape reality and to relax. 

Okay, if you find yourself being challenged, and feel the strong need to 
cheat, type "\BUM" to receive a few hit points and a few keys. Those who 
like typing can type “SLACKER" for the same effect. There are many 
more secret cheat codes. Can you find them? 

THE REAL STORY 

You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High-risk United Nations 
Taskforce, sent on extremely covert operations to possible trouble spots out- 
side the three-mile boundary waters of member countries. You are on a rou- 
tine reconnaissance mission on San Nicolas Island, iocated in the Pacific 
twenty miles west of Los Angeles, Your team is investigating possible cult 
activity in an old monastery in the tall, rugged hills of the island, once used 
for the location of the film Prayers in the Dark. Dressed in black, you peer at 
the ramparts, looking for signs of life. 

Ni spotted a man crawling away from the small mountain the monastery 
rests on. He ran desperately towards the team and fell to his knees. 

“They're crazy,” said the man hurriedly, “They don’t know what they’re mess- 
ing with. Darian, Krist — they’ve hooked up with those wackos, and they 
have these impossible plans but they’re really serious. They’re manufactur- 
ing ammo. They’re performing these rituals. They’ve planted bombs every- 
where. Some of them are already scheduled to go off. They’re not going to 
warn anyone, they’re just going to — " 

“Barrett, I’ve been listening to the radio,” Wendt said. “Bombs have gone off 
in the shipyards. The harbor’s in flames. There’s been explosions of major 
downtown buildings. And— -damnit. Heavy static. The radio's being jammed." 

“They have a mobile band jamming system,” said the man, “They’re signalling 
the bombs on their private, moving band while jamming ail the others.’’ 

Barrett grimaced at the bizarrely informative guy, then turned to the team. “All 
right, Cassatt, Wendt, get back to the boat, try the WB radio, and get to—” 

A volley of gunfire hit the rocks next to them, and the HUNT opened fire on 
the two sentinels that spotted them. The HUNT ran to the sentinel’s post at 
the top of the hill. 

Freeley kicked over the dead soldier. “What’s with the uniforms? These are, 
what, Korea? And the triangle, that looks like the logo of Triad Pic — " 

A huge explosion came from the island shore. The HUNT looked up to see 
their boat raining down upon the ocean. A dozen or so soldiers were making 
their way up the rocky path towards them. 

“Looks like we missed our ride,” Barrett said, taking a breath. “Okay, they 
know we’re here. The only way out is the way we came, and they’re coming 
from that way. No way to contact anyone, and we're the only ones who know 
what's going on. It’s my call. Let’s go for the keep. If we can get to their 
transmitter, we’ve got a chance at stopping it. And maybe we can take down 
the big boys while we’re at it.” 

If you didn't buy the CD version, you can upgrade by buying the 

"Triad PowerPack” 

There are two editions of Rise of the Triad: 

1. Diskette based, standard edition. (You’ll benefit from upgrading.) 
2. CD-ROM based, Super Triad. (You do not need to upgrade!) 

If you purchased the diskette based version, then you may want to purchase 
the Triad Power Pack, which adds these explosive extras: 

• 10 new, exciting Comm-bat levels, excellent for head-to-head 11 
player network, modem play, or serial cable! 

• A random level generator ("RandROTT"), which creates an unlimited 
number of new Comm-bat levels, as well as an unlimited number of 
new, action-packed game levels for single player games. 

• For Windows users: You’ll get several cool sound effects from ROTT 
that can be used as Windows system sounds, plus you’ll get several 
images from ROTT specially formatted for use as Windows wallpaper. 
Note: The CD-ROM version contains many more sounds and images 
than the floppy version.

action packed shareware releases. 

All this for a $10 upgrade price! (ordering details below}.

THE DEVELOPERS OF INCREDIBLE POWER 

Tom "Is My Eye Red?" Hall, Designer/Producer 

Tom co-founded id Software, worked on Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3-D, and 
DOOM, then came to Apogee to head up the in-house team. Tom is from New 
Berlin, Wisconsin, and got a B.S. in Computer Science at UW — Madison. Tom 
designed the game, and his iced tea must have “no lemon, no spoon”. 

Mark "Okay... Everybody SHOOT ME!" Dochtermann. Head Programmer 
A native or Buford, NY, Mark graduated from RIT while still having time to 
make a chestplate with animating LEDs on it. Mark did a co-op at crazy 
IBM™,©,®, then made the happy mistake of coming to work for Apogee. Mark 
did the amazing engine, network, and modem code.

William "Our Wagons are TOO Gone" Scarboro, Programmer 
William went to Texas A&M, where he studied Computer Science, Math, and 
Smelly Comestibles 101. “Food is Just fuel” to him, so he eats pasta, egg whites, 
and beans for almost every meal. He is working toward being a professional fit- 
ness instructor in between complex actor coding sessions. 

Jim "Wicked" Dose. Programmer 
Our master of sound is also from Naw York (Binghamton to be exact), and thinks 
the game is “wicked cool”. He went to Berklee to study some sort of musical 
engineering deal, then to a whole other college to study computer science. He 
likes Eno, root beer, and The Tick, but not necessarily in that order. 

Stephen "Mr. Explosion" Hornback. Artist 
Steve hails from Ohio, where he left a sordid past. Having worked on Duke Nukem 
and Cosmo, he was hired as an in-house artist once the department started up. 
He drives a spiffy Nissan 300ZX, and did most of the actor art in the game. 

Susan "Terrified of Left Turns" Singer. Artist 

From New York, too (Levittown), Susan has worked on the opening of Pee Wee's 
Playhouse and the Fritos Round-up commercial. When not taking classes or teaching 
them, Susan relaxes by taking more classes. She did the walls and female characters. 

Chuck "Chuck" Jones. Artist 
Chuck Jones is not THAT Chuck Jones, but he is a gifted artist from Dallas. 
Chuck used to work in a tattoo parlor, and has a collage of the many bodies he’s 
tattooed. Chuck did the “game over" cinematics and wide doors. 

Former Developers of Incredible Power 
These talented folks had to leave for various reasons. We’ll miss ‘em! 
Nolan “Donut" Martin, Programmer. Did the menus, setup, sound setup. 
Tim "Sony" Neveu. Artist. Did the killer weapons, intro, and end cinematics. 

Associate Developers 
Who did all these dang levels? Well, Tom and these folks:
Joseph "Building Climber" Sellinske. Did many battle levels, ate sashimi. 
Joe "D. Fish" Siegler. Did levels, petted his cat Flash, watched Red Dwarf. 
Marianna "Harem Girl” Vayntrub, Worked on game levels, Krist's chair, Mark. 

In-House Musician 
Lee "Rainbow Lake" Jackson. Wrote the music, also a World Champion Pun-meister.
