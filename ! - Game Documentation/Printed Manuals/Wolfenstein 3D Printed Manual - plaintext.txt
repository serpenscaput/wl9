ABOUT WOLFENSTEIN 3-D 

Wolfenstein features 256-colur VGA graph that animate faster than a motion picture. The 
controls for Wolfenstein are made simple for the user. Instead of slowing down the action 
with laborious and complex controls, we placed the challenge of Wolfenstein in the gameplay. 
To survive all you'll need is quick reflexes, a good since of direction, and a killer instinct. 

System Requirements for Wolfenstein 3D

Wolfenstein requires an IBM or 100% compatible computer with 640K RAM, a VGA graphics card, 
and a hard disk drive, A joystick and mouse are optional. A Sound Blaster, AdLib or 100% 
compatible sound board is recommended. 

Episode One: Escape from Wolfenstein 
The Story So Far... 

You're William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, the Allies' bad boy of espionage and a terminal action seeker. 

Your mission was to infiltrate the Nazi fortress Castle f iolleha miner and find the plans for 
Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist), the Nazi's blueprint for building the perfect army. 
Rumors are that deep within Castle Hollehammer the diabolical Dn Schabbs has perfected a technique 
for building a fierce army from the bodies of the dead. It's so far removed from reality 
that it would seem silly if it wasn't so sick. But what if it were true? 

You never got a chance to find out! Captured in your attempt to grab the secret plans, you were taken 
to the Nazi prison, Wolfenstein for questioning and eventual execution. For twelve longdays you've been 
imprisoned beneath tile castle fortress. Just beyond your cell door sits a lone thick-necked Nazi 
guard. He assisted an SS dentist/mechanic in an attempt to jump start your tonsils earlier that morning. 

You're at your breaking point! Quivering on the floor you beg for medical assistance in return for information. 
His face hints a smug grin of victory as he reaches for his keys. He opens the door, the tumblers in the lock 
echo through the corridors and the door squeaks open. HIS MISTAKE! 

A single kick to his knee sends him to the floor. Giving him your version of the victory sign, you grab 
his knife and quickly finish the job. You stand over the guard's fallen body grabbing frantically for his gun. 

You're not sure if the other guards heard his muffled scream. Deep in the belly of a Nazi dungeon, 
you must escape. This desperate act has sealed your fate — get out or die trying.

CONTROLLING THE ACTION 

If you've selected New Game and Episode One, you are standing over a dead Nazi guard. The door 
to your prison cell is unlocked. You are carrying the recently terminated guard's knife and 
pistol. Outside that door is a world of hurt waiting for you! 

The following is a list of controls and commands for moving and fighting within Wolfensiein. 
Remember to press the F1 key for on-line assistance. 

Travelling 
The key to playing Wolfenstein is learning how to effectively maneuver through the castle's 
passages. Once in the game, you'll need to move quickly in order to surprise guards and avoid others.

Walking 
Use the up and down Arrow keys to walk through the dungeon. 

Run 
Hold down the right Shift key and an Arrow key to run. 

Turning 
Use the left and right Arrow keys to turn.

Fast Turn 
Hold down the right Shift key and the left or right Arrow key for fast turns. 

Strafe 
Press the Ait key and the left or right Arrow key to slide side to side instead of turning left or right. 

Arming Yourself 
Once you have more than one gun, you'll want to choose between firearms. The numeric keys 1-4 select a 
particular weapon. 

The weapons are: 

1 = Knife 2 = Pistol 3 = Machine Cun 4 = Chaingun 

You start the game with only a knife and a pistol. Until you discover other weapons, pressing "3" 
and "4" will have no effect. 

If you are out of ammo, you can only use the knife. Pressing a number key will have no effect. 

Killing the Enemy 
To use your knife or fire your weapon, point it towards your adversary and press the Ctrl key. 
If you are using a machine gun or chaingun, you can hold down the ctrl key for rapid fire. 

The accuracy of a weapon diminishes with the range of the shot. You may want to aim to the left or 
right of an enemy if your bullets are not hitting. A healthy dose of vour victim's splattering blood is a 
good indicator that you've hit. 

Opening Doors and Pushwalls 
To open doors and elevators, move in front of the door and press the Space bar. It is not necessary to 
actually touch the door before opening it. 

Some walls in the castle can be pushed back to reveal hidden rooms. To search for hidden rooms, move against 
a wall and press the Space bar. 

Several of the doors in Wolfenstein will require keys. These keys can be found somewhere on the same 
level as the locked door. Using a key requires no additional com- mands other than the Space bar to open a door. 


Picking Up Stuff 
Though the fighting is fierce, there's always time to grab a few trinkets or helpful items. To pick 
up an item simply walk over it. You're smart and will know if you need to keep it. 

For example, if you are carrying the maximum ammunition of 99 bullets, you won't pick up more ammunition by 
walking over it. 

Getting to the Next Floor 
Each level contains an elevator. Once you find an elevator, press the Space bar to open the door. Then walk 
into the elevator and press the Space bar once again to move to the next level. 

Joystick and Mouse Control 
When using the mouse or joystick, use button 1 to shoot, and button 2 to strafe. With a three-button mouse, 
use the third button to open doors. 

Gravis PC GamePads have a fourth button that is useful as a run button.

is useful for attacking multiple enemies.

HINTS & STRATEGIES 

If you are to survive Wolfenstein you'll need more than a trigger finger, here are some tips to 
help you escape Wolfenstein 3-D. 

Don't Rush Into the Room! 
If there is only one entrance, let the Nazi guards come out at you. They'll often be nice enough to 
open the doors for you. 

Get at an Angle 
It's never smart to run into a room. Guards are sometimes posted near the entrances and stay hidden 
until you move close to the door. Go up to the door, slide to the side at an angle, and pick the enemy off 
with less danger to you. 

Use the Keyboard and the Mouse 
Once you have the game down, try using the mouse and keyboard at the same time. The mouse provides bettor 
control for shooting and turning. Also, the Strafe mode is much easier using the second mouse button. 

Charge! 
If vou run at someone and shoot them point blank, you are more likely to wound them. Plus, this 
will provide less time for them to shoot you. 

Every Level Has Hidden Stuff 
If you explore carefully, you'll find extra health and ammo hidden everywhere! Be sure to collect as 
much treasure as possible. Remember that every 40,000 points will provide you with an extra life. You'll need it! 

Necessary Items Aren't Hidden 
The Nazis may be rude hosts, but they would never hide anything necessary to escaping. Keys and 
elevators can be reached through the normal passages. 

Don't Be Too Proud to Eat with the Dogs! 
After taking too many bullets, it's a wise idea to get help from anywhere. Eating dog food may be 
hunriliating, but it will provide a small boost to vour health. 

Use the Quick Save! 
The Quick Save, (F8) and Load, (F9) is an easy method of improving your survival rate. 

Conserve Your Ammo 
Although it's fun to hold down the Ctrl key to spit bullets everywhere, you should try to restrain 
vourself. Conserve ammunition and make your shots count.

DonT Attack with a Knife 
[f armed with only a knife don't rush into a room full of guards and expect to come out alive. 
Spend your time looking for hidden rooms which may provide more ammo. The only thing that 
separates a brave man and a dead man is a well-placed bullet. 

Do More Damage at Close Range 
The closer you are to an enemy the more damage he takes with each shot. However, killing is a two 
way street. These Nazi guards have a way of appearing behind you with a point blank shot to your back. 

Searching for Hidden Passages 
Hidden passages can be located almost anywhere. Sometimes the entrance appears obvious, but 
often it is not! To make your search easier, move against a wall at an angle. Then hold down the Space 
bar and strafe across the wall. This enables you to check long walls quickly. Make sure the room is free 
of Nazis before you start! 

Does B.J. Need a Little Help? 
Out of ammo, beaten to a pulp, and want to survive? Press the MLI keys and receive full health, 
99 bullets, and 2 keys. Beware, cheaters never prosper!

TROUBLESHOOTING 

Memory Problems 
If you run Wolfenstein and get an "Out of Memory" window, there are a few things you can do. 

REMOVE TSR (RESIDENT) PROGRAMS 

If you change your AUTOEXEC.BAT to not load TSRs they won't take up the memory that Woifenstein needs to run. 
We recommend temporarily renaming your AUTOEXEC.BAT to AUTO, and your CONFIG.SYS to CONFIG. Then reboot your 
computer and restart Wolfenstein. 

LOAD DOS HIGH 
If you have at least a 286 computer and extended memory, plus DOS 5.0, you can load DOS into high 
memory. Siinplv put "DOS=HIGH" in your CONFIG.SYS file. Refer to your DOS Manual for further details. 

OTHER IDEAS 
Wolfenstein will use XMS (extended memory) and EMS (expanded memory) if available, if you have an EMS card 
or a 386 computer, check your system manual for information on how to make this available. 

Sound Problems 

A sound board is recommended for playing Wolfenstein. If you are having sound problems here are a 
few ideas that may assist you! 

SOUND BLASTER ADDRESS 
When you installed your Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster Pro, you may have needed to change the 
default addresses in order to resolve possible hardware conflicts. Wolfenstein 3D can work 
with non-standard Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro settings. However, Wolfenstein needs to 
know these settings. 

To enable Wolfenstein to obtain your settings, set the "BLASTER" environment variable to contain 
the appropriate information. To do this either include the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or type 
it on the command-line before running Wolfenstein 3D: 

SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx 

Axxx represents the address of the Sound Blaster/ Sound Blaster Pro. For the Sound Blaster, it's either 
A210, A220, A230, A240, A250 or A 260. For the Sound Blaster Pro, it s A220 or A240. Default is A220. 

lx represents the IRQ number used by the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. For the Sound Blaster, 
it’s either 12, 15, or 17. IRQ 10 (only available on a machine with AT BIOS and the Sound Blaster Pro) is 
not supported. Default is 17. 

Dx represents the DMA channel used by the Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro. D0, D1, or D3 are 
acceptable values. Default is D1. 

Try the default values first. If one of the values is out of the acceptable range, the program will 
Quit, indicating which of the values wasn't acceptable. Refer to your Sound Blaster manual for 
details.

SOUND BLASTER PRO VOLUME IS TOO LOW 
You may need to adjust the volume coming from the Sound Blaster Pro, You can do this by adjusting the volume 
wheel or adjusting the volume on whatever you have the Sound Blaster Pro attached to, or by using the SBP- 
SET program that came with the Sound Blaster Fro. If you use the 5BP-SET program, see the SB Pro 
User's Manual for details on how to use SBP-SET. 

SOUND BLASTER AND GRAVIS PC GAMEPAD PROBLEMS 

If you have a Gravis PC Gamepad, a second joystick card and a Sound Blaster, you need to set the 
jumper on the Sound Blaster card to "On" so that you are using the joystick port on the Sound Blaster. 
Refer to your Sound Blaster manual for details.
