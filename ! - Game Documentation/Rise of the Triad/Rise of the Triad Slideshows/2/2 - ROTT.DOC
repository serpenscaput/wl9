STORY
=====
You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High-risk United Nations
Taskforce, sent on extremely covert operations to possible trouble spots
outside the three-mile boundary waters of member countries.  You are on a 
routine reconnaissance mission on San Nicolas Island, located in the Pacific 
twenty miles west of Los Angeles.  Your team is investigating possible cult 
activity in an old monastery, when suddenly troops pour out of nowhere!  

In the distance your boat explodes.  Just before your radio goes all static, 
you hear desperate newsmen describing the systematic destruction of Los 
Angeles. An escaped prisoner informs you that a pyrotechnics expert and a 
rich studio head have joined forces with the Oscurido cult.  Their plan: 
kill millions of innocent people for the glory of their master, El Oscuro.
Having no other escape route, the HUNT heads into the monastery, taking the
only course of action left: stop the Oscuridos or die trying.

FEATURES
========
o Ability to fly with the Mercury Mode powerup.  Fly above your enemies and
  blast them!

o Super-high levels.  Up to 16 stories!

o Four cool bosses with intelligence, reactions, devious abilities,
  and up to four stages of attacks.  They keep coming!

o Over thirty levels of death, mayhem, chaos, terror, and so on
  -- Extra, specially designed levels for modem/network play.

o Ten unique, real digitized actors.

o Thirteen wicked weapons, including:
  - Dual pistols: One isn't good enough for our hero.
  - Bazooka: Your basic missile weapon of death.
  - Heat seeking missiles:  Kill guys around corners OR in mid-air, and watch
    the pieces fly!
  - Flamewall: Sends out a deadly wall of fire to toast everything in its path.
  - Firebomb: When it hits something, massive explosions blaze in 4 directions.
  - Drunk Missiles:  Shoot FIVE drunk missiles at once.  Better duck!
  - Lots more to discover!

o Three words: really cool explosions (15+ frames digitized)

o A rockin' soundtrack on all the major cards--featuring DigitalDrums(tm)
  (where available)
  Supports the following soundcards:
    Gravis UltraSound, All SoundBlasters, Pro Audio Spectrum, WaveBlaster,
    AdLib, SoundMan, Roland, Disney Sound Source, and many more.

o Tons of secret areas, difficult puzzles, and mysterious bonuses.

o Color translucency for glass objects.

o Far-out features:
  - Parallaxing sky. (Vertical as well as horizontal)
  - Look up and down (and AIM up and down as well).
  - Fog lighting effects.
  - Thunder, lightning, and rain!
  - Lights that illuminate walls.  Blow em' up and it gets darker.
  - EVERYTHING in the environment can be destroyed!  Break vases,
    glass, blow lights off the ceiling, and release your tension.
  - Mark the walls with bullet holes (Yes!  Too fun).
  - Huge levels of up to 1 million square feet EACH to discover.
  - All the boring stuff like: Light diminishing, light sourcing,
    and save games.

o Violence level adjustment, from low to excessive, with parental password.
  You might want to use this for the kids because the enemies explode in
  pieces of bloody meat, heads, eyes, hands, feet, ribcages and other organs
  in the excessive mode.  You'll definitely need body bags for this game.

o Helpless enemies.  There are some cases where you simply wound an enemy.
  They will drop to their knees and try to surrender or lay there twitching,
  trying to get away.  It's up to you to decide their fate. :)

o Great "super" save games that:
  - Record your level number for you so you don't have to bother typing it.
  - Keeps a snapshot of where you were in the game, so you can see it.
  - Oh, and save all that other game stuff too :)

o Multi-player abilities.
  - 11 player IPX network.
  - 2 players via modem.
  - 2 players via serial cable.
  - NINE Comm-Bat (tm) games, with thirty options to customize it any way.
    Games like Capture the Flag, Hunter, Tag, and Eluder.
  - Team or individual network play.

    You CANNOT imagine how intense multi-player mode is with more than 4
    players.  Try 8 or more.  It's insane.

o Choose from five characters--of different genders and races!  Players even
  have different attributes like accuracy, height, damage inflicted.

o Find gas masks and armor like bulletproof and fireproof vests.

o Fifteen incredible environment hazards like:

  Spinblades, firechutes, gun bunkers, moving walls, firejets,
  rolling boulders, pits and more...

  PLUS, you can fall OFF a level and into the valley floor.  Ouch!

o Jump pads add a new dimension to gameplay.  Fly through the air to reach new
  areas, collect bonuses or run away!  You can jump up to higher parts of the
  level and blast your enemies from above, especially in multi-player mode.

o Auto-tracking for shooting down at enemies from platforms and up at them as
  they fly off jump pads!

o Random level generator so there are always new battle levels to play.

o The entire game is OVER 20 MEGS uncompressed.  The largest shareware game
  ever made...and the bloodiest!

Rise of the Triad is the ultimate stress reliever.  No story, no plot, just
hour after hour of mindless, addictive action.
