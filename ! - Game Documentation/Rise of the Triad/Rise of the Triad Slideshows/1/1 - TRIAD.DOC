HOW TO RUN THE SLIDE SHOW

GAME STORY
==========
You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High-risk United Nations
Taskforce, sent on extremely covert operations to possible trouble spots 
outside the three-mile boundary waters of member countries.  You are on a 
routine reconnaissance mission on San Nicolas Island, located in the Pacific 
twenty miles west of Los Angeles.  Your team is investigating possible cult 
activity in an old monastery, when suddenly troops pour out of nowhere!  

In the distance your boat explodes.  Just before your radio goes all static, 
you hear desperate newsmen describing the systematic destruction of Los 
Angeles. An escaped prisoner informs you that a pyrotechnics expert and a 
rich studio head have joined forces with the Oscurido cult.  Their plan: 
kill millions of innocent people for the glory of their master, El Oscuro.
Having no other escape route, the HUNT heads into the monastery, taking the
only course of action left: stop the Oscuridos or die trying.

* Lighting effects like: Strobing, flickering, fading, total darkness and more!
* Up to 64 levels of light diminishing in the distance.
* Light sourcing creates pools of light from windows or any other light source.
* Modem play!  You can link up and play against your best friend or enemy!
* Full sound card support (including GUS, PAS 16, Roland, Sound Blaster etc..)

* Ability to JUMP over things, DUCK shots or other hazards and CRAWL around
  the realistic 3D environment.  Duke Nukem will actually FLY around his 3D
  world with a jetpack!
* Moving floors.  The floors and ceiling can crush you or be used as elevators
  to reach higher areas.
* Morphing environment.  Your environment is NOT static as in Doom.  Walls can
  move at will.  Rooms, or any areas of the map, can morph in to larger or
  smaller areas, crushing you or other effects.  Entire rooms can be changed
  into new structures.  Special effects can be created such as vehicles to move
  around in, or true hinged swinging doors that have thickness.
* Looking up and down.  This is an extraordinary feature that allows you to see
  more of your environment.  You can actually look up at the ceiling and blast
  an alien off of it, or look down to avoid a nasty hazard in the floor such
  as a pit.  Clues or objects can be placed on the roof and you must look up
  at them in order to see all of it and proceed.
* Animated environment - Any surface can animate.  Walls, ceilings, floors.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this preview.
