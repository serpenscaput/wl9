BY COPYING OR USING THIS PROGRAM, YOU INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO
THE FOLLOWING TERMS, WHICH ARE THE ONLY ONES BY WHICH APOGEE

DISTRIBUTING IT WITHOUT APOGEE'S PERMISSION IS ILLEGAL.

[1] OWNERSHIP.  Except to the extent expressly licensed by us,

in connection with it.

[2] USE AND COPIES. You may use the Program only for your own
purposes "just like a book".  This permits use by any number of
people on any number of machines to use it so long as -- just
like a book -- there is NO POSSIBILITY that more than one copy
will be used at a time.  You have no right to copy this Program
except for legal backups.

If this Program (including any related written material)

EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS SUCH REPLACEMENT, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WILL WE PROVIDE ANY OTHER REMEDY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

FROM IT, INCLUDING SUCH FROM NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, EVEN AFTER NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  Some states do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for
incidental or consequential damages, so this may not apply to
buyers of the Program.  This gives you specific legal rights,
and you may also have other rights which vary from state to
state.

consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and
