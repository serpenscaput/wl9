You are a member of the HUNT, the top secret High-risk United Nations
Taskforce, sent on extremely covert operations to possible trouble spots
outside the three-mile boundary waters of member countries.  You are
investigating a breakout of cult activity on a small island in the Gulf of
Santa Catalina.  Little do you know that your battle here is only the
beginning of the Dark War about to be waged.  Fight bravely and survive
the onslaught of hundreds of the evil Oscuridos, because you have to defeat
their well-armed and heavily-funded forces to reach their master, El Oscuro,
in the next game!  I mean--next mission.  Oops.

YOUR "OFFICIAL" OBJECTIVE

Vanquish the evil cult forces from the island and secure their stronghold.
Use whatever force is necessary to accomplish your objective.

WHAT THAT ACTUALLY BOILS DOWN TO

Travel through each area, kill everyone you can, and make it through the
exit arch to the next area.  Enjoy the happy irony of blowing them up with
their own weapons.


ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                                   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÙ

There is a lot of stuff in Rise of the Triad.  We've boiled it all down into
four categories: Helpful Items (keys and health and such), Weapons (bullet
weapons and missile weapons), Dangers (things that will fry or slice you to
meaty ribbons), and the conveniently ambiguous "Other Stuff" (anything that
pertains to the game that isn't just scenery).


                               ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                               ³HELPFUL ITEMS³
                               ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

KEYS
These are the most helpful items, because most levels have a locked door
that requires a key to open it.  The doorframe of locked doors has an
image of the key needed to open that door.  Keys are found spinning on top
of brown pedestals.  There are different color keys to look for.  The color
of the key will unlock that color locked door.

POWERUPS
Triad has a number of powerups and a few powerDOWNs.  They change your
behavior rather radically.

POWERUPS/DOWNS  WHAT THEY DO
God Mode        Invulnerable, 10' tall, fire Godfire.
Mercury Mode    Fly, be free!  You're not an Egg from Ork, but you can fly
                around.  Press PgUp/PgDn to control the height you fly at.
Elasto          Bounce off walls, have little friction.
Shrooms         Disorienting, dangerous movement.

Rise of the Triad: Dark War also includes Dog Mode and Random powerups.
Dog Mode is quite fun, with its abusively-powerful BarkBlast.

PROTECTION
It's a necessity these days.  There are three types of helpful protective
devices to find:

ARMOR           HOW IT PROTECTS YOU
Bulletproof     Saves you from those inconvenient skin perforations that
                your job seems to involve.
Asbestos        Firejets, fireballs, and missiles are a lot more survivable
                with one of these on.
Gas Mask        If you flip a switch or step on a touchplate and hear,
                "Release the gas!" followed by hissing, you'll really wish
                you were wearing one of these.

HEALING
You get injured, you need help.  Pick up these items for a quick boost.

HEALING ITEM                    HEALS YOU THIS MUCH
Monk meal                       10%
Priest porridge                 20%
Priest porridge hot             50%
Monk crystal                    10%
Large monk crystal              50%
Healing basin                   0-63%
1UP and 3UP (glowing ankhs)     Free lives (or full health, then free lives)
Life Items (silver/gold ankhs)  100 = 1 free life

There are four different types of ankhs (life items) that you can find.  Each
will add a different amount to your total life item count.  If this were a
nice printed manual, we could so incredibly show you what they looked like,
but we cannot.  They're all over the place, so you can see them really easy.
They are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, & 25.  Three of them look like anhks;
the best one has two rotating rings around it.  An ankh is an Egyptian symbol
of life.  It is not some sort of demonic or Satanic symbol.  This is only a
game anyway.  Get a grip.


                               ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                               ³WEAPONS³
                               ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

There are quite a few weapons in Rise of the Triad.  Most are devastatingly
powerful.  Here they are all in a row, in a format we like to call a "list".

BULLET WEAPONS          RATE (approx. Rounds Per Minute)
Pistol (Walther P38)    136
Dual Pistol             240
MP40 Machine Gun        400

MISSILE WEAPON          WHAT IT DOES
Bazooka                 Shoots a missile out.  Missile goes boom.
Firebomb                Shoots a missile out. Explodes in four directions.
                        Very dangerous in close quarters.
Heatseeker              Missiles seeks out heat sources: guards, fire, etc.
                        Many feel this is THE preferred weapon.
Drunk Missile           Five missiles leave your weapon and go crazy, flying
                        off any which way (but loose).
Flamewall               Missile lobs out, hits ground and turns into wall
                        of flame, turning humans into skeletons. Try aiming
                        up and lobbing missiles over things!  Aim down to
                        start the flamewall close to you.  Great for large
                        crowds.

Rise of the Triad: Dark War also features three more weapons that are
not available in the shareware version!

Split Missile           Two missiles fly together until you release button.
                        Then they split and heat-seek separately.
Dark Staff              Shoots out kinetic energy sphere that severely
                        damages everything in its path until it hits a solid
                        wall.  Will go through windows.
Excalibat               Knocks enemies into the air like Babe Ruth used to
                        do to baseballs!


                               ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                               ³DANGERS³
                               ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


The Oscuridos don't want intruders and have built lots of "intruder
deterrents", which is their term for incredibly dangerous devices designed
to impale, slice, incinerate, crush, poison, or melt the flesh off of anyone
nearby.  Getting the Oscuridos to die on their own traps is one of the more
satisfying parts of the game.

DANGER                  THE NASTY THING IT DOES
Spinblades              Huge three-tiered spinning blades that will damage
                        you a LOT if you touch them.  Some move on tracks!
                        Found on ceilings and floors.
Firechutes              Shoot fireballs out of wall.
Firejets                Jets that periodically blast a nasty tongue of flame
                        into the air.  These sometimes move on paths too!
                        Also found on ceilings and floors.
Crushing Cylinders      Big round crushing cylinders.  Found on ceilings and
                        floors.  Makes nice people pancakes.
Gas Grates              If you see a grate near a switch, be suspicious that
                        you will hear "Release the gas!" when you flip the
                        switch, followed by green, poisonous gas filling the
                        room.
Spear Stabbers          Racks of sharp spears stab at you.  Don't get caught
                        on them, or you will feel quite a bit less healthy.
Lava pits               Do you walk on lava at home?  No?  Well, try to avoid
                        it unless you have to.
Firewalls               Burning hot rock.  Touching it will not do much for
                        your complexion.

Rise of the Triad: Dark War features all these deadly jobbies:

DANGER                  THE NASTY THING IT DOES
Boulders                Rolls over anyone and turns them into pulpy bits.
Pit traps               They look like the floor until you walk over them,
                        then you fall through and hurt yourself.
Spinblade Stabbers      These are like normal big spinblades, except they are
                        constantly poking out and ducking back in their
                        hole, and we actually expect you to get past them
                        by running quickly across them when they're hidden.
Gun emplacements        There are two kinds: a gun that rises when you pass,
                        and fires in one direction; and a four-way gun that
                        fires whenever you get near.

                                 ³OTHER STUFF³
                                 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

THING           WHAT IT IS FOR
GADs            Gravitational Anomaly Disks are part technology, part magic.
                They float disconcertingly in the air.  Some travel through
                the air like bizarre trains.  Some rise up and down like
                elevators (EGADs).  They are building blocks the Oscuridos
                use to make a place they have taken over their own.
Jump pads       These throw you way up into the air, which allows you to get
                over barriers, or up into ledges, or to grab stuff floating
                in the air.  Some are timed, and some only work once.
Metal walkways  Iron catwalks are everywhere, another sign of the Oscuridos
                modifying the place they are holed out in.  (Out in?)
High switches   You may need to use a jump pad or ride an EGAD up to a high
                switch.  They will activate something, like open a door,
                move a wall, or release poison gas from nearby grates.
                It's usually good, unless you're on a level called "Crushing
                Walls and Choking Gas Pits"--then I'd be a bit more cautious.
Bonus Barrels   These might hold a weapon, some healing, a life item...
                They look slightly different than normal barrels.
Crates of TNT   They explode when you shoot them.  So do guards if they are
                nearby the crate when you shoot them.

GUARD NAME        WHAT THEY WEAR & WHAT THEY DO
Low Guard         Gray uniform. Your basic grunt enemy.  Shoot them.
                  Some are sneaky....
High Guard        Green uniform, with machine gun.  You just can't ignore these
                  guys for very long, unless you let them kill you, when you
                  can ignore them for quite a while if you like.  Sometimes
                  when they die, they will drop their machine gun, and you can
                  get it!
Lightning Guard   Green longcoat, with pistol.  These dangerous guys steal your
                  weapon, and sometimes use it on you!  Plus they run faster
                  than normal guards do.  Some of them carry missile weapons!
Strike Team       Beige uniform, with pistol.  These clever guys roll if they
                  get hit, so you have to re-aim.  Plus, they can roll out of
                  the way of missiles!
Patrol Robot      Built by technical wizard John Darian, these metal threats
                  fire slow-moving, heat-seeking drones at you.  Dangerous.
Triad Enforcer    Black leather uniform with big chain gun.  The worst of the
                  shareware enemies, they tear you up with a big chain gun,
                  then throw grenades at you.

The following enemies only appear in Rise of the Triad: Dark War

Overpatrol        Black Uniform with pistol. Fires a net to trap you, then
                  shoots you while you're helpless.
Ballistikraft     Indestructible robot pillars of death.
Death Monk        Undead servants of El Oscuro. Some fire deadly magic at you.

Big Bad Bosses of Dark War

"General" John Darian, the mad pyrotechnics expert.
Sebastian "Doyle" Krist, movie studio mogul turned cult pawn.
NME: the Nasty Metallic Enforcer, built by Darian to guard the lower reaches.
El Oscuro, "the Dark", evil presence awakened by the Oscuridos.

To say they are tough to beat would be like saying Everest is a
little tough to climb.

GAMEPLAY
Basically, you run around and explore in the game.  There are a number of
secret areas in each level.  Some are found by going up to a wall and
pressing Use.  Some are opened by stepping on a touchplate (a darkened area
on the floor).  Some are revealed by flipping a switch.  Some are hidden
behind doors that only open after a certain time has passed.

While the game will automatically aim your bullet weapons, you must aim
your own missile weapons (at least the bazooka).  Make sure you're on
target, then let 'er rip.

Most experienced players use the mouse and keyboard simultaneously.  Run and
turn with the arrow keys, then strafe (sidestep), fire, and look around with
the mouse.  Some like to run, others like to open with the mouse, too.

Those with a good command of the keys will have a great advantage over those
who don't.  Turning around on your own takes a while--all of which you are
getting shot.  If you know the Volte-face (or 180-degree turn) key, you
suddenly face your attacker!

If you see a big X light on the wall, that means that area is not necessary
to finish the game, and is in fact very dangerous.

Often switches will have Triad walls with 1 to 4 lights in them.  The lights
usually are also found near what the switch activates.  So, if a switch has
a two-light Triad wall next to it, look around for another two-light Triad
wall and watch what happens to it or near it when the switch is flipped.

NOTE: This section gives only the basics on how to set up and play Comm-Bat
      games of Triad.  For more detailed information, and info on how to solve
      problems in Comm-BAT, please see ROTTHELP.EXE.

Comm-bat means multiplayer battle over some type of communications port.

There are three types of multiplayer Comm-bat: serial (when two computers
are connected by a serial cable), modem (two people playing across the phone
lines), and network (playing with up to 11 people on a network--the shareware
version only allows five people at a time).  Here's how to get started in
each.

SERIAL SETUP
Hook a serial cable up to each of your computers.  Your serial port is
a wide connector that your printer is probably hooked up to.  If you can
get two computers together, connect them with a serial cable, then run
SETUP, set up your port settings, then choose Serial game.

MODEM SETUP
This is a bit tougher, as you have to choose what modem you have, and dial
up another person who is waiting with Triad running.  Since there are many
versions of the same modem, sometimes the initialization strings we provide
won't work.  Refer to your manual on how to initialize your modem if the
string doesn't work.  Once you get the right string, you'll be set.

Setup your COM port settings and so on.  Right now, if your comm card is
an older one, the UART will come up as 8250. 8250's are quite slow and some
hitching may occur.  All internal modems and most new systems have the
16550 card, which is very speedy and only like $30.  It is worth it to
upgrade for all the different communication duties of your computer, as
well as Triad.  A 16450 is extremely similar to an 8250, and some diagnostic
programs will report an 8250 and a 16450 as the same port.

NETWORK SETUP
Make sure you are all connected to the network.  Choose Network Game in SETUP.
Triad runs much better with one computer being a dedicated Server.  On that
computer, choose how many people are playing.  All the other computers choose
Client.  If you don't have an extra computer, you can choose Server/Client,
but that person may experience occasional hitches from doing two jobs at once.
Keeping track of 11 players is quite a task!

Once you get into the game, choose Comm-bat game, and the Master (whoever got
in the game first) will choose all the battle options and so on.  You can
quit out of a Comm-bat game by pressing ESC and then Y.  If the Master quits,
the current game will end and you will see everyone's scores in three tables.

You can play six more Comm-Bat games once you get Rise of the Triad: Dark War,
and you can still load in the shareware levels and play them there.  Plus, some
of the levels will have neat new stuff in them when you run them from the
registered version!

We all need help from time to time.  Here is help for you, if you need help
in figuring out Rise of the Triad.  If you don't, well, this is just wasted
space on your hard drive.

o   Patrol Robots aren't hurt by bullets.
o   All Life Items are gettable.
o   Often there's a much easier way to get somewhere. Look for ways to
    use a jump pad in the other direction and so on.
o   After you drink from a fountain or get a key, you can destroy the basin
    or pedestal!
o   1Ups and 3Ups, if you are hurt, will heal you with the first extra life.
    So if you want the whole set of lives, heal up full before getting them.

There are some of these and tons more hints in the Dark War manual.

BONUSES
You can get a lot of crazy bonuses in Rise of the Triad.  It's fun to
discover them on your own, but here are how you get them if you must know.

BONUS                  WHAT IT MEANS
Supercharge Bonus      Got all powerups on level
Adrenaline Bonus       100% Kills
Bleeder Bonus          used all health items on level
Skin of Teeth          ended level with 1 dot of health

Bonus Bonus            Got all bonuses

It is REALLY hard to get the Bonus Bonus.

There are more bonuses at the end of the whole game in Dark War.  They are
pretty tough to get, too.

Genocide Bonus         Kill every one of the same type of actor in the game.
                       This can be gotten multiple times depending on how many
                       different types of actors you can wipe out.
DIP Bonus              Collect all three developer balls (Hmmmmm....)

LEVELS
There are secret levels in the game.  One you can get to through a secret
arch.  The others require cheat codes to get to them.

Who are the strange people who assembled this collection of data that they
have the temerity to call "entertaining"?  Read on!

                       THE DEVELOPERS OF INCREDIBLE POWER
We got our name from a memo of Tom's about work hours.  At the end, it read:
[some text about working together well, and if we do...] We will be...
The Developers of Incredible Power!  It kind of stuck after that.  We don't
mean it to be bragging--we mean it to have a sense of humor about ourselves.
So many companies take themselves so bloody seriously all the time.
Anyway, here we are....

WHO                TITLE               WHAT THEY REALLY DID
Tom Hall           Creative Director   Designed game. Did most of levels.
Mark Dochtermann   Head Programmer     Wrote engine, comm code.
William Scarboro   Programmer          Wrote actor code.  A lot of it.
Jim Dose'          Programmer          Wrote sound code, some menu code.
Stephen Hornback   Artist              Did most of the wall textures, most
                                       most of the actors, and the cool
                                       explosions, and most of the items in
                                       the game. Also the Apogee earth
                                       background.
Susan J. Singer    Artist              Did many side textures, above textures,
                                       the female modem players, the five
                                       characters' faces.
Chuck "D9" Jones   Artist              Did the snake door, some cinematics,
                                       the Game Over picture.

                              ASSOCIATE DEVELOPERS
                        These people helped us out a lot

Lee Jackson        Our master musician won a world-championship pun-off. Twice.
                   Also spent a lot of time pining for the fields.
Joe Selinske       He did a bunch of battle levels and some game levels, also
                   spent too much time eating sushi and watching Japanimation.
Joe Siegler        He did some game levels, like Ride 'em Cowboy and Wall to
                   Wall in The HUNT Begins.  Drinks Diet Coke like most people
                   inhale air.
Marianna Vayntrub  She did some game levels in Dark War, Krist's chair, Mark.
Robert Atkins      He did the awesome printed manual for Dark War, and admired
                   Princess Leia in a "special" way.

                               FORMER DEVELOPERS
               These folks have left the Developers of Incredible
                     Power, but left their mark on the game

Tim Neveu          He drew many cinematic screens, the weapons, and the menu
                   pictures.  Dreams of working for the Moon Pie people.
Nolan Martin       He programmed most of the menus and the setup program,
                   and loved donuts.
