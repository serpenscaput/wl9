From the Office of the War Minister-

Great work Agent Stone! We had high confidence that you would stop Dr. Goldfire and 
his mutant legions from taking control of the Earth and eventually the known universe.


As for your next set of orders, I think you might find them slightly less action 
packed but just as rewarding!

Report immediately to BI Operations for mission de-briefing and award ceremonies. 
You will be given the Queen's Intergalactic Peace Medal of Honor! That's a mouthful, 
wouldn't you say Agent Stone?

Well anyway... job well done and thanks again Blake.
