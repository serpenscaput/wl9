^FN4^FCabConfirmed...I will repeat, Pan Crevasse. Although, your suggestion might be a better name for such hostile terrain. Currently, you are standing within the rover-module entrance to Goldfire's Underground Network.

^FC3aAssessment:^FCab This is the most dangerous mission yet. Goldfire did not expect you to survive the crash and cannot comprehend how you have pushed this far through his defenses......I read many mutants within this installation and theorize that this subterranean structure must house the results of Goldfire's early genetic experiments and could possibly be a storage compound.

Goldfire has placed a powerful Breather Beast guardian alien on floor 9 to guard the entrance to the Port. You must defeat the guardian to shut down the network.
