^FN4^FCab^FC3aAssessment:^FCab I can extrapolate based on his past behavior with a 97% probability. He has prepared many traps for you and is determined to stop you. He will spare no cost to end your life and the threat you pose to his plan.....Incoming transmission.....there are reports....of a secret transport facility near HABITAT II. If he escapes, he will be free to use the facility to attack Earth. His genetic experiments will be "shifted" en mass under Earth's planetary defenses. I deem the situation to be most serious.
