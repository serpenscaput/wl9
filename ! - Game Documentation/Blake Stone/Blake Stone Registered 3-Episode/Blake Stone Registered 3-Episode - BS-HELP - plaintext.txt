                     Game designed by JAM Productions, Inc.


                            ========================
                            BEFORE RUNNING THIS GAME
                            ========================

ţ This game is not designed to be run under MicroSoft Windows.  Windows takes
  up far too many system resources that our programs require for efficient and
  proper operation.  When running this program, DO NOT LAUNCH FROM WINDOWS.
  Run it directly from DOS.  If you are in the Windows environment, quit
  Windows and then run the program.  (NOTE: Using the MS/DOS Icon does not exit
  you from Windows.  That is a shell from Windows.)

ţ Any kind of menu program such as Dos Shell will most likely cause problems.
  We recommend running our programs completely from the DOS prompt.

ţ Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold requires MS/DOS 5.0 or greater.  Any previous
  version of DOS will not be sufficient in order to run the game.  The chief
  reason behind this requirement is that these older versions of DOS are
  incapable of providing enough conventional memory in order to execute Blake
  Stone.

ţ Blake Stone REQUIRES 605,000 bytes of free conventional memory in order to
  execute properly.  See General Problem 2 for more detailed information on how
  to make more conventional memory available.


                         =========================
                         BLAKE STONE SPECIFIC HELP
                         =========================

ţ If, when you start the game, you get the error screen saying that you have
  insufficient memory in order to play the game, go to General Problem 2.
  There is detailed help for this issue there.

ţ If you're playing the game, and it locks up when loading a level, try running
  the game using the NOEMS NOXMS parameters.  See the section on "Command Line
  Parameters" for more detailed information on how to use these.

ţ Not all clone sound cards properly emulate the Creative Labs Sound Card.
  This program was written for a Creative Labs Sound card, and functions
  properly on all Creative Labs cards.  During the testing of this game, it
  was made to work on these following cards with very little effort.  They are:
  Pro Audio Spectrum 16 and the Gravis UltraSound Card.  Other clone cards
  should work, but if you're having problems, please check General Problem 1,
  Solution 3 for more information on solving your problem.

ţ The music in this game is Adlib music, and all game play sounds are Sound
  Blaster digitized effects.  An example of the digitized effects are the door
  noises, your weapons firing, and the various speech from the people you'll
  meet in the game.

ţ If your IRQ is set to 10, you will not get proper sound performance, and your
  computer may also lock up.  Blake Stone requires that your IRQ be set at 7
  or less.  IRQ10 is a 16 bit sound IRQ, and since the sounds that Blake Stone
  makes are 8 bit, IRQ10 is unusable.

ţ If you notice the game running slowly on your system, here are a few
  suggestions on improving game performance.

  Ż Try disabling the ceiling and floor textures during game play.  This can
    be done by using the [C] & [F] keys respectively.

  Ż Reduce the window size.  You can do this during game play by pressing F5 or
    from the OPTIONS menu under CONTROL.

  Ż Increase the amount of free memory your system has before running the game.
    See General Problem #1, solutions 3 & 4 for help.

  Ż If you are a Sound Blaster or compatible sound card user, try disabling
    the Digitized sounds.  Press F4 during game play to bring up the sound
    menu, or use the "SOUND" menu under "GAME OPTIONS" when in the menu system.

  Ż If you are an AdLib or compatible sound card user, try disabling the
    Background Music.  Press F4 during game play to bring up the sound menu, or
    use the "SOUND" menu under "GAME OPTIONS" when in the menu system.


                      ===================================
                      BLAKE STONE COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
                      ===================================

ţ There are a few command line parameters you can try to use to help other
  things that might turn up when playing the game.  A command line parameter
  is something that you type on the command line after the name of the program
  you're running.  The /NOJOYS switch will be used as an example.  To use
  that one, you would need to start the game like this...

  BSTONE /NOJOYS  (or BSTONE -NOJOYS, or BSTONE NOJOYS)

  The command line parameters for Blake Stone are stackable, which means
  that you can use more than one at a time, if you need to.  An example of
  a stacked set of command line parameters would look like this...

  BSTONE /NOJOYS /NOMOUSE

  Here is a list of the common command line parameters you can use with
  Blake Stone, and what they are used for.


  VERSION    Ż Displays the compile date and version of your copy of Blake
               Stone: Aliens of Gold

  SYSTEM     Ż Displays and other information technical information about
               your system.  This is primarily used if you would need to
               contact Technical Support.  If you do contact Technical
               Support, please have this information ready.  This shows such
               information as if the game detects a mouse, a joystick, etc.

  NOEMS      Ż Used to disable checking for EMS memory.  Useful in helping
               to solve memory manager conflicts.  Is almost always used
               in tandem with the NOXMS switch.

  NOXMS      Ż Used to disable checking for XMS memory.  Useful in helping
               to solve memory manager conflicts.  Is almost always used
               in tandem with the NOEMS switch.

  NOJOYS     Ż Disable Joystick detection.   If for some reason the game is
               moving you in one direction, and you can't get it to go any
               other way, it might mean the game thinks you have a joystick,
               when you don't. When using the "SYSTEM" parameter, if the
               program detects a joystick and you don't have one, use this
               parameter.

  NOMOUSE    Ż Disable mouse detection.  This will disable the use of your
               system's mouse during game play.

  HIDDENCARD Ż This switch overrides the video card detection routines if the
               program seems to be improperly detecting your video card and not
               letting you play the game.


                               ==================
                               GENERAL PROBLEM #1
                               ==================

ţ Problem

The game locks up either during game play, or during the loading process.

ţ Explanation 1

This can be any number of things, but is usually a conflict with a memory
manager, or a TSR(s) in your system.  It can also be a DMA conflict if you have
a Sound Blaster Sound card.  Apogee only directly supports the Sound Blaster
and AdLib family of cards, and any other card has to have 100% compatibility in
order to function properly.  Many other sound cards out claim to be 100%
compatible with the Sound Blaster standard, but in reality they are not.

ţ Solution 1

Try running the game with the NOEMS NOXMS command line parameters.  See the
section on "COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS" for more information on how to properly
use these.

ţ Solution 2

Turn off the digitized sounds completely.  If the game plays normally, a DMA
conflict most likely exists between your sound card and some other piece of
hardware in your computer.  You will need to change the DMA channel in order to
solve the DMA conflict.  Consult your sound card manual for instructions on how
to do this.  If you do indeed change the DMA channel, you must reflect said
change in the SET BLASTER line mentioned in the next solution.

ţ Solution 3

Check your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to see if the SET BLASTER line is present.  If it
is not, this could be the source of the problem.  Even if you don't have a
Sound Blaster card, this line needs to be there.  The reason for this is that
the game expects your sound card to be at a certain default setting.  If it
isn't, the game looks for the environment variable BLASTER, and redirects the
sound output to those settings.  If you are not on the default settings, and
you don't have the proper SET BLASTER line, or it isn't there at all, a system
lockup may occur.

  SET BLASTER=Aw Ix Dy Tz

  Where w is the Address Number. (It's almost always 220)
  Where y is the DMA Channel (Almost always is 1)
  Where x is the Interrupt Number (it must be 7, 5, or 2.)
  Where z is the type of card.

  z should be either 1 or 3 if it's a Sound Blaster (1 for an old card)
  z should be either 2 or 4 if it's a Sound Blaster Pro (2 for an old card)
  z should be 6 if it's a Sound Blaster 16
  z should be 1 if it's a sound card other than a Creative Labs card
    (if 1 doesn't work, try 3)

  If you have a Sound Blaster 16, the D refers to the 8-bit DMA channel, not
  the 16 Bit DMA channel.  That's stored under a different variable, and is
  not used in any Apogee game.

Please note that at this time, no Apogee game supports an interrupt higher than
7.  If you do have the SET BLASTER line present, and the interrupt is higher
than 7, you MUST change it to 7 or lower, or you will continue to experience
problems.   Once you have made this change to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you'll
need to reboot your computer for these changes to take effect.  After
rebooting, go to the directory the game is installed in, and delete the config
file for this game.  (For the shareware episode, it's CONFIG.BS1; for the
registered versions, it's either CONFIG.BS3, or CONFIG.BS6 depending on how
many episodes you have.)  The config file stores the configuration information
for your system, and if you delete this file, it will force the game to rescan
your computer, and get the new information.  The new information will then be
placed in a newly created configuration file.  Any settings such as keyboard
reassignments, or control device selections will be lost when the configuration file is
deleted, and will need to be reselected.


                               ==================
                               GENERAL PROBLEM #2
                               ==================

ţ Problem

The program returns a message that says you do not have enough memory to run
the game, or the program behaves erratically when it is executed.

ţ Explanation

There is not enough conventional memory available to execute the game you are
attempting to run.  When MicroSoft first made DOS 1.0, 640 kilobytes (KB) was
set aside as the highest amount of memory that a computer could have.  The
640KB of memory is what is called "conventional memory".  To maintain
compatibility with older versions, this was never changed.  Advances in memory
management have made access to memory beyond 640KB, but this memory can only
hold data; the program actually has to run in the first 640KB.  It is this
memory that you are running out of.

Conventional memory is used by DOS as well as device drivers and TSR's
(Terminate and Stay Resident Programs).  A TSR is a program that is loaded into
your computer's memory (usually from the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files) and
stays there.  Most programs remove themselves from memory after execution, a
TSR does not.  Device drivers and TSR's are programs that enable the computer to
use additional hardware such as a mouse, scanner, CD-ROM, expanded or extended
memory, etc.  When you first start up your computer, there are two files that
your computer looks at: CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.  These two files contain
lists of device drivers and TSR's that are loaded into memory.

NOTE: It is possible that Apogee games may run with a figure of available
conventional memory that is less than the recommended amount.  It is very
likely, however that the program will behave erratically under these
conditions.  Even if the game appears to run with less than the recommended
amount of conventional memory, we recommend that you raise your amount of
conventional memory to ensure proper program execution.

ţ Solution 1

Try removing some of your TSR's.

ţ Solution 2

Make sure "DOS=HIGH" is in your CONFIG.SYS file.  This will load your DOS into
high memory, and will make more room available in the first 640k of memory
mentioned in the explanation above.  This alone usually isn't enough to solve
the problem, but sometimes it will work.

ţ Solution 3

If you are running MS/DOS 6+, skip directly to Solution 4.

a) If you are running a version of Stacker before v3.1, or some similar disk
   compression program that loads after your CONFIG.SYS file, copy our product
   to a section of your hard drive that is not compressed.  Stacker v3.1+, or
   similar compression programs that load before CONFIG.SYS do not need their
   files moved.
b) Place a diskette in drive A:.  (If A: is a High Density Drive, you'll need
   a high density diskette).
c) Switch to the C: prompt.
d) Type FORMAT A: /S
e) If necessary, press enter for the question about Volume Label.
f) Enter N to "Format another?"
g) LEAVE THIS DISKETTE IN YOUR A: DRIVE, and reboot your computer.
h) The computer should ask you for the date and the time.  Just press enter to
   these questions.  At this point, you will be at the A: prompt.  Now, switch
   to the C: drive, then change to the directory in which the game is installed
   and start the game.  You should no longer have this problem.  Please note
   that if this solution solves the problem, you will need to do this every
   time you wish to play the game.

ţ Solution 4

This Solution is for MS/DOS 6.0+ users only.
 
a) If you are running a version of Stacker before v3.1, or some similar disk
   compression program that loads after your CONFIG.SYS file, copy our product
   to a section of your hard drive that is not compressed.  Stacker v3.1+, or
   similar compression programs that load before CONFIG.SYS do not need their
   files moved.
b) Reboot your computer.
c) When the message "Starting MS/DOS" appears, hold down the F5 key.  This
   does the same thing as steps 2 through 7 in Solution 3.  If your system
   boots normally, you waited too long to hit the F5 key. Reboot and try again.
d) If you are running MicroSoft DOS v6.2 and also are using DoubleSpace, you
   can press Ctrl-F5, and this will also bypass loading your DoubleSpace
   driver.  However, if you do this, you won't be able to get at your
   compressed drive.  If you use this step, please make sure that you've copied
   the game to an uncompressed drive on your computer.  Please note that this
   step is ONLY for DoubleSpace users who are using MS/DOS 6.2.  This will not
   work if you're using Stacker or any other disk compression program besides
   DoubleSpace.
d) You should see a message that says "MS/DOS is bypassing your CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files".  (If your system boots normally, you waited too long.
   Reboot, and try again.)
e) Switch to the C: drive, then change to the directory in which the game is
   installed and start the game.  Please note that if this solution solves the
   problem, then you will need to do this every time you wish to play the game.

NOTE: If you have a PS/1, and these steps do not work for you, please contact
IBM's Technical Support Department in order to find out how to boot from a
System Disk, since the procedure is extremely different and much more
complicated than what is described above.
