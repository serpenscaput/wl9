 INTRODUCTION
 
 Earth's fighting days were believed to be over.  Most of America's military 
 funds were now being directed toward research and space exploration.  
 In 2012, Dr. Donald Fox, a U.S. exobiologist on one of the first manned 
 missions to Mars, returned with a metallic object taken from an area near 
 one of Mars' curious, face-like formations.  It was the first hard proof 
 that life existed outside earth's solar system.  Scientists were elated 
 but the government, ever so cautious, removed the artifact to an 
 underground research facility called Delta Base.  Delta Base, a small 
 weapons development and research center located in the Nevada desert, is the
 only facility with equipment to test such an object.  The object was taken
 to the lowest level, a maze-like series of hallways and test chambers, to 
 the laboratory known as Corridor 7.
 
 The age of the object was impossible to determine.  Most scientists believed 
 it to be ancient, but it showed no traces of its age and its surface could 
 not be sampled, even at the molecular level.  The standard battery of tests
 were issued.  In the back of the chamber the object was subjected to varying
 levels and types of radiation.  During the Gamma phase of the tests, the 
 object began to change.
 
 The Invasion Begins....
 
 Most of the lab in Corridor 7 was destroyed.  The object changed and grew in 
 size as personnel in the upper levels watched their monitors in astonishment.  
 It began to resemble a ball of lightning.
 
 The base was put on alert.  The sphere seemed to power itself, and no one 
 knew how to shut it down, nor did they have the time.  From inside the 
 object something emerged . . short, humanoid in form, but clearly not 
 human . . carrying what was unmistakably a weapon in one of its arms.
 
 Alien invaders rushed through the object's opening and seized the base.  
 The artifact was a trap planted thousands of years earlier by the aliens to 
 inform them of the presence of advanced races.  They launched the objects in 
 small foldspace cruisers programmed to seek hospitable solar systems, and in 
 Earth's case, the gate device was planted on Mars.  When Earth's fledging 
 culture reached the spacefaring stage, discovery was inevitable.
 
 The aliens wiped out the base personnel.  Currently, alien technicians are 
 almost finished installing a device that creates an impenetrable shield around 
 the base, allowing them time to move in more troops, assess the environment, 
 and change it to suit their needs.  While Earth has developed some advanced 
 weapons, they pale next to the aliens' technology.  Conquest looms ahead.  
 They will destroy and enslave the populace and plunder our resources.
 
 Your Mission
 
 Headquarters does not realize what has happened inside the base.  
 You are an experienced special forces marine given immediate orders to enter 
 the research facility, proceed to the 30th floor, to Corridor 7, assess the 
 situation and regain communication with the outside world.
 
 After a brief helicopter trip, you're face to face with Delta Base.  
 Communicating with HQ, you are informed that a large energy force has been 
 detected underground, too large to be man made.  Just then, your 
 communications are cut as a blue haze surrounds the facility.  The air 
 becomes thick and your lungs feel the pressure.  Your only option now is to 
 enter the base, proceed to the last level, and destroy the object.
 
 Against the Odds
 
 Several factors are working in your favor.  First, you have the element of 
 surprise; they don't know you're there.  Second, they believe they've killed 
 everyone and are now busy modifying the base to suit their needs. They have 
 posted sentries around the upper levels as safeguards against any possible 
 survivors, so they are not worried about someone as out numbered and 
 insignificant as yourself.  The further you descend, more signs of alien 
 habitation are apparent; walls have been modified to resemble the alien's 
 home environment; alien weapons and munitions are available.
 
 While the aliens vary in size, shape and color, they all have one element in 
 common; they are geared for war.  Some aliens may look deceiving, but they 
 are armed with weapons beyond our capabilities, moving with speed and in 
 numbers.  To add  to the tension, some aliens are invisible. Only your 
 infrared vision goggles can aid you in their detection. If you are smart, you 
 will learn their habits, adapt and overcome their strengths.  Out-gunned and 
 alone, can you survive the slaughter and repel the aliens with only pure 
 courage?  Your life is on the line as the country fears what they do not know. 
 Only you can decide our fate. Good luck . .   
 
 
 
 1.  NEW MISSION
 This selection will allow you to begin a new game.  Select the level of 
 difficulty on this screen by the appropriate rank:
 
 Corporal        
 This is the easiest level.  It contains the fewest aliens, body armor, and
 a full map.  You must eliminate 10% of the initial aliens to gain access 
 to the next level.  Recommended for first time gamers.
 
 Lieutenant
 This level is a little more challenging. There is no body armor but a map
 will be given.  You must eliminate 75% of the initial aliens to gain 
 access to the next level.  Recommended for non-arcade players.
 
 Captain
 This is the best level of play.  The map will only show a partial view until 
 the floor map is found.  You must eliminate all of the aliens to proceed to 
 the next level.  This level will pose a challenge to most gamers.
 
 Major
 This is the toughest level, recommended for those with patience and the 
 desire to succeed against the odds.  It will contain the most number of
 aliens and they will be harder to kill.         
 
 President
 By picking this level, the computer will randomly relocate the aliens and 
 items for each level.  The random factor is the distance the same alien 
 (or item) will be placed from its original position.  The higher the number, 
 the farther it could be.
 
 Network 
 This will allow you to play over a network.  Select the alien you wish to be 
 and fight it out to the death with as many players as your network can handle.  
 There are 10 levels especially designed for network and modem duels.  
 
 Note: that each character has different abilities such as damage, speed and 
 health. 
 
 Network Requirements
  You must be using an IPX compatible network card with the drivers loaded.
  If you wish to play two different games, simultaneously, you can edit the 
  IPX SOCKET number in the CHARACTER selection mode by typing in a different 
  number.  Just make sure the other members you wish to have in your game are 
  using the same SOCKET# as you.
 
 NOTE:  Playing in the Network mode can and will slow down other network 
        users, especially in high graphic enviroments.
 
 
 Network Teams
 This selection uses the same maps as the network play.  Players who select 
 the same character to control cannot kill each other.  Your kills recorded 
 are tallied for the whole group, not an individual.
 
 Modem           
 You may now be able to duel a friend head to head, via a 9600 baud or
 greater modem.  The menu selection is self explanatory.  Choose the
 approriate settings for your modem.  If the IRQ or the ADDRESS settings
 are not listed, use the custom box at the bottom of the column.
 
 To call a person, press the alt d keys to dial.  The other person needs to 
 be ready to play in the modem game selection as well.  Corridor 7 has an 
 auto answer mode, but the alt a keys can be pressed to override the mode.
 
 2.  Adjust Audio
 This selection will allow you to adjust the CD audio controls if you are 
 currently using the Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, or the Logitech 
 Soundman.  You will not be able to adjust the audio from the screen 
 selections if you do not have one of the above sound cards.  You may move 
 the cursor to any slider with the UP and DOWN arrow keys and adjust it with 
 the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.
 
 Fm music volume  Adjust the background music here.
 
 Sound fx volume  This bar will adjust the digitized sound effects such as
 gun fire and death tracks.
 
 Line in volume  Your CD player must be plugged into the line in slot on 
 the CD player (mostly used in external models).
 
 Master volume  This switch takes control of all the sound settings at once.
 
 
 3. Adjust Visual
 This selection will allow you to adjust your visual display.  The following 
 changes are possible:
 
 SCREEN SIZE  The largest screen will give the best visual effects.  
 For slower machines, reduce the screen for a faster response. 
 
 NOTE:  The status bar in the maximum screen size is different than any 
        other mode.  If you wish for a  self explanatory status bar choose 
        any level other than the maximum visual display.
 
 4.  Retrieve Mission
 This will allow you to play previously saved games.
 
 5.  Store Mission
 This will allow you to save up to ten titled games.  Select a slot and press 
 the ENTER key.  Type in a file name and press ENTER.
 
 NOTE:  An auto save feature has been included.  This will automatically 
        save the last level completed and allow you to begin at the new
        floor in the elevator

 or Major levels of difficulty.
 
 
 Game Play
 
 
 The following numbered items will provide you with a description of how to 
 use the information on your display.
 
 1.  HEALTH LEVEL INDICATOR
 This line informs you of your remaining health.  When it is close to zero, 
 locate some medic kits or health chambers to boost you back to normal.  
 Like actual life, you are only given one chance with no repeats . . . 
 watch this status line!
 
 2.  ARMOR STRENGTH RATING
 This line denotes whether or not your character is wearing any type of 
 armor to aid you in your fight.  Armor will not keep you from taking damage.
 Instead, any damage taken is divided up between the armor and your health. 
 
 3.  AMMO REMAINING
 This bar will display the amount of ammo remaining in your human weapons, in 
 terms of rounds.  The alien weapons use energy and will deplete accordingly 
 in terms of percentage.  When the percentage is at zero only an alien charge 
 pack will enable it again. Only 200 rounds can be carried at a time without 
 any aid from the extra items.
 
 4.  PROXIMITY MINES OBTAINED
 You may place a mine in front of you by pressing the M key.  They can
 easily kill any man and most of the aliens.  Place these as traps to
 cover your back when proceeding into a level and if you're lucky they 
 will take out more than one alien.
 
 5.  VISOR ENERGY REMAINING
 Your helmet contains a visor with three different settings.  To 
 activate the settings use the ENTER key.  Each time it is pressed it will
 switch into one of three different modes:
 
 1.  Normal Vision - This will take up  no energy and should be used 
     throughout most of the game.
 
 2.  Night Vision -This will turn the surroundings into a bright green color.  
     This mode is good to see down long corridors in which the normal setting
     will not help.  While this setting is on, your energy level will deplete.
 
 3.  Infrared Vision - This mode will detect heat sources.  There are various 
     laser beams throughout the base that can only be detected in this mode.  
     They will inflict a small amount of damage if not avoided.  Also, some 
     aliens are invisible and can only be seen in this mode by the heat they 
     produce.  Use your energy wisely, you might need it later. 
 
  Your visor energy level will deplete whenever you are in modes two or 
  three. You may replenish the energy with a visor battery located
  throughout the base.
 
 6.  PASS CARDS OBTAINED
 This will show whether or not you have the red or the blue pass cards.  
 On each level there are computers that can be accessed to obtain a security 
 clearance.  Once you are given this color clearance, the card will open up 
 the corresponding colored doors for that level only.  Most clearance codes 
 can be obtained within the security rooms. 
 
 NOTE:  The blue grid-like powered doors, leading to the security rooms, 
        do not require a key to open.
 
 7.  WEAPON IN HAND
 This shows the current weapon that is ready to fire.  In the beginning you 
 are given the standard issue Taser, shotgun and a M-24 C.A.W 
 (Close Assault Weapon) with 100 rounds of ammunition.  As you progress there 
 are more weapons to obtain.  To change weapons, type in the appropriate 
 number from 1 to 8.  Press the CTRL key to fire and hold it down for 
 automatic fire.
 
 8.  ALIENS REMAINING
 This display is the number of aliens left on the current floor.  Securing 
 the floor for the different  difficulty levels requires kills of certain 
 percentages (according to the beginning amount) as follows:
 
 Difficulty          Kills Required
 Corporal                 10%
 Lieutenant               75%
 Captain & Higher         100%
 
 9.  FLOOR LEVEL
 This is the floor you are currently on.  Proceed to the 30th level, locate 
 Corridor 7 and walk through the alien object.  You must then enter the alien 
 world, fight to 40th level and destroy the vortex.
 
 10.  SCORE
 This is your score display which changes for every alien you kill. Any 
 secret passage you locate will be added to your score at the end of each
 level as a bonus.  There are five bonus levels within the first thrity 
 floors that can also add to your total score.
 
 11.  PROXIMITY MAP
 If the TAB key is pressed, an area map will be displayed for a limited range 
 only.  When you pick up the floor map icon, (located on every level) the 
 entire map will be given.  The following colors are represented:
 
 BLUE - Your character's location.
 YELLOW (flashing) - Displays the moving aliens.  
 RED (flashing) - Proximity mines location
 
 NOTE:  This map is essentially a motion detector.  It will only show the 
 aliens that are moving.  Be careful, some aliens can disguise themselves as 
 ordinary objects.  Hidden sections are not shown as well (for security 
 reasons).

 MILITARY WEAPONS
 
 Taser              (Number 1 Key)
 This is a standard sidearm for all security specialists. It is capable of 
 stunning an opponent and can be deadly.  It has unlimited energy but a slow 
 rate of fire.  
 
 Assault Shotgun (Number 2 Key)
 This is the standard shotgun used for the last hundred years.  It uses 
 advanded armor piercing, criostate rounds that inflict tremendous amounts 
 of damage at close range.
 
 M-24 Close Assault Weapon  (Number 3 Key)
 Also known as the M-24 C.A.W, it can hold 200 rounds and can fire in full 
 automatic mode by holding down the CTRL key or the Left Mouse button.  This 
 is your main weapon, available at the beginning.
 
 M-343 Tribarrel Power Blaster  (Number 4 Key)
 This weapon is still under development, but available for use inside Delta 
 Base.  It fires 2 CM phosphorus slugs which cause tremendous amounts of 
 damage.
   
 Proximity Mines (M Key)
 These can be found within the base and cause vast amounts of damage.  
 Anything that passes near them will be destroyed or severely damaged.
 
 
 ALIEN WEAPONS
 
 The weapons listed below are left behind by some of the aliens.  They only 
 use energy packs, which can also be picked up. They will inflict much more 
 damage than the human weapons.
 
 Dual Blaster  (Number 5 Key)
 This alien weapon is small for the damage it can inflict.  Use this weapon 
 to even the odds when outnumbered.
 
 Plasma Rifle  (Number 6 Key)
 This is the top of the line alien weapon.  The rate of fire is slower than 
 the Dual Blaster, but it inflicts more damage.
 
 Alien Assault Cannon  (Number 7 Key)
 This weapon is an improved Dual Blaster.  It fires faster and inflicts more 
 damage than the first alien weapon.
 
 Alien Disintegrator  (Number 8 Key)
 This weapon will eliminate most live objects within its path.  It uses up a 
 large portion of your energy, but it will pull you out of a tight situation.
 
 Each time an alien weapon is fired, the energy level will drain  50%, then it 
 will slowly recharge.  To avoid full energy drain, fire in short bursts and 
 allow time for a recharge.

 The following is a list of solutions to minor problems that might occur when 
 trying to run Corridor 7.
 
 PROBLEM:              I've typed in CORR7CD and it will not run or start.
 
 SOLUTION:             You may not have enough free conventional memory. 
                       Run the chkdsk command in dos and make sure the 
                       'bytes free' is at least 590,000.  If it is not, 
                       make a floppy boot disk and try again (refer to your 
                       dos manual for this procedure).
 
 Or: You tried to run the program through the DOS icon in WINDOWS.  
     This program was not designed to run through windows in any way.
 
 OR: You may need to increase your files to 40 (located in your CONFIG.SYS) 
     to allow for the save game slots.
 
 PROBLEM:               I cannot adjust the screen size to the full setting.
 
 SOLUTION:              You do not have enough conventional memory free to 
                        support the full screen size. Eliminate any TSR 
                        programs or create a DOS boot disk. 
 
 PROBLEM:               The sounds are distorted or irregular.
 
 SOLUTION:              Type in the following command to start the game 
                        instead of RUN : CORR7CD_NOEMS_NOXMS (The _ signifies 
                        a space)
