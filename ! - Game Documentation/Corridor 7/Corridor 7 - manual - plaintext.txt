INTRODUCTION

	Earth's fighting days were believed to be over. Most of America's military funds were being directed toward research and space exploration. In 2012, Dr. Donald Fox, a U.S. exobiologist on one of the 
first manned missions to Mars, returned with a metallic object taken from an area near one of Mars' curious, face-like formations. Scientists were elated, but the government, ever so cautions, 
removed the artifact to an underground research facility called Delta Base. Delta Base, a small weapons development and research center located in the Nevada desert, is the only facility of its kind 
able to test such an object. The object was taken to the lowest level, a maze-likeseries of hallways and test chambers, to the laboratory known as Corridor 7.

	The age of the object was impossible to determine. Most scientists believed it to be ancient, but it showed no traces of its age and its surface could not be sampled even at the molecular level. The 
standard battery of tests were issued. In the back of the chamber the object was subjected to varying levels and types of radiating. During the Gamma phase of testing, the object began to change.

The Invasion Begins....

	Most of the lab in Corridor 7 was destroyed. The object changed and grew in size as personel in the upper levels watched their monitors in astonishment. It began to resemble a ball of lightning.

	The base was put on alert. The obnect seemed to power itself, and no one knew how to shut it down. Nor did they have the time. From inside the object something emerged.. short, humanoid in form, but 
clearly not human.. and carrying what was unmistakably a weapon in one of its arms.

	Alien invaders rushed through the object's opening and seized the base. The artifact was a trap planted thousands of years earlier by the aliens to infor them of presence of advanced races. They 
launched the objects in small foldspace cruisers programmed to seek hospitable solar systems, and in Earth's case, the gate device was planted on Mars. When Earh's fledging culture reached the 
spacefaring stage, discovery was inevitable.

	The aliens wiped out the base personnel. Currently, alien technicians are almost finished installing a device that creates an impenetrable shield around the base, allowing them time to move in more 
troops, assess the environment, and change it to their needs. While Earth has developed some advanced weapons, they pale next to the aliens' technology. Conquest looms ahead. They wil destroy and 
enslave the populace and plunder our resources.

Your Mission

	Headquarters does not realize what happened inside the base. You are an experienced special forces marine given immediate orders to enter the research facility, proceed to the 30th floor, to 
Corridor 7, assess the situation and regain communication with the outside world.

	After a brief helicopter trip, you're face-to-face with Delta Base. Communicating with HQ, you are informed that a large energy force has been detected underground, too large to be man mage. Just 
then, your communications are cut as a blue haze surrounds the facility. The air becomes thich and your lungs feel the pressure. Your only option is to enter the base, preceed to the last level, and 
destroy the object.

Against the Odds

	Several factors are working in your favor. First, you have the element of surprise: they don't know you're there. Second, they believe they've killed everyone and are now budy modifying the base to 
suit their needs. They have posted sentries around the uper levels as safeguards against any possible survivors, so they are not worried about someone as outnumbered and insignificant as yourself. 
They further you descend, more signs of alien habitation are present; walls have been modified to resemble the alien's home environment; aliens weapons and munitions are also present.

	While the aliens vary in size, shape and color, they all have one element in common; they are geared for war. Some aliens may look deceiving, but they are armed with weapons beyond out capabilities, 
moving with speed and in numbers. To add to the tension, some aliens are invisible. Only your infrared vision goggles can aid you in their detection. If you are smart, you will learn their habits, 
adapt and overcome their strengths. Out-gunned and alone, can you survive the slaughter and repel the aliens with only pure courage? Your life is on the line as the Country fears what they do not 
know. Only you can decide out fate. Good luck..


MAIN MENU

1. NEW MISSION
This selection will allow you to begin a new game. Select the level of difficulty on this screen by the appropriate rank:

Corporal
This is the easiest level. It contains the fewest aliens, body armor, and a full map. Recommended for first-time gamers.

Second Lieutenant
This level is a little more challenging. There is no body armor but a map will be given. Recommended for non-arcade players.

Captain
This is the best level of play. The map will only show a partial view until the floor map is found. This level will pose a challenge to most gamers.

Major
This is the toughest level, recommended for those with patience and a desire to succeed against the odds. It will contain the most number of aliens and they will be harder to kill. We are not liable for 
any mental or physical problems that arise from playing this level.

2. Adjust Audio/Visual
This selection will allow you to adjust your sound card volume and your visual display. The following changes are possible:

	SCREEN SIZE: The largest screen will give you the best visual effects. For slower machines reduce the screen for a faster response.

You will start the game in front of the Delta Base entrance. Follow the steps below to proceed.

MOVEMENT		- Use the appropriate ARROW keys. The RIGHT MOUSE button will move you forward.

RUN			- Hold down the RIGHT SHIFT key with the UP ARROW key.

SLIDE			- Hold the ALT key and the LEFT or RIGHT ARROW key.

USE WEAPON		- Choose the appropriate Numeric key:
				1. 	Taser
				2. 	M-24 CAW
				3.	M-343 Tribarrel Powerblaster
				4.	Alien Dual Blaster
				5.	Plasma Rifle

FIRE WEAPON		- Press the CTRL key or the LEFT MOUSE button for a shot or hold it down for a burst.

OPEN DOORS/		- Press the SPACE BAR to open a door. If the door has a red or blue strip above it, the corresponding access card color will be needed to open it.
SECRET DOORS

ELEVATOR		- An elevator will allow you to go to the next level when the floor is secured. The Alien counter must be at zero if you are playing the Captain or 			 Major levels of difficulty.

The screen shot above shows a typical scene within the depths of Delta Base. The following numbered items will provide you with a description of how to use the information on your display.

1. HEALTH LEVEL INDICATOR
This line informs you of your remaining health. When it is close to zero, locate some medic kits or health chambers to boost you back to normal. Like actual life, you are only given one chance with no 
repeats... watch this status bar!

2. ARMOR STRENGTH RATING
This line denotes whether or not your character is wearing any type of armor to aid you in your fight. Armor will not keep you from taking damage. Instead, any damage taken is divided up between the 
armor and your health. The aliens are using some power energy weapons (for which the armor was not designed) so it will only reduce the damage, not protect you fully.

3. AMMO REMAINING
This bar will display the amount of ammo remaining in you M-24 or M-343 in terms of rounds. The alien weapons use energy and will deplete accordingly in terms of a percentage. When the percentage is at 
zero only an alien charge pack will enable it again. Only 200 rounds can be carried at a time without aid from the extra items.

4. PROXIMITY MINES
You may place a mine in front of you by pressing the M key. They can easily kill any man and most of the aliens. Place these as traps to cover your back when proceeding into a level and if you're lucky 
they will take out more than one alien.

5. VISOR ENERGY REMAINING
Your helmet contains a visor with three different settings. To activate the settings use the ENTER key. Each time it is pressed it will switch into one of three different modes:
	
	1. Normal Vision - This will take up no energy and should be used throughout most of the game.
	
	2. Night Vision - This will turn the surroundings into a bright green color. This mode is good to see down long corridors in which the normal setting will not help. 	While this setting is on, your 
energy level will deplete.


	3. Infrared Vision - This mode will detect heat sources. There are various laser beams throughout the base that can only be detected in this mode. They will inflict a 	small amount of damage if not 
avoided. Also, some aliens are invisible and can only be seen in this mode by the heat they produce. Use your energy wisely. You 	might need it later.

Your visor energy level will deplete whenever you are in modes two or three. You may replenish the energy with visor batteries located throughout the base.

6. PASS CARDS
This will show whether or not you have the red or the blue pass cards. On each level there are computers that can be accessed to obtain a security clearance. Once you are given this color clearance, the 
card will open up the corresponding colored doors for that level only. Most clearance codes can be obtained within the security rooms.

7. WEAPON IN HAND
This shows the current weapon that is ready to fire. In the beginning you are given the standard issue Taser and a M-24 C.A.W (Close Assault Weapon) with 100 rounds of ammunition. As you progress there 
are more weapons to obtain. To change weapons, type in the appropriate number from 1 to 5. Press the CTRL key to fire and hold it down for automatic fire.

8. ALIENS REMAINING
This displays the number of aliens left on the current floor. All aliens must be eliminated to secure the floor and proceed to the next level (only if you are playing captain or major levels).

9. FLOOR LEVEL
This is the floor you are currently on. Proceed to the 30th level, locate Corridor 7 and destroy the alien object to close the gate and end the invasion.

10. SCORE
This is your score display which changes for every alien you kill. Any secret passages you locate will be added to your score at the end of each level as a bonus.

11. PROXIMITY MAP
If the TAB key is pressed, an area map will be displayed for a limited range only. When you pick up a flor map icon, the entire map will be given. The following Colors are represented:
	
	LIGHT BLUE - Your character's location
	YELLOW (flashing) - Displays the moving aliens.
	BLUE (flashing) - Proximity mine's location.

A floor map icon is located on every level.

NOTE: This map is essentially a motion detector. It will only show the aliens that are moving. Be careful, some aliens can disguise themselves as ordinary objects. Hidden sections are not shown as well 
(for security reasons).

THE FOLLOWING PAGES WILL GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TO YOU AND THE ALIENS THAT WILL BE ENCOUNTERED WITHING DELTA BASE.



MILITARY WEAPONS

The following weapons can be used within the depths of Delta Base by selecting the appropriate key.

Taser
Use the NUMBER 1 key to select this weapon. This is a standard sidearm for all security specialists. It is capable of stunning an opponent and can be deadly. It has unlimited energy but a slow rate of 
fire.

M-24 Close Assault Weapon (C.A.W.)
This weapon is standard for close combat purposes and is activated by pressing the NUMBER 2 key. It fires 7mm explosive tipped, caseless rounds that will eliminate any opponent. It can hold 200 rounds 
and can fire in full automatic mode by holding down the CTRL key or the LEFT mouse button. This is your best weapon available at the beginning of the game.

M-343 Tribarrel Power Blaster
This weapon is still under development, but available for use when found by pressing the NUMBER 3 key. If fires 2 CM phosphorus slugs which cause tremendous amounts of damage.

Proximity Mines
These can be found within the base and cause vast amounts of damage. Press the M key to drop and activate a mine. Anything that passes near it will be destroyed or severly damaged.


ALIEN WEAPONS

The weapons listed below are left behind by some of the aliens. They only use energy packs, which can also be picked up. They will inflict much more damage than the human weapons.

Dual Blaster
This alien weapon is small for the damage it can inflict. Use the NUMBER 4 key to activate it.

Plasma Rifle
This is the top of the line alien weapon. Once found, you may select it by pressing the NUMBER 5 key. The rate of fire is slower than the Dual Blaster, but it inflicts more damage.

Each time an alien weapon is fired, the energy level will drain 50%, then it will slowly recharge. To avoid full energy drain, fire in short bursts. Two points of energy will dissipate after each press 
of the CTRL key or Left mouse button.

ALIEN INTRUDERS

AILOPROBE
THIS IS THE ALIEN'S STANDARD SENTRY. ITS MAIN PURPOSE IS TO INFORM OTHERS OF AN INTRUDER'S PRESENCE. THEY ARE RATHER WEAK BUT ATTACK IN FORCE.

RODEX
THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE PURE HAVOC. THEY STAY IN PACKS AND ATTACK WITH SPEED. THEY CARRY SMALL WEAPONS SO THEY SHOULD NOT POSE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM.

ENIRAM
THIS CREATURE IS ONLY VISIBLE WHEN IT IS FIRING ITS WEAPON. THEY GENERALLY USE THEIR CLOAKING ABILITY TO SURPRISE THEIR PREY. ONLY THE INFRARED VISION OR THE PROXIMITY MAP WILL REVEAL THEIR PRESENCE.


TROUBLE SHOOTING

The following is a list of solutions to standard problems that might occur when trying to run Corridor 7.

PROBLEM:	I've typed in RUN and it will not run or start correctly.

SOLUTION:	You may not have enough free conventional memory. Run the CHKDSK command in DOS and make sure the 'BYTES FREE' is at least 590,000. If it is not, make a floppy 		boot disk and try 
again (refer to you DOS manual for this procedure).

OR:		You tried to run the program through the DOS icon in WINDOWS. This program was not designed to run through WINDOWS.

PROBLEM:	I cannot adjust the screen size to the full setting.

SOLUTION:	You do not have enough conventional memory free to support the full screen size. Eliminate any TSR programs and re-boot the machine or create a DOS boot disk (refer 		to your DOS manual).

PROBLEM:	Game freezes after the initial screen.

SOLUTION:	Are you using DOS 6.X with the Double Spacing feature (or any other program that compresses space)? This program cannot be compressed. Please put this game in 		the uncompressed portion 
of your hard drive.

PROBLEM:	I have a sound card and the game sounds are distorted.

SOLUTION:	The digitized sound effects will often be cut off mid-play if there is any type of interrupt conflict. The original default for Soundblaster cards was INT 7. The optimum 		performance is 
achieved at this setting. If using the Soundblaster emulation of a Pro-Audio Spectrum card, make sure that the Pro-Audio Spectrum and Soundblaster 		interrupts are different.

If you get an error you do not understand and cannot solve, please write down the exact error and contact our Customer Service Department, Monday through Friday, between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., Eastern 
Standard Time. Before you do, please make sure you're near your computer and that it's up and running.
