To view the exciting Blake Stone screen previews, just type 'BLAKE'.  By
running the viewer, you'll be able to get a glimpse of one of the most amazing
shareware games yet released.

Shareware's newest game design stars, JAM PRODUCTIONS, have released an
unbelievable action game, "BLAKE STONE: Aliens Of Gold" by the shareware game
giant, Apogee Software.

In this futuristic game, you play the part of British agent, Blake Stone.  The
overall story pits you against the intelligent but demented Dr. GoldFire, his
henchmen, and his evil genetic experiments.  Luckily, British intelligence has
scientist-informants to help you out on your quest to stop GoldFire's evil
plans.

You're first mission is to secretly explore one of Dr. GoldFire's "Space
Technology And Research" (STAR) buildings -- namely, the earth-based STAR
Institute.  Strange things have been reported there--something about genetic,
alien research.  British intelligence doesn't know much about what goes on
inside the STAR Institute, it's your job is to find out!

The Aliens Of Gold game design features include:

þ RE-ENTRYABLE LEVELS:  Each mission takes place in a multi-story building of
  at least ten different floors.  These floors may be traversed in any order
  and may be re-entered at any time.  For example, some floors contain
  materials needed on floors you may have already partly explored.  This makes
  for a multitude of different ways in which each mission could be played.
  This 're-entry' technique turns what would normally be ten individual levels
  into ONE HUGE LEVEL!

þ SMART ACTORS:  Smart actors will look at their surroundings, 'think' about
  the situation, and act accordingly.  For instance, when a scientist runs out
  of ammo, he'll look around and pick more up if it's available (possibly
  before YOU can reach it!).  If none can be found, he'll look for a door and
  try to run out of the room before you can shoot him.  Smart actors perform a
  similar action when their health is low.  Smart actors make game play more
  exciting because both YOU and THEY are fighting for health and the same ammo!

þ INTERACTIVE ACTORS:  In general, the scientists are 'nice guys'; that is,
  they don't start out as your adversaries.  They quietly roam around the
  buildings doing their jobs.  It's your decision whether or not to interrogate
  a scientist.  If he's an informant, you get a clue or his ammo.  Then again,
  you might get a stomach full of lead!  Scientists will also start shooting
  when they sense something is wrong; say, a dead body on the floor or another
  actor shooting.

þ INTERACTIVE OBJECTS:  Specific wall sections are designed for interacting
  with the player.  (These are new to Blake Stone, are have no parallels in
  Wolfenstein 3-D.)

þ CONCESSION MACHINES are used to get food, drinks, or a clue.  The food and
  drinks will increase the player's health.

þ ELEVATOR BUTTONS:  A panel is used to move around the different floors in
  each building.  Simply select a number and you're on your way; that is,
  unless the floor is locked.  Locked floors require a code to be entered
  first.  But, surely some nice scientist (informant) could help you out with
  these codes.

þ PLASMA BARRIERS:  These electronic gates are controlled by switches located
  throughout each complex.  Switches can be connected to plasma barriers
  located on the same floor or on a different floor.  You must be careful when
  moving around ACTIVE plasma barriers because their powerful forces will harm
  you when touched.

þ ENHANCED ACTOR ANIMATIONS:  Many actors were created with extensive animated
  frames.  Some of these creatures include:

 -- Mutants that rise from gurneys for their ensuing chase!
 -- POD aliens that break out of their indestructible pods! 
 -- Electro-Aliens that emerge from wall-mounted sockets!
 -- Liquid aliens that flow toward you, then rise to attack!
 -- Contained creatures that burst out from locked canisters!
 -- ...and a lot MORE!

(Plus all actors have must-see death cinematics.)

þ OTHER COOL STUFF:  Many other things have been added to make game
  play exciting, fun, and just plain different! Some of these
  include:

 -- Crates can be blown apart to reveal weapons and other goodies!
 -- One-way doors (once you go in, you must find another way out!)
 -- Direct Level Transport (DLT) warps you to secret levels!
 -- Electrically-linked doors (multiple doors open at once!)
 -- VMT units that explode when shot (chain reaction explosions!)
 -- Lots of goodies (gold, money bags, food, ammo, etc.)
 -- Over 16 unique actors (guards, aliens, mutants, pods, etc!)
 -- Internal scenarios (hi-tech buildings, space station, moonbase)
 -- Five futuristic weapons (with silent-shot and grenades!)
 -- AdLib/SB support (FM and digitized sound effects!  [IN STEREO])
 -- Over 15 musical scores (action-oriented -- never dull!)
 -- Animated, musical, text presentation system
 -- 60 PRIMARY levels PLUS secret levels!
 -- Over 3.5 MB of high-speed 256-color animated VGA graphics!
 -- ...and much, MUCH MORE!

As if that's not enough, even *MORE* features have been added for version 2.0!

þ IMPROVED AUTOMAPPER: One of Blake Stone's strengths is it's internal
  automapper.  You will no longer get lost in those difficult mazes like you
  did in Wolfenstein 3D.  In this new version, the automapper will rotate so
  that it's always facing the same way you are.  Version 1.0 of Blake Stone
  had an automapper as well, but it was always "Face North", which means the
  map was static.  This new one will give you a much different and improved
  mapping feature.

þ BETTER 3D EFFECT: New to version 2.0 of Blake Stone is a better 3D effect.
  This is accomplished by the use of what is commonly called light sourcing.
  (It's also called light diminishing or luminescence.)  This means that things
  further away from you are darker than things in front of you.  This makes for
  a much more realistic feel to the game!

þ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  This game requires the following MINIMUM
  system configuration:

 -- 25 Mhz 386SX
 -- DOS 5.0+
 -- 8 MB of hard drive space
 -- VGA graphics card
 -- Optional: Mouse, Joystick, AdLib Sound Card (for music), SoundBlaster
              or 100% compatible for heart pounding digitized effects!
