Here is a listing of all the Apogee games to date.    The first section
is the games that are in wide distribution.   This list is current as
of Friday, March 26, 1993.   I will also list the current filename as
available from Apogee Software and the Software Creations BBS (Apogee's
Home BBS at 1-508-365-2359).   I'm looking into getting a regular FTP
site for Apogee Software.   For now it's kind of scattered.  If you
have any information on where our stuff is for FTP, please E-Mail me
and let me know.

Section IV - Not Widely Available Games
---------------------------------------
All the games in this section are available, but they have to be
written in for.  The reason for this is because some of our older
games are processed differently.  The orders for the older games
are done by hand, and not via the normal method.  This is why we
don't take phone orders on the older games.   The other reason
these games aren't widely available is that they are our first
games, and to be quite honest, they don't match up to the quality
of the games in Section One.   If you wanted the shareware for
these games, you'd have to write to Apogee and ask for it.  The
shareware for any of these games (and for ALL of our games is
available for $4 apiece).

The Thor Trilogy (3 games)         -> Similar to Kroz
SuperNova (1 game)                 -> Text Adventure
Beyond the Titantic (1 game)       -> Text Adventure
Word Whiz (4 games)                -> Word definition Quiz
Trivia Whiz (5 games)              -> Trivia Quiz

SECTION V - Discontinued Games
------------------------------
These games have been permanantely discontinued.   They are
no longer available from Apogee under any condition.   If you
see these games, please remove them.

Star Trek Trivia ->  Paramount told us not to sell this
Star Trek:TNG Trivia -> Same reason
Jumpman Lives! -> Sold rights to another company
