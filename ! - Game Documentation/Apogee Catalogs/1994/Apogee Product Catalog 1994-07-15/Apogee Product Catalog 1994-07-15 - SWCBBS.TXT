ORDER APOGEE GAMES ONLINE
=========================
This service should be up and running by October 1994.  It will allow players
to download the full/registered versions of any Apogee game by using a credit
card for payment.  Not only will you get your game right away, but you'll save
on shipping charges!  (Plus, Apogee will still mail you the game manual and a
catalog, which you'll get a few days later.)  Just another reason why Apogee
and Software Creations are #1.

THE FREE APOGEE FILE SECTION
============================
The Software Creations BBS is your round-the-clock source for new Apogee
shareware releases.  Log on and check out the "Apogee" file section, which
is file directory #1, of course.  All shareware game downloads are free!


LOCAL ACCESS SAVES YOU ON LONG-DISTANCE COSTS
=============================================
SprintNet local access lines now available!

Joining up with the #1 X.25 provider in the world, Software Creations has
made our system locally available to more than 1000 cities world-wide. If
you pay more than 6.5 cents per minute to the phone company, you're paying
too much!

How do I sign up?  In order to access us via Sprint's local access network,
Software Creations must create an account for you.  We will need your name,
address, phone number, and credit card information.

There are three methods of applying for access.  We have an online ordering
door set up to accept credit card purchases; simply log into Software
Creations and type LOCAL or ACCESS at the main menu.  You can also call our
special 800 number  - (800) 4-SWCBBS - and order a local access kit.

Upon receipt of your order, a starter kit will be mailed to you, which will
contain a step by step procedure on how to access the service and a
shareware copy of deltaComm's TELIX with a pre-written script to log you
into Software Creations.

How much will it cost?  Access from anywhere in the continental United States
will be $3.95 per hour, prepaid by time units.  (Time units are sold by the
hour.)


THE APOGEE AND SWC PARTNERSHIP -- IT'S ALL FOR YOU!
===================================================
Apogee and Software Creations have joined forces to bring you the best online
gaming experiences.  Look for big announcements regarding future developments
and special online games that will allow several players to combat each other
in a very realistic 3D world!  The action should start by mid-1995.

To become part of the official Apogee BBS Distribution Network (already over
3000 BBS's strong) please download the file APG_DIST.ZIP from Directory #2.

The Software Creations BBS was recently voted the #1 most popular BBS in the
world by the readers of Boardwatch Magazine, and featured on Prime Time Live.
