To use this patch for Wolfenstein 3-D, you must copy the two files
(MAPHEAD.WL? and GAMEMAPS.WL?) to your current Wolfenstein 3-D
directory.  Doing this will erase the current equivalent files,
but that's exactly what you want to do.

This patch will allow you to access the secret level from the first
episode (first level) of the game.

Thank you.  If you want to get the full version shareware version
that has this fix, look for file name #1WOLF12.ZIP.

Thank you,
Apogee Software
