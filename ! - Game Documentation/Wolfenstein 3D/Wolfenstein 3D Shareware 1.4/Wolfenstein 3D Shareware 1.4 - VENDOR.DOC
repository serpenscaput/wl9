Dear Vendor,

First, everyone at Id Software would like to thank you for
distributing our product.

Adrian Carmack: "Thank you" 
John Carmack: "Thank you"
Kevin Cloud: "Thank you"
Tom Hall: "Thank you"
John Romero: "Thank you"
Jay Wilbur: "Thank you"

Second, in order to make your life easier we are providing our
games in a format that is easy for you to divide amongst several
disks and still be easy for the user to install.  You may use
disks of any size!  To do this simply copy the files,
"INSTALL.BAT, DEICE.EXE, FILE_ID.DIZ, DESC.SDI, *.DAT & VENDOR.DOC
onto disk one along with the file *.1.  After that all you have
to do is move the files *.2, *.3....*.n onto their own disks.

We've broken the *.n files down into 360k chunks so you can
easily distribute them on 360k disks.  If you are using larger
capacity disks simply put as many *.n files as will fit on each
disk.  You wouldn't want to charge people for unused space when
all you had to do was copy another *.n file onto a disk already
being used?  At least you wouldn't want us to find out about it!

Again thanks for helping us get the game into the hands of those
who will enjoy playing it!

Jay Wilbur, Id Software
