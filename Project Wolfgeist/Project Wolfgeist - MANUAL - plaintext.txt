PART ONE – CASTLE HALLS

Levels 1-2 – Entrances. Here, you must enter the castle.

Levels 3-8 – Heimzum Part. Most of the castle is here. The castle is split into units 
with names, this one is called Heimzum.

Levels 9-10 – Outer Castle. Is not so ”castly”, but has a boss called Schwarzsicht. 
You start in the storage, where many officers are.

Levels 11-18 – Färmmler Part. This part of the castle was until 1937 housed by Schabbs 
mutants. So watch out! His old inventions might still be there. But, since 1934, 
no one has inhabited in here. So it’s a bit ”oldish”. The normal guards appear plentiful, 
because most are dead or did take their own life because of loneliness. In 10 years, 
they haven’t seen another human being though. 

Levels 19-26 Überwäschen Part. A strange part, split up a little. The first two levels 
are Wooden Bunker Halls, the 20th floor is guarded by boss Mehrerphrutenpehlingeghurer. 
Level 21 is the ”Mysterious floor”, because in 1939, after you won floor 1 of Castle 
Wolfenstein, the floor was transported by Huge Airplanes. In level 21, you must break 
it again. Though, a little abandoned.
Levels 22-23 are an archeological place, where nazis are starting to inhabit. It’s 
stands back from 1250, it can perhaps be scary. Levels 24-25 are normal bunkers. 


Levels 26-27 – Müliu Part. Are mystic. Level 26 is a big steelhall with mutants. 
Level 27 is…a lair of some kind. Much stuff blended together, nearly unguarded!

Levels 28-30 – Pottsweig Part. Guarded by the known minister Goering.

PART TWO – THE LABS

Level 31 – Medicine Hall. Not the biggest. Just locate the exit, and the labs are 
in front of you! 

Levels 32-34 – Mutation Hall. Here the mutants are going to come alive.

Levels 35-36 – Leakes. Here you will meet the dead body of Barnacle Wilhelm who you 
killed when you got the spear. He is now resurrected, and has a new look. He has 
an SS-beret, and his missile launcher and chaingun. Though, there are no more bullets 
in his chaingun! In the next level you will face the so-called ”Failed Hitler Experiment”.


Level 37 – Travelling back to an old place, where you must get out.

13 – Former Hitler’s Lastout
15 – A huge Library
16 – A long corridor, guarded by mutants
18 – Steel Hall, since 1897 the electric system of the castle. Not inhabited since 
1937.
27 – Smash down. WTF is that???
34 – Perhaps the shortest level. But difficult 
