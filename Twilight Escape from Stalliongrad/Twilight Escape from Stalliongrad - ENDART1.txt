Finally, you have taken down Starlight Glimmer with your Gattling Gun! Or is it? 
You've witnessed her teleporting out of her lair.
 
You exit the Dungeon halls, free the Equalized and your friends. Later, you gathered

where Starlight used to lock away the ponies' Cutie Marks,
unlocked them and gave the ponies back their Cutie Marks. You and your friends hang 
out at the once 'Stalliongrad' fortress and had a little party then went home, back 
at Ponyville.

Equestria forever...

This is the Calm before the storm...
