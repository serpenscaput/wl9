<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><I>Notes by Parafriction </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">After completing <I>The Final Solution</I>, I
played around with an idea to make the spirit a little higher in the
Wolfenstein Community. I believed it was time for something new, but
I couldn't figure out what. Then my dad gave me the idea to start up
a group project. As I believe now, I'm now the coordinator of the
project. <I>Untergehende Traum</I>, which means <I>Crumbling
Dream</I>, will be a 20-level TC with level and graphics design close
to the original Wolfenstein, be it more realistic. So far there are 9
members:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">THE STORY:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Spring, 1945.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The Nazi war machine, once an all conquering
force sweeping through Europe, is on its knees as the Allied forces
penetrate the German Fatherland.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The Allied High Command, confident that their
current rate of advance through German territory will see Berlin fall
in the coming weeks, prepares to put the plans for their final
assault into action. The sense of urgency, so prevalent in the days
when the Reich had the upper hand, has subsided. Though caution must
be exercised, and all available force utilised, the Allies know
victory is at hand.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Or is it?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="Images/spear02.gif" WIDTH=87 HEIGHT=87 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=left>You
are William Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz, terminal action seeker and hero
of the Allied cause. Your exploits during the war are the stuff that
legends are made of. Capturing the "Spear of Destiny", and thereby
denying Hitler a decided psychological advantage when the Reich was
at its peak. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Escaping from Castle Wolfenstein and
eliminating key members of the Nazi hierarchy in the process,
including the maniacal Dr. Schabbs. You'd even assaulted Hitler's own
stronghold, and taken on who you had believed was Adolf himself, but
the cunning Fuhrer, resourceful as ever, had substituted a double in
his place. Still, to say you'd put a dent in the Nazi's schemes was
an understatement.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">As the end of the war appears imminent, the
somewhat "relaxed" attitude adopted by many of the Allied hierarchy
has not escaped your attention. Concerned that this matter needs to
be addressed, you have arranged to meet with the top Allied boy
himself, Commander in Chief of Allied Forces, General Henry Lee
Jackson, stationed in a fortified bunker not far from liberated
Paris.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">As you enter the General's office, you snap
to attention and salute. "Ahhh, B.J. Blazkowicz," acknowledges the
General. Pointing to a seat, he adds, "Sit down, my boy, sit down..."
As you take your seat, the General lights a cigar, and, puffing
thoughtfully, asks: "Now B.J., what is it I can do for
you?"</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">"General Jackson," you reply, "I'm concerned
that overconfidence could create a problem in these final weeks. I
was just wanting to seek your assurance that you'd ensure there is
absolutely no let up whatsoever in the aggressiveness of the Allied
attacks until this war is over."</FONT></P>

<CENTER>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="Images/bj2.gif" WIDTH=48 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The General smiled. "Thank you for your
concern, B.J., but rest assured, all is under control". "General",
you replied, "with all due respect, you've only been in command for
just under a month now. It's not like you've been running this
invasion from day one, you know..."</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">An impatient look came over the General's
face. "B.J.", he said, "You needn't concern yourself with this. I can
assure you that, since I took command after General Ridley was
poisoned last month, Allied Command is more alert than
ever".</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">"Well, that's good to hear. Still, with my
experience behind enemy lines, I was thinking that maybe I should
infiltrate Berlin and ascertain what resistance our boys are likely
to encounter".</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">"Do you think we are incompetent?" snapped
the General. "We know the enemy movements, what's left of them,
better than they probably do themselves. No incursion by you will be
of any help at all, B.J., besides, you've already done enough to help
the Allied cause. You'd only be interfering. In other words, I'm
giving you an order, B.J., stay out of it. I can assure you that
victory will be ours!"</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Accepting the General's response, you stand
back to attention, salute, and bid him farewell.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">As you leave the office, General Jackson
stubs out his cigar. "Damn you Blazkowicz," he muttered quietly to
himself. "I wish eliminating you could be as easy as poisoning Ridley
had been". He turned to face the plans on the table opposite. Plans
he'd carefully prepared for the last few weeks since he'd taken
command. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Ahh, yes, the Fuhrer would be pleased. The
Allied armies were walking straight into a beautifully prepared
ambush. General Henry Lee Jackson, a loyal Nazi better known to the
Fuhrer by his birth name of Heinrich J&auml;ger, had worked hard for
the Reich in attaining the position of Commander in Chief of the
Allied Forces. Years of pretending to be loyal to the Allied dogs had
been difficult. But the rewards were not far away.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">"Yes, B.J.," he muttered to himself again, "I
didn't lie to you. Victory WILL be ours. Not yours, but OURS! Heil
Hitler!"</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="Images/BJmad.jpg" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=50 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The General's biggest mistake, though, was
allowing you, B.J. Blazkowicz, to leave. Something just didn't seem
right. You couldn't quite put a finger on it. But you knew you
couldn't sit back and ignore it.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Damn what the General had ordered. You'd made
up your mind. Looks like it was time for B.J. to pay Uncle Adolf a
visit to make sure the Allied armies weren't going to receive a nasty
reception!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">2 Days Later:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Berlin - Hitler's bunker:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The message expected from General "Jackson"
had finally arrived. As a result, following direct orders from the
Fuhrer, German forces positioned themselves strategically around the
Reichstag and surrounding areas to greet the unsuspecting Allied
armies. The ambush they had prepared would be devastating.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The last thing they needed was B.J.
Blazkowicz to come sniffing around...</FONT></P>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="Images/minibj.gif" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=72 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">LEVEL GUIDE:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Level 1 Felsendampf Geheimtunnel</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">When you arrive at an abandoned house near
the Reichstag, you find the entrance to a tunnel leading to the
cellars of the Reichstag. You must enter the eerie, damp, dark tunnel
in order to get inside the cellars of the Reichstag.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Levels 2-3 Reichstag Cellars</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">These cellars are lightly guarded by SS and
Hitlerjugend. Be careful not to get lost in the many
pilestocking-areas. They may seem to be exact the same;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Levels 4-6 Lobby/Main halls</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Via the elevator you get inside the Reichstag
Lobby. Finally a chance to see what's still left of the once
beautiful chapel. Be warned - besides Nazi architecture there are
also various SS, HitlerJugend and Gestapo waiting for you!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Levels 7-10: NSDAP Conference
Floors</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This is the most high-class area of the
Reichstag. On these floors Hitler conferenced with his party, the
NSDAP. It is now a place where the officers hide. These levels have
as common enemies the quick and speedy Gestapo officers, so be warned
to stay covered!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Level 11: Felsendampf Geheimtunnel
2</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Back in the tunnel. Hitler didn't seem to be
in the Reichstag, so it's time to turn in the direction you couldn't
access on forehand: the tunnel part leading to the
F&uuml;hrungbunker. This part of the tunnel is guarded by various SS
and HitlerJugend. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This tunnel seems just like the original
tunnel backwards, but when you get to the part where you couldn't
enter on first hand, it'll get harder and uneasier to follow. After
all, Uncle Adolf doesn't want any unwelcome visitors, does
he?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Level 12: The F&uuml;hrerbunker</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This is it -- Here you'll face the Fuhrer
himself. But before you can get to him, you'll have to navigate
through the bunker, which is guarded by many SS and Gestapo. Be
prepared -- you're in for the fight of your life.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Architectal Notice: This level is made upon
an actual blueprint of the F&uuml;hrerbunker. Believe it or not, it
was made from a blueprint from a book about the Second World War. So
be sure to visit a place that did existed -- all right all right, it
looked different, but the architecture was the same in World War II.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Levels 13-15: Old Reichstag</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This part of the Reichstag was the old
chansellor's conference area. Here, 20 meters below the fundaments of
the Reichstag, the secret conferences between the chansellor and the
generals were held back in World War I. Today it's guarded by a few
of the Allied Forces' "turncoats": deserters now on the Axis'
side.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Level 16: Horst Grosse's Den</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Originally the old chansellor's dressing
room, this dark and eerie place is now ruled by Horst Grosse, close
friend of the Fuhrer and companion of Heinrich J&auml;ger. His domain
is that where you'll find out where Heinrich J&auml;ger is
hiding.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Levels 17-19: Reichstag Upper
Floors</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">These floors will eventually lead you to the
roof, where Heinrich J&auml;ger is waiting for you. Be warned --
These are the most heavy guarded floors of the entire
Reichstag.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Level 20: Reichstag Roof</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">All right now, it's time to salute Mr.
Jackson on the military way -- swapping some lead into his head. Beat
this guy and your mission is complete. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Here's some shots of the current framework
for the game. (don't look at the level numbers, they're just concept
maps). The status bar was designed by Steve Walley (AReyeP). BJ's
sleeves and the Reichswehr-enemy (replaces the Mutant) are drawn by
Parafriction. The rock texture (of level 5) was designed by Eric
Vaughn.</FONT></P>
