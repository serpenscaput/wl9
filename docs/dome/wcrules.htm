Dome Wallpaper Contest </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Rules:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Everyone who wants, creates
his own perfect Wolfenstein or Spear related wallpaper using
screenshots of the game, VGA or VSWAP images, website images,
whatever he can think of. Just do what makes him think that will make
his wallpaper stand out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Everyone can make as many
wallpapers as he likes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Every wall paper should be
800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall. This is because the desktop uses
this size for a perfect view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Wallpapers may not be edited
already sent-in images(for instance, when someone sends in a 'get
psyched' wallpaper, I can't send in the same wallpaper with an id
logo to it. A wallpaper has to be totally different from the others.
That doesn't mean someone may not use graphics from other wallpapers
for their own!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Swastikas in wallpapers are
fine; just don't overload the wallpapers with them. The topic is
Wolfenstein, not Nazism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Every wallpaper will stay
available at the Wolfenstein 3D Dome. Every wallpaper that gets sent
in, will be posted directly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Correspondation about the
results or vote amounts per wallpaper is NOT possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FFFFFF">*Contest will durate 1 month
or until 30 wallpapers are sent in. After that, everyone can mail
through their top 5 of best wall papers to Brian. More details at the
