<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">"Hello, Well, I'm another big fan of Wolf3d.
It's great to see that you liked the player! My initial project was
to convert all the musics to MIDI. In order to fully understand the
structure of the music tracks, I decided to build a music player. So
now I know what every byte-sequence in the tracks mean.
Unfortunately, MIDI conversion is harder to accomplish. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I started writing a converter and managed a
partial translation of a couple of tracks. But I had other real-life
matters to attend to and temporarily abandoned it. Basically, you
have to map Adlib frequencies to notes. It can be done (and I did,
but each track is a separate problem to handle). Then you have to map
'volume' -&gt; MIDI velocity. Again, it can be done, but I stopped
working at that point. And don't forget the 'sound textures',
matching Adlib voices to MIDI instruments; and drum tracks. Even
then, most of the songs have effects like vibrato, slides and such.
And on the MIDI world it is again possible to achieve such effects.
But you need a very intelligent program to successfully detect and
convert stuff like that. And what I have so far is not a real smart
piece of code, just basic translation. Anyway, to do it properly,
human supervision is required. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">What can I say? It is possible to create an
automatic converter, and you would have to manually supervise and
re-arrange every track in order to get something similar to the
original. I have seen four or five Wolf MIDI's out there, some are
perfect translations and I keep wondering where did they come from
(Apogee itself?). But someone has to write such a program.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">If you want to/have some programming
knowledge, I can help you with what I already know. Else... Maybe
sometime in the future I get motivated again and finish the
conversion. Maybe someone else did something similar with other games
and can provide the extra effort. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Why not try contacting the guys at HYPERLINK
</FONT><A HREF="http://www.mixnmojo.com/highland/"><I>http://www.mixnmojo.com/highland/</I></A><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.
They converted lots of Adlib songs from LucasArts games and are
experts on the subject? Then again, maybe they grew tired of doing
so. If they are willing to help and need some info on the track
structure, let them contact me. If all of the above fails, you can
still learn how to program it (I can help you out a bit) and do it
yourself! That's how most utilities get born. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Well? Tell me about it. See you, Martin
Fernandez"</FONT></P>
