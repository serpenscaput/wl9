<P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style" COLOR="#99FF99">Here's the exchange
of emails between Adam and Kenny concerning the deletion of Adam's
site... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Brian, I'm sure you've seen the site
that says I destroyed his site. Well I have something you can make
into a text file and put it on you news page for the explanation why
this guy is full of shit. Anyway here's the message:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Okay this guy named Adam had a wolf site and he
ripped my whole source code section off so I e-mailed him and this is
the e-mail:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"Adam,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I went to your page today and I saw your source
code section. You have some tutorials that I wrote and they are a rip
off of mine that you altered. All you had to do was e-mail me and ask
but you didn't do that. Now since you just took it without asking
take my tutorials off of your page and no don't ask if you can use
them because the answer is no. Be creative and make your own
stuff.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">-Kenny"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Okay he replied with:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The decision was made earlier this morning to
delete my internet site. This was a decision partly due to the email
you sent me and due to a decision of my friends at school. My site
was never meant to be a 'proper' wolfenstein site it was only meant
to be an experiment with my skills on frontpage 98. I only put a bit
of the source code section on my site and I think you should also
tell the other people that steal your tutorials to get them of their
site as well. The whole of the web site should be gone by 12:00am.
You seemed to be a person who wouldn't mind if I used some of your
tutorials, Sorry for any inconvienience and i think you did the right
thing by telling me. I provided a link on my site but maybe that
wasn't enough"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Okay his site is now offline, on the bottom of his
page it said "Kindly ripped from the Wolf3D Mansion" anyways here's
the link to his page:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">He says I destroyed his site. That is a total lie,
I told him to take off my tutorials so this guy does not
know</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What he's talking about.</FONT></P>
