<P>STORY:</P>

<P>With the collapse of the Reich, the German war machine</P>

<P>melted down. Without the strict leadership of the</P>

<P>Fuhrer, chaos slipped into the remains of the Reich.</P>

<P>The randomly selected government, helpless in the face</P>

<P>of events, crumbled rapidly. Anxious to avoid Allied</P>

<P>Superiority, the Wehrmacht stepped in and assumed</P>

<P>power. Under the strict command of the new Fuhrer,</P>

<P>Karl Biberach (called Fettgesicht by his enemies),</P>

<P>order returned to the Reich. The people of Germany,</P>

<P>still haunted by uncertainty, sullenly accepted the</P>

<P>new government without recall.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Karl Biberach, as the new Fuhrer of Germany, began to</P>

<P>re-establish the weapon creation facilities and</P>

<P>started new training programs for SS, SA and</P>

<P>Hitlerjugend. With this swift and amibitous rearmament</P>

<P>program, the Reich was again ready for battle within 3</P>

<P>months.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Thanks to the secret vault of war journals in Berlin,</P>

<P>the plans for the latest German technology during the</P>

<P>war, recovered and advanced weapons came in</P>

<P>production. U-boats with higher speeds and firepower</P>

<P>started patrolling the Atlantic again. Heavy tanks</P>

<P>were sent to France. The war, just after it's seemed</P>

<P>end, has started again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The new Fuhrer now turned attention to Switzerland.</P>

<P>Within 2 days it was taken over, despite the fact that</P>

<P>Switzerland was a neutral country in the war days.</P>

<P>German troops poured to other borderlands as well.</P>

<P>With these grim tidings the Germans had good cards on</P>

<P>their side.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The weapon factories in Bremen and Danzig, the</P>

<P>factories with the highest production rate, were</P>

<P>bombed by the Allies in hopes of stopping the new</P>

<P>Fuhrer. But Biberach, as cunning as Hitler was, simply</P>

<P>opened 3 new factories in Schleswig-Holstein, up in</P>

<P>the high north of Germany. To be more exact, in</P>

<P>Lubeck. Home of an ancient castle by the name of</P>

<P>"Festung Fenderborn". This place was ideal; no</P>

<P>villages, no farms, just mountains everywhere. After 3</P>

<P>months of work, the weapon factory network is done.</P>

<P>Settled around Fenderborn, the factories are under</P>

<P>heavy security.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Allies watched these developments with shock and</P>

<P>surprise. The Reich, shortly ago brought back to a</P>

<P>minor thread, had risen up again. If not acted</P>

<P>quickly, the Allied High Command realised, the war</P>

<P>would take in Europe again. So they decided to send in</P>

<P>their best man. You.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You are William Joseph Blazcowickz, B.J. for friends.</P>

<P>With 24 years the youngest hero of the Allied Cause.</P>

<P>Your exploits during the war are the stuff that</P>

<P>legends are made of. Capturing the "Spear of Destiny", and</P>

<P>thereby denying Hitler a decided psychological advantage</P>

<P>when the Reich was at its peak. Escaping from Castle
Wolfenstein</P>

<P>and eliminating key members of the Nazi hierarchy</P>

<P>in the process, including the maniacal Dr. Schabbs.</P>

<P>You'd even assaulted Hitler's own stronghold and taken on</P>

<P>Adolf himself. To say you'd put a dent in the Nazi's schemes is
an</P>

<P>understatement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Your mission is to infiltrate the network by force,</P>

<P>get rid of any high-ranked officer around and</P>

<P>eventually take the new Fuhrer down. And return</P>

<P>safely, ofcourse. Allied High Command counts on you</P>

<P>B.J. The fate of the world is once again in your</P>

<P>hands. Fight hard out there.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>LEVEL GUIDE:</P>

<P>Levels 1-6 Erdbach facility</P>

<P>The first installation in the Lubeck-Network. This is</P>

<P>a less-guarded facility that creates hand-held weapons</P>

<P>like Lugers and MP 40s. You start at the slimey,</P>

<P>inhabited parts of the installation(which was actually</P>

<P>built on top of a church dating back from 1600). From</P>

<P>here you'll have to enter the main factory silos. On</P>

<P>floor 6 you'll face Franz Helmstedt, general of the SS</P>

<P>and owner of this factory. Be warned, he packs twin</P>

<P>chainguns!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Level 7 Felsendampf Tunnel</P>

<P>This dark and eerie place leads to the Untertau</P>

<P>facility. You'll have to traverse this damp, cold</P>

<P>floor before getting into the cellars of the Untertau</P>

<P>facility.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Levels 8-13 Untertau Facility</P>

<P>With a mere thousand weapons made a month, the</P>

<P>Untertau Facility is the biggest of the 2 facilities.</P>

<P>Besides the fact that it's full of machinery from</P>

<P>bottom to top, it looks more like an high-class office</P>

<P>than a factory. Be warned - besides Nazi architecture</P>

<P>and machinery, there are also various SS, HitlerJugend</P>

<P>and Gestapo waiting for you! On floor 15 you'll meet</P>

<P>Bernd Habermann, Feldwebel of the Gestapo and owner of</P>

<P>the Untertau Facility. This cranky fella totes twin</P>

<P>chainguns, so watch your step!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Levels 14 Dunkelwasser Tunnel</P>

<P>The second tunnel within the network. From here you'll</P>

<P>enter the cellars of Festung Fenderborn.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Levels 15-20: Festung Fenderborn</P>

<P>The final destination of your journey. This fortress</P>

<P>with mostly underground areas is the headquarters of</P>

<P>the new Fuhrer, Fettgesicht(Karl Biberach). Be careful</P>

<P>in here, as it's the most heavily guarded fortress in</P>

<P>Germany. On floor 20 you'll meet Biberach in person.</P>

<P>He packs a punch plus a rocket launcher. Be careful!</P>
