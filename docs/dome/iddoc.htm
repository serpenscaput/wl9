<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">I just received the
following letter from Todd Hollenshead, CEO of Id
Software:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Nayt, </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Your site at:
http://wolf3d.gamehosts.com/bw/index2.shtml and the games entitled
"Beyond Wolfenstein" and "Beyond Wolfenstein 2" that are distributed
from it are real problems from a copyright and trademark standpoint.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">You need to cease
distribution of all id content from your site immediately unless you
have a specific license for redistribution of such material. You also
need to inform other sites which "mirror" your files section to
remove the files and cease future downloads as soon as possible.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">I understand that
you're a fan of the games, which is really the only reason you're not
getting a real nasty letter from me or our lawyers right now. I think
you must be confused as to what is permitted with respect to
distribution of our property and specifically the Wolf 3D engine.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Succinctly, we have
publicly released the *source code* to Wolfenstein 3D. We have not
released any of the art or other game media. Redistribution of such
media is copyright infringement. Using the "ID" logo and "Wolfenstein
3D", both of which are registered trademarks, with such
redistribution constitutes trademark infringement. The sounds that
you are distributing also most likely infringe on the copyrights of
Bobby Prince, the creator and owner of such sounds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">These are all very
serious issues which can't be over looked just because you aren't
charging for the game or didn't intend anyone harm, etc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Please contact me via
return email immediately and confirm that you will immediately cease
distribution of "Beyond Wolfenstein", "Beyond Wolfenstein 2", and any
other project that contains our intellectual property and that you
will instruct any site that mirrors your files to also cease such
distribution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Please note that
nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of any potential remedy
available to Id Software, Inc., and as such, we reserve all rights
and remedies available to us at law or otherwise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Sincerely,
</FONT></P>
