Galactic Catacombs 3D


 S T O R Y :
  The year is 3057 and Earth has been destroyed by an unstoppable
alien race. You are Ace "Space boy" Robertson, a star pilot who's
job is to search for habitable planets for the human race. The
survivors of the destroyed Earth are currently living on a space
station. They would stay there but life support is, unfortunately,
running low.

  You found a habitable planet but before you got a chance to 
report it in on your computer and send the information back to the
station, a missile was fired from some ruins and smashed up your
ship pretty badly. You were forced to make an emergency landing 
and you had crashed into the ruins, which appear to be catacombs
or something. An alien is waiting right around the corner, and 
your mind is telling you to kill him with your Lazer Knife and
take his SR-16 Lazer Pistol. Regardless what you do to the alien,
you face the fact that you have to escape from these Galactic
Catacombs and report this planet to the station. Hopefully, all
of the hostiles will be terminated before the other humans 
arrive.
