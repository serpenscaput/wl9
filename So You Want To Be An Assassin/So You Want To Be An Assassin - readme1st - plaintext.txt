    Welcome to the sinister world of Nazi Germany.
So you wanna be an assassin, huh? Cool...but there are 5 guys with bad attitudes 
in your way before you can get the ultimate target, ADOLF himself, in your sights.

You must infiltrate a nasty, damp, and dark castle full of murdering NAZI filth and 
hideous mutants and a supernatural enemy that is so powerful that he can take you 
away from this world forever...Sounds like a Spear of Destiny episode, huh? It is, 
but only 7 levels and your prime mission: To assasinate all the bosses and escape...without 
getting yourself killed. or worse? You will find the famous Spear scattered around 
the various levels...beware, it could give you an extra life, or send you straight 
to hell....GAME OVER!  Each level has a different theme pretty much based on the 
Boss that inhabits it...There is also an armory on each level, sometimes hidden, 
sometimes not...and these are the only stashes of ammo...so you had better pick up 
all you can when you toast a guard etc...there is also limited first aid available...these 
levels are beatable, even on Death Incarnate so NO CHEATING!!! There are tons of 
other surprises as well, but then if I told you them, you wouldn't have any fun...My 
friend, Harry Mass Sr. has done a level for this set and Paul Gibson donated the 
Armory Graphics from his excellent "Operation: Knightwolf" set...Thanks,Paul..and 
as always thanks to Harry for his never-ending help and editing skills. If you have 
comments or complaints, you know my e-mail by now, I hope.... john_bucksnort (at) yahoo.com 
  Remember, your comments are always welcome and you know I have a special place 
for complaints...Enjoy this set, and good luck surviving, you'll need it!!! BWAHAHAHAHA...Hey 
Mo!!!!!
