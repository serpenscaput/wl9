Extra levels for Spear of Destiny Mission One Configuration

                             FOREWARD
It is now 1995, and late into it for that matter, so you may not see the
value of having any new Spear of Destiny levels! Why should anyone spend 
time making any new ones when we now have DOOM, DOOM II, HERETIC, Rise of
The Triad and Dark Forces!? I have all of those too! I decided to have some
fun with the forgotten classic because I am tired of spending money for
every new game that comes along and as an experiment I decided to see
if Spear could be as much fun as it originally was- it is! I have used all
the undocumented features that I could to make this set of levels different 
from any of the originals and all others in existence! You will see ghost
dogs in one of the secret levels. Force fields exist that you can see 
through but not walk through. My NAZIS are not static therefore they are
unpredicatable! Have you noticed how the "better" games still have enemies
that you know exactly where they will appear? You won't get the repeat play
with my new Spear levels as you experience in the more "advanced" games! I
do have guards that still stay and mind their posts but many patrols are
loose too! Those doors you hear slamming aren't hollow sound effects but
actual guards seeking the invading schweinehund! I made the levels compact
and not overly wandering BUT still challenging! You will notice that some
locked doors exist that you can't open with either key- these are guards
that wish to be left alone and they will make their appearance in all due
time! If you set the skill level for one then even your kid sister should
even be able to play. Skill level one has no dogs to kill nor assaulting
mutants but edge up to skill level three and you will have an ordeal that
the neo-phyte will not be able to handle. Go to skill level four and you
will see that I pulled out all the stops- you had better become a miser of
chicken dinners and ammunition if you expect to make it through! These 
levels are my ninth configuration in working out bugs such as hard to see
guards or things blocking your view (such as ammo). By the way did I mention
that one must watch their back while playing at higher skill levels- this
would probably be a good idea also on skill level one in some areas!
 

This is FREEWARE. If you don't like the levels, you are free to change them
to your tastes and I will not be insulted- you'll still be using my 
creativity as a foundation! I have downloaded other levels that are totally
un-realistic and most important- un-playable! I do not have 50 mutants 
assaulting you or have less ammo available than there are enemies- I am
even speaking of the ammo you get from the recipients of your marksmanship!
You will still need to watch yourself on the higher skill levels and be
very resourceful to get through- this is the realistic challenge!

As I have said, I have tried to make the levels play different every time.
The game actually responds to how you play and how you time your assaults!
You may notice sometimes you think you'll be overwhelmed and the next
time you play (using the same skill level) the enemy will probably assault
you in a different way! On some levels you may even notice that your kill
level percentage even exceeds 100%. You may shoot ghosts to get some easy
points and they come back again just to get shot again and again- this adds
to your kill ratio BUT burns up your ammo too!

These levels are in no way connected to Id or Apogee Software nor the
FormGen Corporation. If I made a mistake don't call them! (Don't call me
either- "Just deal with it trooper!")

Here is a suggestion that you can use to make changing your gamemaps and
mapheads a lot less painful. Before you install my files in your Spear of
Destiny, copy your GAMEMAPS.SOD and MAPHEAD.SOD to a floppy. Now is 
the neat trick. If you collect a lot of maps, as I do, copy them to their
own sub-directories and add these two custom files to each subdirectory:

 COPY *.SOD %1 <Y.TXT (Name and save this one liner as SWAP.BAT)
 Y   (Name and save this one character as Y.TXT)

If you placed these two files in every subdirectory that have maps, then
all you have to do to change missions is to exit your game, put in the disk
with your files in the appropriate floppy drive and log to the subdirectory
with your desired mission files. Follow me so far!? Now let us assume that
your Spear of Destiny is on your C:\ drive in \SPEAR or C:\SPEAR, you need
to only type on the DOS command line  SWAP C:\SPEAR and your files are 
copied to your Spear of Destiny game without any error or "do you want to
overwrite" prompts because the Y.TXT file answers for you!

If you really want to be slick and save space you can pkzip your two files,
run the zip2exe program on the archive to make it self extracting and embed
it in the SWAP.BAT instead. Let us say you named your self extracting file
FORTRESS.EXE all you have to do to make a proper SWAP.BAT is:

FORTRESS.EXE -O -D %1  (Save as SWAP.BAT of course) The -O is the letter O
not the numeral 0. 

When you run this, instead of the copy command, pkzip will do the right 
stuff without any further input. You still use the SWAP C:\SPEAR entry 
though!

Here is one much coveted "Cheat Code" that is not widely known. If you
purchased the CD-ROM version of Spear of Destiny put out by FormGen you are
undoubtedly ticked at being a victim of a documentation check as a form of
copy protection. You know the routine! Apogee has released Spear of Destiny
without the copy protection- for those that are possessors of the earlier
FormGen version- just type SNOOPS at the documentation check and stop 
fumbling for your manual. If you have seen the movie War Games then you 
might type JOSHUA at the documentation check just for the fun of it! 
You can also make a simple batch file and call it BACKDOOR and have it load
Spear for you and bypass all the opening screens!

ECHO OFF
CLS
SPEAR -DEBUGMODE -NORMAL -TEDLEVEL

Save as BACKDOOR.BAT and your Spear will bypass the documentation check
altogether, put you in debugmode, have you in the bring 'em on skill level,
and on floor one! (You still have to activate using the LEFT SHIFT, LEFT ALT
and Backspace keys.)

Look for the file WMAP12.zip in this archive it has David Lummis' Wolfmap
V1.2- I have included some batch patches that will let you make maps of your
Spear of Destiny levels! I know of no other routine that is capable of 
making maps for the Spear series of Wolfenstein 3D. The stock Wolfmap V1.2
only maps Wolfenstein 3D.

Enjoy and happy hunting! Did I mention you should watch your back!? 
GUT HEIL!
Herr Bradbury saying Auf Wiedersen

P.S. I deliberately made the Bosses into half awake zombies that just
stand there in a trance. Fire one shot in their direction and see how
hacked off they get for you disturbing their slumber- you had better be
quick on your feet as in "feets don't fail me now!"
Some of the exit elevators can be reached by secret passageways and in
"config9" they aren't marked with blood spots on the floor as always the
case in my previous releases. You can also find the Spear on the first
floor, but it is very well hidden! If you find it you'll go to the final
showdown with the Death Angel and bypassing all other levels. You will be
credited points for your actions on floor 1 but any victories on the final
showdown will show all zeroes! I guess the game engine can't handle the
quantum leap so the challenge is to find the Spear and then play all the
other levels by starting anew. If you don't want to get shot to pieces at
higher skill levels don't run like a chicken with its head cut off- you will
only alert more guards to join in the assault! Save often in suspicious
areas and don't follow my advice always against running- trust your 
instincts and run like hell if you have to! I put more hours into these
levels than some have put in their DOOM wads! If these levels are accepted
favorably then I will upload more- if NOT I have some other irons in the 
fire! I also intend to make levels for the other Apogee (id) masterpieces
also and the Spear of Destiny adventure lets me get my feet wet without the
tediousness of dealing with linedefs! If it took me hours to get the Spear 
of Destiny done, then what would be the case of DOOM or Rise Of The Triad? 
I still like my SOD and my original 60 level Wolfenstein 3D too!
Any thing seen behind "windows" can be had but you must find the secret
passageway to the treasures! By the way- did I mention that you should watch
your back while playing my levels? Turn about is fair play and you should
consider becoming a skillful back stabber yourself- save some ammo, use your
knife and don't alert other guards! rsb
