Extra levels for Spear of Destiny Mission One Configuration
From the imaginuity of Robert S. Bradbury  (at) COMPSERVE 75561,1550

This is FREEWARE and if you don't like it, you are free to change it to your
tastes and I will not be insulted- you'll still be using my creativity as a
foundation!

These levels are in no way connected to Id or Apogee Software nor the
FormGen Corporation. If I made a mistake don't call them! (Don't call me
either- "Just deal with it trooper!")

I really hope that FESTUNG is appreciated for it is not just random pieces
thrown together. I followed the discipline that form is the result of proper
planning and order. My levels are mainly linear in scope without being 
overly "mazey," although I do have mazes in the levels. 

Be especially careful in navigating the tighter areas though, for they are
a bit more hazardous! Festungs or fortresses are not known for creature
comforts or roominess. Remember during the Nazi scourge a favorite past time
was confining as much of the populace as possible, hence all the detainment
areas!

I set my floor codes so my soldiers will answer some times with a shot 
being fired, some will wait and some will run and hide to bushwhack you!
You may have cleaned an area to only come back and find one in wait for you
if you get too careless!  MAK SCHNELL SCHWEINE HUND!

About finding secret areas, I have taken some of the pain out of it! I put
a universal clue to all of the areas saying you are close. But just because
you see the hint does not mean a secret area is nearby. Placement is the
key! Okay, the universal hint item is what you can't squeeze from a rock!

My keys follow a linear progression in the progress of the level, they are
not placed in a niche in some dusty corner- remember the Nazis were orderly!

Here is a suggestion that you can use to make changing your gamemaps and
mapheads a lot less painful. Before you install my files in your Spear of
Destiny, copy your GAMEMAPS.SOD and MAPHEAD.SOD to a floppy. Now is the neat
trick. If you collect a lot of maps, as I do, copy them to their own sub-
directories and add these two custom files to each subdirectory:

 COPY *.SOD %1 <Y.TXT (Name and save this one liner as SWAP.BAT)
 Y   (Name and save this one character as Y.TXT)

If you placed these two files in every subdirectory that have maps, then
all you have to do to change missions is to exit your game, put in the disk
with your files in the appropriate floppy drive and log to the subdirectory
with your desired mission files. Follow me so far!? Now let us assume that
your Spear of Destiny is on your C:\ drive in \SPEAR or C:\SPEAR, you need
to only type on the DOS command line  SWAP C:\SPEAR and your files are 
copied to your Spear of Destiny game without any error or "do you want to
overwrite" prompts because the Y.TXT file answers for you!

If you really want to be slick and save space you can pkzip your two files,
run the zip2exe program on the archive to make it self extracting and embed
it in the SWAP.BAT instead. Let us say you named your self extracting file
FESTUNG.EXE all you have to do to make a proper SWAP.BAT is:

FESTUNG %1 <Y.TXT (Save as SWAP.BAT of course)

When you run this, instead of the copy command, pkzip will still flash the
"overwrite?" prompt but you don't have to answer- it will do the right stuff
without any further input. You still use the SWAP C:\SPEAR entry though!

Here is one much coveted "Cheat Code" that is not widely known. If you
purchased the CD-ROM version of Spear of Destiny put out by FormGen you are
undoubtedly ticked at being a victim of a documentation check as a form of
copy protection. You know the routine! Apogee has released Spear of Destiny
without the copy protection- for those that are possessors of the earlier
FormGen version- just type SNOOPS at the documentation check and stop 
fumbling for your manual. You can also make a simple batch file and call it
BACKDOOR and have it load Spear for you and bypass all the opening screens!

ECHO OFF
CLS
SPEAR -DEBUGMODE -NORMAL -TEDLEVEL

Save as BACKDOOR.BAT and your Spear will bypass the documentation check
altogether, put you in debugmode, have you in the bring 'em on skill level,
and on floor one! (You still have to activate using the LEFT SHIFT, LEFT ALT
and Backspace keys.)

Look for the file WOLFMAP#2.zip on this BBS and if you have David Lummis'
Wolfmap V1.2 this will give you some batch patches that will let you make
maps of your Spear of Destiny levels! I know of no other routine that is
capable of making maps for the Spear series of Wolfenstein 3D.


Enjoy and happy hunting! GUT HEIL!
