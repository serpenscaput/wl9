Extra levels for Spear of Destiny Mission One Configuration
From the imaginuity of Robert S. Bradbury

This set of twenty one levels is called bestof#1 because it is compiled
from other configurations that I had worked on on some still in the works.

I really hope that they are appreciated for they are not just random pieces
thrown together. I followed the discipline that form is the result of proper
planning and order. My levels are mainly linear in scope without being 
overly "mazey," although I do have mazes in the levels. I filled up each
level with few large areas and not the norm of a bunch of small areas or
rooms. The Nazi architect, Albert Speer, always designed for wide areas
of grandeur. You'll notice large ballroom areas and dining halls- my Spear
of Destiny Nazis are Oktoberfest type soldiers that love their beer and
wurst!

Be especially careful in navigating the tighter areas though, for they are
a bit more hazardous! Festungs or fortresses are not known for creature
comforts or roominess.

I set my floor codes so my soldiers will answer some times with a shot 
being fired, some will wait and some will run and hide to bushwhack you!
You may have cleaned an area to only come back and find one in wait for you
if you get too careless! I'll be honest with you also, on a level or two
you will think Nazis are literally coming out of the "woodwork"- they are
and you had better not linger. MAK SCHNELL SCHWEINE HUND!

About finding secret areas, I have taken some of the pain out of it! I put
a universal clue to all of the areas saying you are close. But just because
you see the hint does not mean a secret area is nearby. Placement is the
key! Okay the universal hint item is what you can't squeeze from a rock!

My keys follow a linear progression in the progress of the level, they are
not placed in a niche in some dusty corner- remember the Nazis were orderly!

Here is a suggestion that you can use to make changing your gamemaps and
mapheads a lot less painful. Before you install my files in your Spear of
Destiny copy your GAMEMAPS.SOD and MAPHEAD.SOD to a floppy. Now is the neat
trick. If you collect a lot of maps as I do copy them to their own sub-
directories and add these two custom files to each subdirectory:

 COPY *.SOD %1 <Y.TXT (Name and save this one liner SWAP.BAT)
 Y   (Name and save this one character as Y.TXT)

If you placed these two files in every subdirectory that you have maps, then
all you have to do to change missions is to exit your game, put in the disk
with your files in the appropriate floppy drive and log to the subdirectory
with your desired mission files. Follow me so far!? Now let us assume that
your Spear of Destiny is on your C:\ drive in \SPEAR or C:\SPEAR, you need
to only type on the DOS command line  SWAP C:\SPEAR and your files are 
copied to your Spear of Destiny game without any error or "do you want to
overwrite" prompts because the Y.TXT file answers for you!

If you really want to be slick and save space you can pkzip your two files,
run the zip2exe program on the archive to make it self extracting and embed
it in the SWAP.BAT instead. Let us say you named your self extracting file
FORTRESS.EXE all you have to do to make a proper SWAP.BAT is:

FORTRESS %1 <Y.TXT (Save as SWAP.BAT of course)

When you run this instead of the copy command pkzip will still flash the
"overwrite?" prompt but you don't have to answer it will do the right stuff
without any further input. You still use the SWAP C:\SPEAR entry though!

Enjoy and happy hunting! GUT HEIL!
