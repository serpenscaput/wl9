YE OLDE MAPS by Hacksaw

These are a couple of old maps (not the first) that I did.

The first map was meant to have an outdoorsy feel (even though you can't get
anything but grey ceilings in the original Wolf3d...) There are a lot of open spaces 
in the map.

The second was made to be like a bunker.

These maps were made not too long after I got the registered copy of Wolf3d. They 
were made with an older version of WDC. 

For this distribution, I removed the other maps in the file (that were from the original 
registered version of Wolf3D) from the files with ChaosEdit.
