^C7d THE STORY

^G32,16,3
^C00 It is May 1944.The war with the nazis was still on.The mission was to fly to 
Egypt to explore the Pyramid of the Shadow Gods.The place was dangerous with rotting 
skeletons and nazis who entered the pyramid were killed by something horrible.Some 
monster by the name of 333.Black bodies were seemed to be wandering.

^P
^C7d THE STORY

^C00 BJ was being flown to the Command Center used by the nazis.The base has information 
on the Pyramid.BJ was going to find out more about this creature and hoped that it 
could stopped before something really bad could happen.He was sitting at base talking 
to General Monaghan.He knew he would have to be careful on missions to stop the nazis.Nazis 
including Velme Dainton were attempting to destroy the pyramid and make a mess of 
it.

^P
^C7d THE STORY

^C00 BJ was ready to be flown to Germany.He knew he would have to take care even 
if the mission was going to sound suicidal.And he had to explore The Pyramid of the 
Shadowgods.It was best to be careful.BJ could afford to die in a pyramid along with 
nazis.But he had to be careful on the way.

^C7d FEATURES

^G22,175,30
^C2b Operation 333 ^C00is based on the Project Totengraeber source code.I would like 
to thank BJ Rowan and FormGen Corporation.Rather than just deciding add-ons I thought 
about having source code changes for my TC.Some add-ons I played on were interesting, 
^C2bOperation 333 ^C00 has features from Project Totengraeber,spear music,ambient 
sounds,seamless levels and a lot of other stuff.

^P
^C7d FEATURES

^C00 * Over 40 brand new levels
* One massive episode with seamless level flow
* Changed ceiling colors & music
* Two new keys with icons on the status bar
* Chainguns that occasionally jam and require you to find a new one
* New help screens, end art, demos, and lots more

^C7d NEW KEYS

^G25,16,31
^C2b The Bronze Key ^C00is usually used to hide secret areas or elevators to secret 
levels. On some levels, you may need this key just to escape to the next floor.

^G86,16,32
^C2b The Elevator Key ^C00is a special keycard used to unlock certain elevator doors 
themselves. You can easily recognize elevator doors locked by the elevator key, as 
they have a yellow knob with a card slot directly beneath it.

^C7d NEW HEALTH ITEMS

^G25,16,34
^C2b Adrenaline Hypos ^C00give you a 2% health boost, up to 200% health. Developed 
by Arzt Schabbs, these become more plentiful as you get closer to Schabbs' bunker 
and laboratories.

^G86,16,35
^C00 The ^C2bAdrenaline Health Kit ^C00contains an experimental dosage of adrenaline 
and other pharmaceuticals which give you an instant health boost to 125%, or 25% 
additional if you are already above 100%. They also give you an extra life.
