^C00 You killed Shadowgod 333 and ran out through a door.In front of you was another 
door.You ran at it and it opened.Then a wall opened and you were out of the Pyramid.An 
aircraft was above and began to land.

You jumped in and flew off.The mission was over.Velme Dainton was dead and evidence 
was recovered from the pyramid.You were glad it was over.

B.J. Blazkowicz, you've single-handedly been on one of the most dangerous and toughest 
missions in allied history.Glad you were safe.The Shadowgod is dead but the spectres 
were scary.
