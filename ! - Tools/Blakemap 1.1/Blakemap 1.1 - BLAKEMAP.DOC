Notes  : This program is used to generate ASCII maps for the Blake Stone
         Aliens of Gold game.

         This program has been tested with the shareware version of Blake,
         version 1.0 and 2.0.  It has been designed to work with the 3 and
         6 episode versions of the game as well (assuming the encoding of
         the map files doesn't change, etc, when they are released).

         The /C, /T2, and /T3 options are intended for generating maps that
         should be helpful if you want to modify the configuration file.
         /T2 and /T3 will generate hex dumps of the maps so that you can
         see what value has been assigned to something you see on the
         screen.  The /FC option can be used to specify the name of an
         alternate configuration file.

         If you don't specify an episode and/or level number when you run
         BLAKEMAP then the program will ask you for the missing information.

Install: Copy all the files into the Blake Stone data directory.  It is from
         this directory that the program must be run.

         For those that don't want to run the program, a set of maps has
         already been created for all 11 levels of the shareware game.

Syntax:

  BLAKEMAP [ <option>[ ...]]

Valid <option>s:

  /L<n>      Level number (0 to 10, or * for all).
  /G<n>      Game (episode) number (1 to 6).

  /E-        Suppress display of enemies (/T0 maps only).

  /O1        Display all objects.
  /O2        Display non-trivial objects only. (default)
  /O-        Suppress all objects (/T0 maps only).

  /2         Use two characters per item on symbolic maps (/T0 and /T1 only)

  /T0        Map type 0: Symbolic. (default)
  /T1        Map type 1: Symbolic.
  /T2        Map type 2: Full hex dump.  Not affected by /O.
  /T3        Map type 3: Partial hex dump.

  /C         Create a file containing counts of map and object values

  /X         Display  hexadecimal X scale on maps. (default)
  /X-        Suppress hexadecimal X scale on maps.
  /Y         Display  hexadecimal Y scale on maps. (default)
  /Y-        Suppress hexadecimal Y scale on maps.

  /FC<file>  Filename of BLAKEMAP Configuration file (default is BLAKEMAP.CFG)

  /?         Display this help screen.
  /?-        Display this help screen (no pausing).


Required files:

   The current directory is searched for the following files:

      1) The program will first look for MAPHEAD.BS6 (which will should
         contain all 6 episodes).

      2) If MAPHEAD.BS6 was not found, it looks for MAPHEAD.BS3 which should
         contain episodes 1 to 3.

      3) If MAPHEAD.BS3 was not found, then it looks for MAPHEAD.BS1 which
         should contain episode 1 only (shareware version).

      4) When generating maps, BLAKEMAP will also look for the appropriate
         MAPTEMP.BS? (BSTONE v1.0, 2.0) file.  If MAPTEMP.BS? is not found it
         will search for GAMEMAPS.BS? (GAMEMAPS was the name used for v1.1
         and later of WOLF3D).

      5) The program will search the current directory for the configuration
         file BLAKEMAP.CFG.  If you have used the /FC option, then BLAKEMAP
         will look for the configuration file you have specified instead.

       BMAP<g>L<nn>.T3C  Partial hex.  Object data only.     No 00's.

  /C   BMAP<g>.COU       Table.        Count of map and object data by level

  where: <g>  = game  number (1 to 6)

Revisions:

v1.1 - Added a new section to the BLAKEMAP.CFG file to allow users to
       specify the entry number in the MAPHEAD file which points to the
       first map (secret level 0) for each level in the MAPTEMP file.

       This was to accomodate the fact that there appears to be 15 entries
       per level in the MAPHEAD file (1 secret, 10 regular, and 4 unused),
       rather than the 11 that was assumed in v1.0 of BLAKEMAP.

       The default values provided in the BLAKEMAP.CFG file should work
       assuming 15 entries per level in the MAPHEAD file.
