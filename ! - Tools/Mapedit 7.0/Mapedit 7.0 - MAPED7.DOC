GENERAL DISCUSSION OF MAP DATATYPES:

In Wolf 3-D there are two different types of data that can be assigned
to a given square.  One is known as "map" data, and the other is "object"
data.  Examples of "map" data are: various wall types, doors, and "floor
codes".  "Object" data is all of the other scenery (treasure, food, ammo,
tables, etc.)  Guards are also considered to be object data.  MAPEDIT
requires map and object "definition" files to specify the symbol and
provide a short bit of text to remind you of what each specific item is.
These definition files are described below.  At any time, MAPEDIT is in
either "Map Mode" or "Object Mode" depending on which Legend is currently
being displayed.  You toggle the mode by either pressing the space bar or
clicking the appropriate box below the Legend window.

The left and right mouse buttons can each be assigned a "map" code and
an "object" code.  Thus you can have 4 different codes (2 map and
2 object) at your fingertips.  You switch between them by toggling the
Legend.  You can assign values to the mouse buttons in 2 ways: (1) by
selecting the desired item in the Legend window, or (2) by "memorizing"
an item by holding either shift key and clicking the desired mouse button
while pointing to the desired item in the Map window.  Note that the
datatype (map or object) that is memorized depends on the current Legend
mode.

The map or object datatype that is currently assigned to the left mouse
button is displayed in the lower left corner of the MAPEDIT window.
Unfortunately, the screen is very full, and there is no room to display
the current value assigned to the right mouse button.  You've got to
remember it. Sorry.


MAP WINDOW:

Whenever the mouse is in the map window, the map and object data for the
selected square will be displayed beneath the window.  Clicking either
mouse button will change either the map or object data in the map to the
item currently assigned to that button.  The datatype that is assigned
(either map or object) depends on the current Legend mode.

Holding down the shift key and selecting a map/object value using the
left/right mouse button will memorize that value for that button.  (See
General Discussion above)


LEGEND WINDOW:

The window on the right side of the screen displays the map/object legend.
Clicking on UP/DOWN or pressing the page up/down keys scrolls through the
list.  Clicking on MAP/OBJ switches between the map and object lists.
Clicking on an item in the list with the left mouse button makes it the
"current" item for the left button.  Clicking on an item using the right
mouse button will make it the "current" item for the right button.

After each guard, there is a 3 character description which specifies
what level the guard is, whether they are moving or stationary, and
what direction they are facing/walking.  For example, "1/S/E" means
a level 1 guard, stationary, facing east.


MEMORIZE, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE FUNCTIONS:

***********************************************************************
***** Note: Always make backups of your gamemap files before      *****
***** using these commands. Save your MAPHEAD.WL1 and MAPTEMP.WL1 *****
***** or MAPHEAD.WL6 and GAMEMAPS.WL6 or MAPHEAD.SOD and          *****
***** GAMEMAPS.SOD.                                               *****
***********************************************************************

With these operations you can move maps from one floor to another.  If you
want to copy a floor, move to the floor you want to copy and press the 'M'
key.  The Memorize line in the help display will turn yellow indicating that
you have a stored floor in the clipboard.  This will now stay yellow for the
rest of the session because there will always be something stored.  You can
now Transfer (Paste) the Memorized floor wherever you want.  Move to the
floor where you want the stored floor to be and either press 'T' to Transfer
the stored floor on top of the presently displayed floor or press 'E' to
exchange the displayed floor with the Memorized floor.  The Exchange function
allows you to easily move the floors up or down a level.  If the Memorize line
in the Help display is not yellow (nothing stored) these functions won't work.
They will flash red for this case.

If you use the Transfer operation you will lose the floor that you copied the
Memorized floor on top of.  If the Statistics display is on the display will
flip to the help display during the Memorize, Transfer and Exchange operations
and then flip back to the statistics display.


READ AND WRITE FUNCTIONS:

If you want to share floor maps or create floor maps with a group or if
you have designed a favorite floor in one version of Wolfenstein and would
like to move it to a different version you can now do it with these functions.
Use the 'W' command to write a floor file to disk.  You will be prompted
for a filename.  Enter up to eight characters + up to three character
extension.  To read a floor file from disk, use the 'R' command.  Again,
you will be prompted for the filename.  The file will be read into the
clipboard.  In order to place it into the actual map file, use either the
'E' or 'T' command.

A major advantage of exporting/importing by file is that you now can share
your floors with others without having to give them the whole gamemap/maphead
files.  All you have to do is give them the file saved using the write
command.  They can then read in the file and use either the 'E' or 'T'
command to place it into their map file.


CLEAR LEVEL:

Pressing the 'C' key will Clear the current floor placing grey brick on the
outside edge and filling the inside with the selected map value.  Before you
clear the display select the map value you want to fill with then press 'C'.
You can fill with any map value.  If the last item you selected was an Object
then if you Clear before selecting a map value the clear function will fill
using a floor value of '6C'.


HELP:

The major hot keys are listed in the help display.


STATISTICS DISPLAY:

The statistics display keeps track of the following information:

         Number of Static Objects
         Total number of Guards
         Total number of Doors

         Number of Level 1 Guards
         Number of Level 3 Guards
         Number of Level 4 Guards
         Number of Boss Guards

         Number of Secret Doors
         Number of Treasure and Extra Lives

This information can be very useful in designing levels.  There are
some program limits that must not be exceeded.  These limits are:

    400 Static Objects
    150 Guards
     64 Doors (Unlocked + Locked + Elevator Doors)

When these limits are exceeded, the text changes to red as a visual
warning.

You can control what object information is displayed in the map using
the '1' ... '6' keys (see key functions above).  This allows you to
easily balance the # guards, etc, as you are designing your maps.


MAP AND OBJECT DEFINITION FILES:

MAPDATA.DEF and OBJDATA.DEF
MAPDATA.WL1 and OBJDATA.WL1
MAPDATA.WL6 and OBJDATA.WL6
MAPDATA.SOD and OBJDATA.SOD

MapEdit will try to open the *.def files 1'st.  If they are not found it
will try to open the files with the same extension as the game map file
found (ie. - if gamemap.sod was found then it will look for the
mapdata.sod and objdata.sod files.  You can now keep definition files
for each version of Wolfenstein you are running.  For the 30 level game
MapEdit opens the *.WL6 files.

If you figure out a new object or want to change the description, you can
add/change it's description to the object/map list by editing the
MAPDATA.xxx or OBJDATA.xxx file.  Each line in the file contains 3 items:

0000 0000 Objectname

The first four digits are HEX for the object number.  Right now, even
though their are 4 digits, you can only put objects from 0000-00ff in.

** Note version 4.1a allows up to 0116.

The second four digits define how the object will look in the map.
The first two digits are the primary/secondary colors.  The third
digit is the graphic type, and the fourth digit is the character
string to use if the graphic type is "text".

Colors:
   0 - black
   1 - blue
   2 - green
   3 - cyan
   4 - red
   5 - magenta
   6 - brown
   7 - light grey
   8 - dark grey
   9 - light blue
   a - light green
   b - light cyan
   c - light red
   d - light magenta
   e - yellow
   f - white

Graphic types:

   0 - text (uses fourth character of graphic definition)
   1 - solid box
   2 - checkered
   3 - solid box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   4 - checkered box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   5 - large filled circle (primary) with smaller circle (secondary)
   6 - horizontal bar
   7 - vertical bar
   8 - two color box (used for landscape view)
   9 - single pixel centered
   a - 3x3 pixel block
   b - 3x5 pixel block
   c -
   d - X (primary)
   e - rectangle
   f - arrow  (secondary color indicates direction: 0=n,1=ne,2=e,3=se,
                                                    4=s,5=sw,6=w,7=nw)

   This program would not have been possible without Paul (Hosko) Hosken,
author of WMAP, who figured out the original map file formats.

Thanks Hosko!
