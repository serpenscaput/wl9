Welcome to the latest revision of MAPEDIT! To find out what is new in
Version 8.3, view the file "WHATS.NEW".

The entire Mapedit package has been reorganized into a common section
plus sections unique to the game or games you intend to edit. Each
section is contained within its own Zipped file. When you unzip the
main package, just unzip the section(s) you are interested in.

If you want to create new floors for either Blake Stone game, you
need to read BSTONE.DOC to get acquainted with all the new features
that are these games. You'll also want to read the section in
MAPEDIT.DOC that explains how the Blake Stone features are implemented.
Those who wish to create/edit floors for either Corridor 7 or Body
Count should read the documentation provided for these games.

To print the documents, use the DOS COPY command to PRN or LPT1.

You should take a look at the MANIFEST file to get a quick briefing
on what each file in the package is and does.

Please be advised that Version 8.3 will not edit shareware versions
of any of the games it supports. If you experience any problems with
either MAPEDIT or any of the floors you create with it, contact one
of the authors. DO NOT CONTACT any of the companies which distribute
or manufacture the games. We thank you for your cooperation in this
matter.

We are also announcing at this time that Mapedit Support is starting
to "wind down", but we aren't precluding the possibility of making
reasonable enhancements in the future. Especially if another game
using the Wolf3D engine is released by someone. We will also continue
to accept any suggestions for improvements or any reports of problems
(bugs) in the latest version.

Thank you.
