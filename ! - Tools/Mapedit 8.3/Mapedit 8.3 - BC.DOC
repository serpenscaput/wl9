       Introduction

       Operation: Body Count is the 2nd game from IntraCorp, Inc. that
       uses an engine licensed from id Software. The first was Corridor 7.
       Body Count utilizes many of the same features developed especially
       for Corridor 7. (See the Corridor 7 document in this package for a
       list of features new to these two games from IntraCorp. Inc.

       As far as creating floors for Body Count is concerned, the approach
       does not differ markedly from creating floors for Wolf3D, Spear of
       Destiny, Blake Stone, or Corridor 7. If you have never created a
       floor for any of these games before, it is recommended that you
       read through "Tips for Creating/Editing Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny
       Designs". This document is included in the Mapedit package. The
       above document will give you a flavor for what is involved.

       DATA DEFINITION FILES

       MAPEDIT provides data definition files for all games it supports.
       One of these is the MAPDATA file which incorporates graphic symbols
       for all the walls and doors that appear in Body Count. The other
       file is the OBJDATA file which contains graphics symbols that
       represent everything else in the game. The descriptions that appear
       in the MAPEDIT legend window are mostly too long to fit in the
       limited space so you must scroll the legend window horizontally to
       read the entire description. The descriptions are lengthy due to
       the complex graphic designs.

       New Features in Body Count

       To those of you who have played previous 3-D games, the most
       obvious new feature that is immediately apparent in Body Count (as
       well as in its predecessor Corridor 7) is the use of solid "glass"
       walls through which one can clearly see what is on the other side.
       This "see-through" feature is extended to certain types of doors as
       well as other wall types that partition off the floor space.

       Note: Enemies cannot see through any type of wall. If they can be
       seen moving rapidly about on the other side of a "see-thru" wall,
       it is because they have shifted to Attack Mode for some reason not
       related to the "see-through" feature.

       Another interesting feature is the use of "pseudo" animation. Much
       of the movement is inherent and controlled by the engine. Some of
       it needs to be overtly triggered by the floor designer with the use
       of certain triggering object codes. A set of triggering object
       codes is also used to activate the "see-through" feature mentioned
       in the previous paragraph.

       Body Count Design Considerations

       Several features, which may not be obvious at first when playing
       the game, are included to make play more interesting and difficult.
       One of these is how the use of certain types of doors will prevent
       the player's shots from passing through an open doorway.

       Essentially, two types of doors are used in Body Count. The
       traditional sliding door (mostly elevator doors) is recognized by
       the game's engine as a real door and when the player shoots through
       an open sliding door, the shots will pass through and hit their
       target. Both the player and the actor can see one another.

       The other type of door used (non-sliding) is really a wall with a
       special object code on it that makes it appear to be a door. It
       opens and closes using special animation techniques. Both the player
       and actors can move back and forth unhindered through these doors.
       But ammunition will not penetrate the open doorway. The player is
       forced to wait until an enemy has come through such a door before
       any ammo will hit the target. Alternatively, the player can move
       to the other side of the door. As a result, if enemies are seen
       unmoving on the other side of such a door, the player is forced to
       go in after them rather than waiting for them to come out. Further,
       if enemies are moving towards the doorway, they will not start
       shooting until they pass completely through the doorway.

       Another element over which you as a designer will have no control
       and which makes for more difficult play, mostly occurs when the
       game is played at skill levels 3 and R (random). At these higher
       skill levels, the player will occasionally find an enemy actor that
       will not be killed easily. This includes rats, humans, and the
       flying turrets. The player, if not careful, can use up a lot of
       ammo when trying to dispose of these actors. (The player needs to
       switch to the flame-thrower for rats and humans. The flying turrets
       are a challenge, but can be destroyed with rocket grenades (flames
       cannot touch them). To reduce the number of instances where a
       player has to engage a super-enemy, the player must be more
       aggressive and not hang back waiting for the enemy to come to
       him/her.)

       A final element over which you will have no control as you design
       floors for Body Count occurs when the game is played at the random
       level of difficulty. This degree of difficulty is similar to level
       3 except that the player will see many more floor mines (booby
       traps) scattered throughout most floors, that do not exist on the
       floor as it was originally designed. On the other hand, during
       random play, many of the items that were previously hidden from
       view such as Health Packs, Weapons, etc., will usually be much
       easier to find because most of them will appear out in the open.
       Also, enemies will occasionally show up within hidden rooms that
       are accessible via a pushwall.

       More Body Count Design Considerations

       Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny are prison and castle environments. As
       such, the use of narrow corridors is in keeping with the spirit of
       the game (although many wide halls and corridors were used too).
       Hidden rooms entered through pushwalls contained treasure and
       caches of ammo and weapons, but sometimes pushwalls were used as
       shortcuts to other areas.

       Blake Stone occurs in a futuristic sci-fi environment. While there
       were many alien type creatures created by Dr. Goldfire, there were
       also humans. The floor designs were not generally dungeon-like in
       appearance. Hidden rooms were used in virtually the same manner as
       in Wolf3d and SoD.

       Corridor 7 suggests an entirely different environment: a modern
       office and lab complex on earth, which is being slowly converted to
       an out-of-world environment suitable for supporting the alien life
       that is occupying it. Aside from our Space Marine, there are no
       other live humans. Narrow halls are the exception rather than the
       rule.

       Operation: Body Count takes place in twin UN Buildings plus 5 sewer
       levels. There are only humans, rats, and flying turrets. The
       environment is modern and graphics have been designed with this in
       mind.

       Hidden Areas, Push Walls

       Body Count, like its predecessor Corridor 7, contains no treasure.
       Hidden areas normally contain weapons, ammo, flak jackets, heat
       sensors, health packs, and other devices helpful to the survival of
       the player. Many pushwalls can and must be pushed more than once in
       order to reach what is hidden. Pushwalls move 2 squares (or cells)
       at a time. To move the wall again, it must stop on another push
       wall object code.

       Locked Doors

       There are no locked doors in Body Count. If a door doesn't open, it
       was not intended to open. These are doors that have not had a
       special object code placed on them to force the animation of a door
       opening/closing.

       Special Trigger Codes

       As indicated above, Body Count uses special object codes to cause
       certain walls/doors to appear animated or to be able to see through
       different wall and door types. These are listed below together with
       where and how each code is used.



                                       -6-
       
       Object
       Code     Description
       ----     -----------
       0056     Slow Speed Animation
       0057     Normal Speed Animation
       0058     High Speed Animation
       0067     Sliding Door "see thru" and open/close activator
       0068     Glass "see thru" activator
       0069     Wall "see thru" activator (incl. fences)
       006a     Non-sliding door activator with "see thru"
       006b     No Clipping activated for single map cell

       The above codes are inserted in the same cell on the map as the
       wall/door that is to be activated.

       How Animation Works

       Animation is implemented in the following way. When the program
       detects any wall type with an Animation code on it, the program
       displays the wall represented by that code and the following 3
       codes in rapid sequence. This causes the wall graphic to be
       animated. Any one of the 4 wall types used in the animation
       sequence could be used by itself without an Animation code, thus
       eliminating any movement.

       Animation speed codes are not used in conjunction with doors.
       These are reserved for certain wall graphics.  The speed is
       determined by which animation code you select.  Choose the one
       you think gives the effect you desire.

       There is a special type of animation that occurs for certain wall
       types when they are hit by the player's bullets. This animation
       occurs automatically without any overt action required by the
       designer.

       Non-Sliding Doors

       As mentioned above, there are 2 basic types of doors used in Body
       Count. The conventional doors slide left or right when opening.
       Such doors require no special triggering to make them operate.
       However, non-sliding doors do require special triggering.

       Because unconventional doors cannot be handled the same as the
       sliding doors, the animation effect must be applied so that four
       separate door codes are cycled through one time to see the door
       open and in reverse to see the door close. Object code '6a' is used
       for this purpose. It is inserted on the map in the same cell as the
       door that is to be operated.

       If you want to have one of these doors in the open position and not
       allow it to be closed, then choose the fully opened door code for




                                       -7-
       
       the door type you want and then use object code '6b' so that the
       door can be walked through. Code '6b' does 2 things. It makes a
       wall or door appear as a thin partition and then applies "no
       clipping" logic so that it can be walked through.

       To help you determine which doors/walls can be animated, the
       Mapdata legend window in Mapedit will provide one added piece of
       information: the trigger object code needed to animate the action.

       NETWORKING & Deathmatch Play

       There are 10 additional levels available for this purpose. They are
       levels 51 through 60. They have large open areas and lots of
       available ammo, weapons, health items, etc. There are no enemy
       actors in these levels.

       While starting locations are in each Network level, the game will
       assign random starting locations for each player at the start of
       the game.

       Debugging Your Levels

       Debugging codes do exist for this game, but it has not been learned
       how to implement them. If you know, or find out how, please notify
       one of the authors so the information can be added to this
       document.

       When you desire to test a floor, you can transfer the floor to
       level 1 so you don't have to work your way through other levels to
       get to your test floor. Be sure to save the original 1st floor so
       you can restore it later.
