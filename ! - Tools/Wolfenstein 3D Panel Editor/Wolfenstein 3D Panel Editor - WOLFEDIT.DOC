			Wolfenstein-3D Panel Editor
			---------------------------
This is a very simple graphics editor which permits the "panels" within the
VSWAP.WL6 file (provided with the ALL SIX EPISODES version v1.1/v1.?) to be
modified directly on screen. The utility must be placed within the \WOLF3D
directory because it assumes VSWAP.WL6 is in the current directory (crude).
If you do not yet own this version of the software, treat yourself and order
it from APOGEE/Id. Wolfenstein-3D is an incredible program and it's authors
deserve your support!.

Main Display
------------
When the editor is first loaded, the VSWAP.WL6 file is opened and the first
"panel" within the file is displayed. Section (A) always displays the panel
at 64x64 dots, 1x scaling. Section (B) displays the 256 color palette that
is organized in a 16x16 matrix. Section (C) and (D) display the panel using
either 2x or 3x scaling. Initially, 3x scaling is provided. (See diagram)

Controls
--------
Once the display is initialized, a blinking graphics dot is provided in
sections (A) and (C)/(D) and is the current cursor/pen position within
the 64x64 image. The standard arrow keys will move this cursor/pen and
are confined within the boundaries of the image. Panels are selected by
using the PGUP and PGDN keys and will stop at the first/last panel that
can be modified. A panel may only be edited while shown on the display
and does not become permanent unless specifically written back using the
write command (W) while displayed. Therefore, you may view the panels
using the PGDN/PGUP keys without changing any data. The HOME and END
keys are provided to quickly advance to the first and last panel (106).
Editing is performed using the color palette and the standard arrow keys.
Initially, the cursor/pen is a cursor which is non-destructive and can
be moved freely within the 64x64 image. The current plot color has been
initially defaulted to black (First position in the 256 color palette).
A point may be plotted using the point (P) command or they may be drawn
continuously using the draw (D) command. The draw (D) command is a toggle
which acts like pen on a plotter. When down, it draws, when up is doesn't.
The current plot color can be selected in two different ways. The get (G)
command obtains the new color directly from the 64x64 panel at the current
cursor and the set (S) command permits the selection of the color directly
from the color palette on the display. The set (S) command transfers the
cursor from the 64x64 image to the 16x16 matrix for color selection. When
this mode is entered, it always places the cursor on the current plot color.
To change the plot color in this mode, use the (G) key again. Otherwise, any
other key returns the dot to the 64x64 image without changing the plot color.
The 2x scaling (2) command and the 3x scaling (3) command provide different
views for detailed editing and do not destroy data between mode switches.
The clear (C) command will erase the entire panel (black) in case you wish
to start a new panel from scratch. The ESC key will terminate the program.
It is a good idea to backup your VSWAP.WL6 file before you add "graffiti"
otherwise you will need to reload this file from your program disks if you
want the original artwork.
