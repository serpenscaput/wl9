This packet lets you edit all of the normal datafiles in a wolfenstein- 
or spear of destiny mod, also in mods with code changes.

The packet consists of the following 4 programs that work together:

VSWAPED  edits vswap.*              (wall and sprite images, digital sounds).
VSMAPED  edits gamemaps.*/maptemp.* (level maps).
VSMUSED  edits audiot.*             (PC and AdLib sounds, IMF music).
VSVGAED  edits vgagraph.*           (Fonts, pictures, endscreens, palettes,
                                     demos, endart/texts).

Texts: VSWolfTools.txt and map_descriptions.txt

In all programs you can undo changes and save to the mod with backup.
The program settings are stored, so next time you just click 'open...'.

You can add walls, sprites, digital sounds, IMF music, images,
    endscreens and endart/texts. Except for walls, all additions
    call for recompilation of the exe file.

If you have my old programs wolfenpack, wolfenmap or single VSWAPED
or VSMAPED you may uninstall them and install this packet, possibly
after copying home-made descriptions files.
