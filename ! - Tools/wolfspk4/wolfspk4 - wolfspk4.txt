This EXE file will patch your config file so that Wolf 3D 1 will use 
digitized sound on speaker. My original intent was to make it work with DAC 
so if anyone knows how to do that, please write to me. I got it to think I 
had a Sound Source, but even so it wouldn't give sound. Things like Modplay 
recognize the DAC and work fine. My Internet address is
