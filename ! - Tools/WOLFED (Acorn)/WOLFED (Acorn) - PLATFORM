This program was written and developed on a Risc PC 10M. No one else that 
I know with Acorn equipment has anything other than a Risc PC, so testing 
has been a little difficult.

It definitely works under RO3.5, and there is no reason why it shouldn't 
work under RO3.1x. In theory, if you have the Wimp Borders module, it should
 work completely under RO2.xx as well, but I can't guaruntee it. If anyone 
out there has RO2.xx, and finds that it works or not, I would very much 
appreciate it if you could get in contact with me, and tell me. I might 
be able to fix it so that it does (see the Docs.Legal file).

Unfortunately, this program requires a Hard Disc, due to the size of the 
files that can be produced, ie a patched ASWAP file can get as large as 
1.5Mb long. Many apologies to those of you without a HDD.
