Hi beta-testers!

Here's the last beta of FloEdit. I hope that nearly all bugs are fixed now. There still seems to
be a tricky bug who does not always occur: You might get a crash after you added an image and you
move the scrollbar... If you get the error, immediately make a screenshot of the dialog box, ZIP
and mail it to me and PLEASE ALSO TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO GET THE ERROR (step-by-step).

If you want to add new things to the engine, please read the help chapters "Professional area".
I tell what to do in the engine there to make your new things work!

Lots of little bugs were fixed... I didn't write them down, so I can't give you a complete list
here. I think you'll find out your favourite fixed bugs soon... :-)

Enjoy... (Flo)
