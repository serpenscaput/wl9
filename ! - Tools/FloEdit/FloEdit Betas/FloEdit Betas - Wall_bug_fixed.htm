Hi, I've fixed that terrible bug that caused so much trouble.

The problem was that FloEdit only reserved 4096 bytes for the VSWAP =
header. In the header, there is lenght- and offsetinformation stored for =
every chunk. But in 4096 bytes, there's only space for 682 chunk infos. =
If you added too much walls, there was an overflow: When you reloaded =
the VSWAP, FloEdit interpreted random garbage data as offset- and =
lenght-information: If anyone of you has to deal with software =
development, he can imagine that it will force the program to run beserk =
on it's new "offset" data...

But now, it's fixed. By the way, I added a new error-checking routine. =
If you try to add too much walls (so that the ID would be 106), you'll =
now get the following message:



But ... only 57 walls are used in original wolfenstein I think, so =
there's ENOUGH space for you ;-)

And now, here's the new executable without that terrible bug---

If you still get problems with this executable, tell me

Flo:)
