                 Hey guys,

                 we've got a bad problem: I talked to Robert Prince, the composer of the
                 wolf-music and asked for the source of the MIDI-to-IMF-converter so that I'd
                 be able to write the conversion code IMF->MIDI and MIDI->IMF. But he
                 told me that the converter was writen by a guy who left ID before wolfenstein
                 was released and he doesn't know where this man is today. But I'll try to
                 contact John Romero / ID software and ask them for the converter!

                 Flo:)
