Hi,

some of you already told me that they might get the following error if =
they reconnect to a modified directory:



Sorry for that - the problem is that I'm not able to REPRODUCE this =
error! In my tests, I added 25 walls, sprites and sounds, saved and =
reconnected - without any problems. So if you get this error, try to =
find a way to reproduce it!

Note:
I now know about a new bug:
You might get problems connecting to an original game folder using the =
AutoDetect-option.
I know that and I already fixed this bug now, thank you.
