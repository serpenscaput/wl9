                         Now is the time!
                Download patch1 for beta1!
         This will allow you to CHANGE any
                           VGAGRAPH-
                                objects!

                                  Note:
 Do __NOT__ erase any files from the installed
                                beta1!!!
           The patch only contains a modified
                         FLOEDIT.EXE,
        no runtime-files or BDE. So just unzip
                       FLOEDIT.EXE to
 your beta1-directory and OVERWRITE the old
                         FLOEDIT.EXE.

  !! The code is already able to add/remove gfx
                      from VGAGRAPH,
       but the buttons for this operation are not
                  inserted yet. It is also able
    to change image sizes. But remember, if you
                        change image size,
 you HAVE TO recompile WOLF3D.EXE, or it
                             will crash !!

     Make sure not to change the palette of any
               image, or it will look strange.
  To replace any gfx using correct palette&size,
                           do it like this:
                      - Export gfx to a file
 - Edit the bitmap file with PaintShopPro, Corel
                          Photo-Paint, ...
  - Save the file (256 colors, KEEP ORIGINAL
                             PALETTE)
                - Import the file to the editor
                       - Save your project
