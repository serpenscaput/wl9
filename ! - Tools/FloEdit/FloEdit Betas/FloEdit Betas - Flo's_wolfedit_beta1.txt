BETA 1 available now!

                     ** System requirements **

                    - 486+ CPU (Pentium II would be good)
                            - Windows 95/98/NT4
                             - DirectX 5 or better
       - HiColor or TrueColor display and 1024x786 strongly recommendet
                 - 32 MB RAM (Works with 4 MB too, but...)

                 ** Known bugs  - please do NOT report! **

     - Random garbage in map-window after system came back from standby.
   (I think this is a problem of  DirectX itself rather than a problem of FLOEDIT.
               Restart windows to go on working with the editor!)
    (Please do NOT tell me to use "lpDDSPrimary::IsLost()"
                        function. Doesn't work.)

   - Size of GAMEMAPS file will be larger than GAMEMAPS files produced by
                                 MAPEDIT.
          (And, since MAPEDIT files are larger than original files (simple
                         0xABCD-compression instead
              of "Carmackized" 0xA7A8+0xABCD compression), 
        FLOEDIT's files will also be larger than original wolfenstein files.)
     But they work perfectly with any wolfenstein-version >=1.1 (Spear 1.0)

              Note: You are using this software at your own risk!!!

     Now, click the following link to download BETA_1.EXE (about 3500K).
 This is a self-extracting InstallShield executable (since FLOEDIT requires Borland
                              Database Engine,
           there's no other possibility than installation via InstallShield).
              Sorry for the filesize... I removed anything possible...
