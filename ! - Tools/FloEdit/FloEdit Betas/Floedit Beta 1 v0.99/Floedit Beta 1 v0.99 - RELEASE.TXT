** RELEASE NOTES FOR FLOEDIT 0.99 BETA 1 **
-- Do NOT redistribute this software!!! --

This is  the very  first beta of the FLOEDIT project, so you might
get lots of crashs with this. This version covers:

- Map editing
- Clipboarding
- Export/Import multi-level files
- View VGAGRAPH graphics

I wanted  to include the possibility to REPLACE gfx already in the
first beta,  but the  recompression of the gfx-chunks from a given
huf-dictionary (rather than comressing and creating a new dict) is
much more  complex than  I thought it would be. So this will be in
beta 2,  since I  do not  want to  let you  wait any  more (I will
create up to 3 betas for this project).

When you  work with  the editor,  do NOT  do one  of the following
things since I do not know how FLOEDIT will handle things:

- Copy a map from spear and insert it into WL1/WL6
- Copy a map from WL6 and insert it into WL1

Note: The  editor is  not  yet  capable  of  displaying  "unknown"
objects in the map, so you might get a crash if you do so.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Every memory allocated in the code using "new" is done like this:

try
{
    test=new myobject();
}
catch (std::bad_alloc)
{
    G->Fatal(1, "ERoutine::MakeTest()");
}

So if  Windows is out of memory, the exception will be catched and
the editor will terminate. If you get this, WRITE DOWN __EXACTLY__
what the  "Fatal error"-dialog  box reports,  and mail  it  to  me
(telling the routine that raised the exception).

But all  memory allocated  by Win32's  "GlobalAlloc()"-function is
not yet  error-protected, so  you might  get some  strange crashed
(exception handled by C++ Builder 4 default handler). This handler
does not shut down the application, but I STRONGLY RECOMMEND to do
so!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------

Have fun-

Flo:)
