                 Now I've figured out how to get that crash. I also know the lines who cause
                 the crash. (Sprite renderer code). I think this is a problem of the
                 VSWAP-write routine... I'm working on that. As soon as I fixed the bug, I'll
                 immediately mail a bugfix to you.
