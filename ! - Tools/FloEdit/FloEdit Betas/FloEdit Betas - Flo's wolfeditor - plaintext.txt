Flo's Wolfenstein-Editor
-beta-pageClick here to download newest screenshot (05.08.99)
Here are today's news from the editor (updatet 04.08.99):
I MADE IT !!!! Now, you can extract (and soon CHANGE) any
VGAGRAPH-Bitmaps! Look at some nice images I extracted
from VGAGRAPH.WL1:
** I updated the screenshot... Have a look at it... **

Wolfenstein-Editor beta testers page wysiwyg://146/http://www.wolfenstein.iwarp.com/So, now there are only a few hundered lines of FLOEDIT-sourcecode between me and a
WL1-Version where my picture appears on the status bar instead of BJs picture...
But there is still a problem:
The TITLESCREEN (amount of free memory, sound blaster detected, ...) which contains
the ID-Logo is placed in file SIGNON.OBJ in the \OBJ directory of the sourcecode. It's no
problem for me to write a little bit of code that can change this image to allow you to
create full-customizeable wolf-versions, but if I'd do it this way, you're forced to recompile
wolfenstein to insert the new title screen into the game. I think this is not linked to the
WOLF3D.EXE, but to some other file in a wolf-directory. As soon as I found it
(VSWAP???), I'll write the code that gives you the possibility to change the title screen
without recompiling the project... I Hope this will work...
Features of the editor:
Supports WL1/WL6/SOD, Verision 1.1 or higher (SOD v1.0); WL3, SDM and
gameversion 1.0 are NOT supported directly, but you can import user-defined types
containing as much levels as you like (and your engine supports), so you can also
import WL3 and SDM!

Unlimited undo/redo support
Unlimited multi-clipboard support
Savegame editor wizard
Import/export levels
Manage all your editing projects from one single copy of the editor
Use different symbols for every editing project
Professional mode gives those EXE-hackers full access to the database - useful for
adding new walls/objects/monsters
Auto-floor-inserter: Don't worry about those floor commands - when you've finished
your level, click on the "Auto fill" toolbar button, and the editor automatically inserts
another floor command in every room you've created!
Well, now you all know how the editor looks like. And if you look at the screenshot, you'll
ask: "What is an 'Objecttype' ?". So I'll explain. Whenever you connect to a wolf/spear
directory, the 'Objecttypes' page will be activated automatically. Then you can chose to
take the standard-type "Wolfenstein Shareware", "Wolfenstein full version" or "Spear Of
Destiny". Or you can select a user-defined Objecttype or create a new one. If you only
modify maps, you won't need to create any own Objecttypes. Objecttypes manage the
symbols that are used by the editor to represent map/object items. So when you modify a
version of Wolfenstein where you want YOUR picture instead of the standard picture of
Adolf Hitler appearing on the grey brick, you do it like this:
Define a new objecttype
Name it to "Wolfenstein full with me"
Replace the grey symbol with the yellow point in it with a blue symbol with a purple
point in it (or any other symbol)
Change the symbol description to "Grey brick / me"

That's all. When you reconnect to any wolf/spear folder then, you can decide if you are
editing the normal version with the normal symbol, or if you're editing the new version
with the new symbol.
When you copy clipboard objects from one wolf-version to another, the clipboard object
previews will be rerendered automatically to represent the new symbol table.
There's also a professional mode in the editor: If you're one of those guys who not only
change maps/sounds/grafx but also recompile the exe-file to insert new
wall/objects/guards, you can use the professional mode to insert new IDs to the databases
(the editor supports 500 walls and 500 objects)...
(Since "int" is a 32-bit signed value in Borland C++ Builder 4, you can create more than
2,000,000,000 different Objecttypes. I think that's enough for everybody...)
This won't be the final page where end-users can download WOLFEDIT,
just for beta-phase...
