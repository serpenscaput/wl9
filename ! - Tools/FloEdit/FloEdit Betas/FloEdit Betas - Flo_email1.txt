                 Hey guys,

                 hope you all have fun with editor? Does anyone of you know of any tool that
                 EDITS wolf-music? It would not be so complicated to write the import/export
                 function (AUDIOT/AUDIOHED are not compressed), but the problem is to PLAY the
                 music. Well, I haven't looked at music-part of the wolf-source so deep
                 already, but I think they use FM-synthesis to play the sounds rather that
                 small digitized chunks like MOD uses.... Does anyone know anything about? If
                 you use a hex-editor and browse through AUDIOT-file (at the end, because
                 PC-speaker sounds and AdLib-effects are stored at the beginning), you'll
                 often find the file-extension "IMF" for the music
                 ("ID-soft-Music-Format ????) .

                 By the way, have I told you yet? A thing that FloEdit will definitely NOT
                 support is changing the FONTs of wolfenstein, since I do not think that
                 anyone needs to modify that.

                 ....you all like my very cool demo-map of level 1 ??? yeah, but I recommend
                 that you'll do a better job in your add-ons... ;-)

                 Flo:)
