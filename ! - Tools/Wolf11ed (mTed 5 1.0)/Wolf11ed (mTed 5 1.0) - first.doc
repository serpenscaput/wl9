*** First ***

A handy little utility for Wolf3D v1.1 (registered episodes 1-6)

usage:

first <epsiode> <level>

what it does:
makes the level on the command line first.

so typing
FIRST 3 5

makes the first level in epsiode 5, level 3 and the third, level 1.
(thus typing first 3 5 will reverse the change)

** WARNING ** - its easy to get confused using this program and it alters
                the files MAPHEAD.WL6 and GAMEMAPS.WL6
        MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP OF THESE FILES IN CASE THEY GET
        SCREWED UP
