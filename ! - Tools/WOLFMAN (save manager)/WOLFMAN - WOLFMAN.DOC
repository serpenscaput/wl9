  INTRODUCTION
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  I'll try to make this short and sweet. In case you haven't discovered,
  Wolfenstein 3-D saves games in a series of files named SAVEGAMx.WL1
  where the 'x' is a digit from 0 to 9, corresponding to the position
  you have selected on the save game list. 

  Use WOLFMAN.EXE to modify the saved game files to suit your own taste.
  How about 99 lives? Maybe you'd like a 200% health rating. Wish you
  could have more than 99 rounds of ammo at one time? Shatter the old
  mark by choosing up to 200 rounds!


  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  RUNNING THE PROGRAM
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Decide which of your saved game files you'd like to modify, or create
  a new one. Then load WOLFMAN by typing:

                         WOLFMAN [Drive/Path/File]

  where [Drive/Path/File] is the location and file name of the saved game
  you want to change (be sure and include the .WL1 file extension).

  WOLFMAN will display the file name, the name you gave it, the skill
  level selected and the size of the file in bytes.


  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHANGING YOUR GAME PARAMETERS
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Use the  and  keys to adjust the values for the following:

                     Lives    (range 1 to 99)
                     Health   (range 1 to 200)
                     Ammo     (range 1 to 200)

                     Weapon   (your choice of four)
                     Keys     (none/gold/silver/both)

  Caveats: if you exceed the "game standard limits" of 100% HEALTH or 99
  rounds of AMMO, the status display at the bottom of your play screen
  will be disrupted due to the way Wolfenstein 3-D handles the graphic
  display of B.J. Blazkowicz's facial expressions. THE GAME WILL PLAY
  NORMALLY, REGARDLESS. Also, if you exceed 99 rounds of AMMO and pick up
  another clip of bullets, Wolfenstein 3-D will adjust your level to 99.
  The same goes for HEALTH--if you select health above 100% and step on
  a first aid kit, your health will max out at 100%--so watch your step!

  Press ENTER when you are happy with your selection. You can use the
  ESC key to abort the changes.
