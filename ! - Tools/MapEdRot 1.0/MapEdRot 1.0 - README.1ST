Welcome to MapEdRot (Map Editor for Rise of the Triad)! This editor
comes to you from the same people who brought you MAPEDIT, the
editor for Wolf3D, Spear of Destiny and related games.

Unlike other editors of this genre, MapEdRot operates exclusively
under DOS, but uses 32-bit processing for speed.  If you can play Rise
of the Triad on your computer, then MapEdRot should work for you.

Features:

 Multiple Screen resolution
 All 100 levels available for editing.
 Level copying, exchanging.
 Level Exporting/Importing
 Online stats
 Viewable WAD graphics.
 Extensive online help.
 Entire level viewable on one screen.
 197 levels of zooming
 Much more...

           ******* Installation Instructions *******
                 ****************************
MapEdRot has been setup to operate from a sub-directory of Rise of The Triad.
We recommend that you create a sub-directory named MAPEDROT and unzip the
files in PROGRAM.ZIP into it.  That is all you will have to do.  If
you don't install it into a sub-directory of ROTT you will have to change
the "Game path" parameter in the "Pref" menu.  Once you have changed this
you should save it by selecting "Save Pref" also in the "Pref" menu.

<<NOTE:>>
  MapEdRot requires a VESA compliant video board.  If you experience
problems displaying any of the different resolutions (640x480, 800x600,
1024x768) check the drivers that came with your video board.  There
may be a TSR VESA driver.  If you don't have one we recommend that you
obtain the UNIVBE VESA driver which can be found on Compuserve and you
can also obtain it at an FTP site:  FTP://FTP.SCITECH.COM/UVBE51A.ZIP.

<<NOTE:>>
  MAPEDROT will ONLY execute in a pure DOS environment.  It will
NOT operate from within Windows, including WINDOWS 95.  Exception:  If
you select SHUTDOWN in Win95 and elect to "Restart the Computer in
MS-DOS mode", MapEdRot will operate in this manner.  We are using a
freeware DOS extender.  There is a new version expected soon that will
support running in Windows 3.x and Windows 95.
