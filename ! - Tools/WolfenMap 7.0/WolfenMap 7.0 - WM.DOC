WolfenMap v7.0 - Wolfenstein Map Editor            (c) 1941 Lothar Vollbehr


Please register your copies of Wolfenstein 3D with Apogee Software.  It is
assumed that owners of "Spear of Destiny" have purchased their software
from FormGen.

    About CARDWARE:

    Recently, I became aware of the CARDWARE concept from a game I down-
    loaded from my regular BBS.  Here's the deal:  If you enjoyed these
    new levels (even just a little) I would appreciate it if you would
    send a postcard (a local scene would be nice) to the address below.
    Please mention how you obtained WolfenMap and any comments.  It will be
    interesting to see just how far and wide a BBS file travels.

NEW FEATURES:

WolfenMap is similar to MapEdit except it greatly reduces map development
time through the following enhancements:

  - Flood an entire map with a user-selected wall.  (It's much quicker to
    cut floors into a solid wall than it is to draw walls around a floor.)

  - Instantly add blocks of walls, floors or objects. Block sizes are user
    selectable from 2x2 to 9x9.  (This eases the tediousness of correcting
    mouse mistakes.)

  - Can edit maps for 'Spear of Destiny' and 'Wolfenstein 3D.'

  - Extract a floor from an episode.

  - Include an extracted floor into an episode. 

  - Live statistics showing current number of actors and objects.  The data
    is displayed in red when a limit is exceeded.

USAGE:

Create a new subdirectory and re-install the game you wish to edit.  This
will allow you to rollback to your original game, in the event of errors.
To use WolfenMap, copy the files from the WolfenMap floppy into the directory
where your game is installed.  Type: WM70 to start the editor.


KEY FUNCTIONS:

     up & down arrows - select level to view or edit.
     Q - Quit (you will be prompted to save).
     C - Clear level (grey brick around the outside of an empty level).
     O - Toggle object display.
     F - Toggle floor display.
     T - Flood an entire level with the last chosen wall, floor or object.
     S - Toggle display a count of things, actors, static objects and the
         onscreen help..  Be aware that each games has different limits and
         experimentation may be required to determine limits.
     2 through 9 - Instantly paste the current wall, floor or object in
         block fashion by positioning the mouse at the top left corner of
         the block, then pressing a number key.
     R - Read SINGLE.FLR
     W - Write SINGLE.FLR


MAP WINDOW:

Whenever the mouse is in the map window, the map and object data for the
selected square will be displayed beneath the window.  Clicking the mouse
will change either the map or object data to the currently selected item.


LEGEND WINDOW:

The window on the right side of the screen displays the map/object legend.
Clicking on UP/DOWN scrolls through the list.  Clicking on MAP/OBJ switches
between the map and object lists.  Clicking on an item in the list makes
it the "current" item.

After each guard, there is a 3 character description which specifies what
level the guard is, whether they are moving or stationary, and which
direction they are facing/walking.  For example, "1/S/E" meansa level 1
guard, stationary, facing east.


*.DAT FILES:

 WALLS1.DAT  = Walls for the single episode version of Wolfenstein 3D
 THINGS1.DAT = Actors and objects for the single episode Wolfenstein 3D
 WALLS.DAT   = Walls for the six episode version of Wolfenstein 3D
 THINGS.DAT  = Actors and objects for the six episode version of Wolfenstein
 WALLSOD.DAT = Walls for Spear of Destiny
 THINGSOD.DAT= Actors and objects for Spear of Destiny

There is no problem created by installing all of the *.DAT files into the
directory with any of the editable games.  WolfenMap is smart enough to
know which .DAT to use.

If you figure out a new object or desire to customize WolfenMap, you can
add or change it's description to the object/map list by editing the
appropriate DAT file.

Each line in the file contains 3 items:

0000 0000 Objectname

The first four digits are HEX for the object number.  Right now, even
though there are 4 digits, you can only put objects from 0000-01ff in.

The second four digits define how the object will look in the map.
The first two digits are the primary/secondary colors.  The third
digit is the graphic type, and the fourth digit is the character
string to use if the graphic type is "text".

Colors:
   0 - black
   1 - blue
   2 - green
   3 - cyan
   4 - red
   5 - magenta
   6 - brown
   7 - light grey
   8 - dark grey
   9 - light blue
   a - light green
   b - light cyan
   c - light red
   d - light magenta
   e - yellow
   f - white

Graphic types:

   0 - text (uses fourth character of graphic definition)
   1 - solid box
   2 - checkered
   3 - solid box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   4 - checkered box (primary) with decoration (secondary)
   5 - large filled circle (primary) with smaller circle (secondary)
   6 - horizontal bar
   7 - vertical bar
   8 - two color box (used for landscape view)
   9 - single pixel centered 
   a - 3x3 pixel block
   b - 3x5 pixel block
   c - 
   d - X (primary)
   e - rectangle
   f - arrow  (secondary color indicates direction: 0=n,1=ne,2=e,3=se,
                                                    4=s,5=sw,6=w,7=nw)

HINTS:

   An episode consisting of favorite floors from various episodes could
be created through the use of the READ and WRITE functions.

   It is much faster to create a new level by first flooding a blank floor
with a particular wall.  Then use various sized blocks of floor to "cut" rooms
into the walls.

   Be sure that all "actors" within a room can "see" the door.  That is,
they must face towards the door in a general fashion.  Failure to do so
seems to cause the game to lockup.

   Placing an "actor" with his nose right against a wall will cause the
game to lockup.

   By placing "actors" on the Deaf Guard type of floor, they will stay in
a room until the door is opened.

   If you use the "standing" type of actors and place one of them near the
door on the inside of a room, the actors will wander out of the room and
head in you general direction after a shot is fired.

   Pay attention to the statistical display.  If a limit of actors or objects
is exceeded, the game produces an error at runtime.

   Elevator doors should face East of West.  The game doesn't seem to handle
elevator doors facing North or South.

   The game doesn't seem to interpret the different types of floors.  I
generally use Purple for the public areas, black with a grey dot for the
areas behind a secret door and green to draw a path from the starting point
to the elevator.  This makes it easy to find your way through a level when
revisiting it later.  It also helps you avoid creating a level that has an
unreachable elevator.

   The secret door token can be used many ways.  For example: a key can be
placed in a small vacant area behind a secret panel.  When the wall is pushed,
the key comes into view.  Also: secret panels can be stacked, thus the wall
can be move more than the normal three steps.  Clustering secret panels can
create an interesting effect, too.

   If dogs are used without the Turning Points, they will roam around and
hunt down the player.  If Turning Points are used with the dogs, be careful
you don't create a puppy shooting gallery.

   Guards can be made to "walk out of a wall" by placing two Turning Points
which face each other inside a wall and an actor facing into the Turning
Points.  EX:  -><-G (G/S/W).  The player can also step into one of these
alcoves and become invisible to the guards.

   Guards can shoot through the corners of rooms with adjacent corners.

   The game will support multiple Bosses on one level.

   In version 1.0 (shareware, 10 levels), an interesting effect can be created
by placing a stationary Guard on a Deaf Guard floor space with his nose against
the inside of a door.  The door becomes invisible!

   Be careful that you don't use tokens from one game in a game that they are
not part of.  That is, don't use a Spear of Destiny token in a Wolfenstein
map.  When the player approaches this token, the screen will freeze.
WolfenMap is smart (to a certain degree) enough to help you by chosing the
appropriate .DAT files.  The best bet is to use different subdirectories for
different games.
