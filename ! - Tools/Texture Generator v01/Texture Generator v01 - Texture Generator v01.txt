"Tricob's Texture Generator"

Howdy, folks.  It's Tricob again, as you might have guessed.  :-)

I designed this program to decrease the time it would take to make professional-looking 
textures for my games.  The program is DOS-based, and doesn't run in Windows 7 or 
Windows Vista, unless you use the DOS Box program.  If you can getting the code running 
in QB64 or FreeBASIC, please do so, and forward the source code and EXE to me.  Thanks! 
 :-)

To use this program, save a 320x200 pic from your mod into a BMP file, and call it 
"1.BMP".  Then place the file in the same folder as this program.  Now run the program.


The source code I provide is for QuickBASIC v4.5, another DOS-based program.  The 
BMP Save/Load code was written by an outside QB user many years back.

Hope this utility proves useful to you.  :-)
