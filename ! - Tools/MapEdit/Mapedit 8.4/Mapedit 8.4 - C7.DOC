        Introduction

        Corridor 7 is the 4th in a series of first person, 3-D games that
        uses an engine licensed from id Software. The first 3 in the order
        of their appearance are Wolfenstein 3-D (tm), Spear of Destiny
        (tm), and Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold (tm). Spear of Destiny used
        the same engine as Wolf3D. Blake Stone introduced a number of
        changes to support new features that were not present in its
        predecessors through the use of significant engine modifications.

        Corridor 7 introduces other new features but only one is like any
        in Blake Stone. For the most part, Corridor 7 operates more like
        Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny than Blake Stone. Virtually all of the
        changes to the engine of Corridor 7 affect walls and doors, the use
        of "animated" objects, as well as an ability to "see" through
        certain types of walls and doors.

        As far as creating floors for Corridor 7 is concerned, the approach
        does not differ much from creating floors for Wolf3D, Spear of
        Destiny, or Blake Stone. If you have never created a floor for any
        of these games before, it is recommended that you read through
        "Tips for Creating/Editing Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny Designs".
        This document is included in the Mapedit package. The above
        document will give you a flavor for what is involved.

        Game Map Structure

        Corridor 7 (both the diskette version and the CD-ROM version) are
        structured differently from their predecessors even though the same
        data is required by the engine in order for the game to operate.

        All games using the id Software engine require a pair of files that
        contain the maps of all the levels being played as well as
        "pointer" data to these levels. Prior to Corridor 7, the "pointer"
        data is contained in a separate file named MAPHEAD. In Corridor 7,
        this file does not exist, per se. Instead, the data which would
        normally be in this file has been integrated into the Corridor 7
        program itself. The game maps still exist in a separate file named
        MAPTEMP.CO7.

        The point of all this is to remind you that when you prepare some
        new floors for Corridor 7 and you want to make them available to
        others, you MUST NOT ship a copy of the Corridor 7 program. This
        would violate the copyright of Corridor 7.

        In order to distribute your new floors, a special utility program
        is available to export a special "map group" file that can be





                                      -4-
        
        distributed. The recipient will then be required to use a copy of
        the same utility to import (merge) the map data into his own copy
        of the C7 program. This method of distribution ensures that no one
        except a registered user of Corridor 7 can use the floors. More on
        the utility program later.

        Corridor 7 (disk) vs. Corridor 7 (CD-ROM)

        While the first 30 levels, plus 6 bonus levels, of the CD-ROM
        version of the game appear to be nearly identical to the same
        levels in the disk version of the game, they are in fact
        incompatible with one another. As a result, when you create new
        floors for one of the games, they will NOT be playable with the
        other version of the game.

        DATA DEFINITION FILES

        MAPEDIT provides data definition files for all games it supports.
        In the case of Corridor 7, there are separate versions for Disk and
        CD-ROM versions. See the README file for instructions on how to
        select the proper data definition files.

        There are a significant number of codes/symbols identified in the
        MAPDATA definition file that represent walls/doors that were not
        used in the official game. Any description that simply says (unused
        wall) is one of these walls/doors. To see what these walls/doors
        look like, you will have to insert them in a floor and start the
        game to view them.

        Of the remaining walls/doors, the descriptions that appear in the
        MAPEDIT legend window are mostly too long to fit in the limited
        space so you must scroll the legend window horizontally to read the
        entire description. The descriptions are lengthy due to the complex
        graphic designs, especially (but certainly not limited to) the
        alien walls.

        You are also reminded that you are free to edit the definition
        files since they are in Ascii format. However, it is not advisable
        to re-order the file. Even though the actual game does not depend
        on this file, you will find it easier to edit floors if you leave
        it in its present order.












                                      -5-
        
        New Features in Corridor 7

        To those of you who have played previous 3-D games, the most
        obvious new feature that is immediately apparent in Corridor 7 is
        the use of "glass" walls through which one can clearly see what is
        on the other side. This "see-through" feature is extended to
        certain types of doors as well as other wall types that partition
        off the floor space. Note: Aliens cannot see through any type of
        wall. If they can be seen moving rapidly about on the other side of
        a "see-thru" wall, it is because they have shifted to Attack Mode
        for some reason not related to the "see-through" feature.

        Another interesting feature is that there is a great deal of
        movement - or animation - present. Many of the wall graphics are in
        constant motion. This tends to make the environment seem more alive
        than previous games of the same genre. Much of the movement is
        inherent and controlled by the engine. Some of it needs to be
        overtly triggered by the floor designer with the use of certain
        triggering object codes. A set of triggering object codes is also
        used to activate the "see-through" feature mentioned in the
        previous paragraph.

        Corridor 7 Design Limitations

        In the disk version of Corridor 7, the game ends by destroying the
        VORTEX. Hence, the VORTEX must appear in the 30th level only.

        In the CD-ROM version of the game, the VORTEX can be destroyed
        either on the 30th level or the final level and this will end the
        game. The VORTEX on the 30th level can also be "entered" by the
        Space Marine and he will be transported to the 31st level. It can
        also be entered on the final level, which will end the game and
        start the final cinematic sequences.

        Bonus levels are entered from levels 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 only.
        In the original game, the bonus levels are entered from elevators
        that have a special floor code. These elevators are usually hidden,
        and/or protected by increasingly tougher "bosses".

        Certain alien creatures do not exist outside of an alien
        environment, notably the "Alioprobes", in the original game. There
        is no restriction other than the spirit of the game that keeps them
        from being used in an earth type environment.

        Corridor 7 Design Considerations

        Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny are prison and castle environments. As
        such, the use of narrow corridors is in keeping with the spirit of
        the game (although many wide halls and corridors were used too).
        Hidden rooms entered through pushwalls contained treasure and
        caches of ammo and weapons, but sometimes pushwalls were used as


                                      -6-
        
        shortcuts to other areas.

        Blake Stone occurs in a futuristic sci-fi environment. While there
        were many alien type creatures created by Dr. Goldfire, there were
        also humans. The floor designs were not generally dungeon-like in
        appearance. Hidden rooms were used in virtually the same manner as
        in Wolf3d and SoD.

        Corridor 7 suggests an entirely different environment: a modern
        office and lab complex on earth which is being methodically
        converted to an out-of-world environment suitable for supporting
        the alien life that is occupying it. Aside from our Space Marine,
        there are no other live humans. Narrow halls are the exception
        rather than the rule. The major exception to this is the outer
        maintenance corridor which exists on most levels (except the new
        alien levels in the CD-ROM version) and is entered through a push
        wall.

        Hidden Areas, Push Walls & Bonus Scoring

        Corridor 7 contains no treasure (earthly treasure is apparently of
        no value to the occupying aliens). Hidden areas normally contain
        weapons, armor, invincibility spheres, proximity maps, and other
        devices helpful to the survival of the Space Marine. Hidden areas
        that contain these items are considered restricted areas and as
        such affect the bonus scoring. However, entering a maintenance
        corridor through a push wall is not normally considered to be
        entering a restricted area. To differentiate between a restricted
        area and a non-restricted area, there are two types of "push-wall"
        codes. If object code '62' is used to mark a pushwall, then the
        area behind it is considered restricted. If object code '65' is
        used to mark a pushwall, then the area behind it is considered
        unrestricted.

        To achieve 100% access to all restricted areas, all pushwalls
        identified with object code '62' must be located and pushed open.
        Any pushwalls identified with object code '65' do not figure into
        the bonus scoring.

        Special Floor Code & The Automap

        All floors have areas located behind secret doors (pushwalls). Such
        areas do not display on the game's Automap. The key to hiding any
        area you don't want displayed on the Automap is to use floor code
        '008F' (disk version) or floor code '0103' (CD version).








                                      -7-
        
        Locked Doors

        Virtually every floor in Corridor 7 that is not an alien floor,
        contains locked doors. To open these doors, a blue or red access
        "card" must be obtained. In every case, access is granted when an
        appropriate Access Security Terminal is located. Most often, one or
        both of the Terminals are located in a "Security Office". They are
        usually mixed in with one or more "Access Intrusion Terminals",
        which, if accidently or mistakenly activated, will alert any nearby
        aliens.

        In most cases, there are also Access Security Terminals located
        just inside the door that is locked. This is so if the Space Marine
        finds an alternate access to the room/area via a pushwall
        somewhere, he can obtain the right access card to unlock the door
        and leave the area.

        Special Trigger Codes

        As indicated above, Corridor 7 uses special object codes to cause
        certain walls/doors to appear animated or to be able to see through
        different wall and door types. These are listed below together with
        where and how each code is used.

        Object
        Code     Description
        ----     -----------
        0056     Slow Speed Animation
        0057     Normal Speed Animation
        0058     High Speed Animation
        0067     Sliding Door "see thru" and open/close activator
        0068     Glass "see thru" activator
        0069     Wall "see thru" activator (incl. fences)
        006a     Non-sliding door activator with "see thru"
        006b     No Clipping activated for single map cell

        The above codes are inserted in the same cell on the map as the
        wall/door that is to be activated.

        Animation Error Code

        There is a limit to the number of some Animation object codes that
        can be used in one level. Codes 56-58, 6a, and 6b in the above list
        are the "animation" codes and their combined use cannot exceed 32.
        The Map code '0055' (Medic Pack) also figures into the total count.
        If you exceed the count, the Stat labeled "Total Animates" in the
        lower right corner of the Mapedit screen will turn red to warn you.
        If you ignore the warning and play the game, as soon as the level
        is being loaded into memory, the game will abort and issue a
        message "32+ Sliding Walls".



                                      -8-
        
        How Animation Works

        Animation is implemented in the following way. During play, when
        the game detects any wall type with an Animation code on it, the
        program displays the wall represented by that code and the
        following 3 wall codes in sequence, then continues to cycle through
        the 4 codes. This causes the wall graphic to be animated. Any one
        of the 4 wall types used in the animation sequence could be used by
        itself without an Animation code, thus eliminating any movement.

        Animation speed is determined by which animation code (56 thru 58)
        you select. Choose the one you think gives the effect you desire.

        Once again, you are reminded that you can edit the data definition
        files. However, you are advised not to change the order.

        Non-Sliding Doors

        Many different types of doors are used in Corridor 7. The
        conventional doors slide left or right when opening. Such doors
        require no special triggering to make them operate. (You are
        limited to 63 of these kinds of doors). However, there are a number
        of other types of "doors" that open in unconventional ways. Some
        open by moving upwards (Health Chamber, Medic Pack); others open
        from the inside out (most alien entrances and elevator doors);
        still others open by the removal of a force field (Security
        Offices).

        Because unconventional doors cannot be handled the same as the
        sliding doors, the animation effect must be applied so that four
        separate door codes are cycled through one time to see the door
        open and in reverse to see the door close. Object code '6a' is used
        for this purpose. It is inserted on the map in the same cell as the
        door that is to be operated.

        If you want to have one of these doors in the open position and not
        allow it to be closed, then choose the fully opened door code for
        the door type you want and then use object code '6b' so that the
        door can be walked through. Code '6b' does 2 things. It makes a
        wall or door appear as a thin partition and then applies "no
        clipping" logic so that it can be walked through.

        To help you determine which doors/walls can be animated, the
        Mapdata legend window in Mapedit will provide 2 additional pieces
        of information. 1) Any wall type that can be animated will have a
        small letter 'a' in parenthesis at the beginning of the
        description. At the end of the description will be the trigger
        object code(s) that you can choose from. 2) Any door type that
        needs a trigger code will have that code displayed at the end of
        the description.



                                      -9-
        
        NOTE: A large letter 'A' in parenthesis at the start of the
        description field means the symbol represents something normally
        used only in an alien environment.

        Teleporters

        Another interesting feature of Corridor 7 is the introduction of
        Teleporters (only in the CD-ROM version). While teleporters also
        exist in Blake Stone, only Blake can use them. In Corridor 7,
        aliens can use them as well. There is no special action required to
        use them - just walk into one and be teleported to some
        destination.

        Teleporter destinations are determined by the use of 1 of 8 special
        floor codes (117 through 11e). Floor code '11f' denotes the use of
        a teleporter that takes you to the next level (there are no
        elevators used in the 10 new Alien levels of the CD-ROM version of
        Corridor 7).

        NOTE: Teleporters are objects and as such have object codes used to
        insert them on the map where you want them, but they are not
        operable unless they are placed on one of the 8 teleporter floor
        codes. You can have a maximum of 8 teleporters per level.

        As stated above, teleporters can and are used by aliens. This
        produces an interesting effect depending on how the regular floor
        codes are laid out. If the Space Marine fires his weapon while
        standing on any particular code, all aliens on the same floor code
        will shift to Attack mode and move towards the Space Marine. This
        produces the singular effect of having aliens seemingly coming out
        of the woodwork from all directions, homing in on their target as
        some of them move through teleporters.

        A New CD-ROM Alien

        The CD-ROM version of Corridor 7 introduces some new aliens. The
        game's User Guide names and describes all aliens but one. It
        appears in several of the new levels. It is a small creature that
        jumps high in the air and emits a piercing scream when killed. He
        is more of an annoyance than a real threat, but he dies in an
        amusing way. This alien was supposed to have been removed from the
        game before it was released, but somehow it was overlooked and
        hence wasn't given a name. You will find that it has a name in the
        object data legend window. In keeping with the use of names spelled
        backwards for many of the aliens, I have chosen to name this small
        creature NERRAW.







                                     -10-
        
        NETWORK Levels

        The CD-ROM version of the game introduces Networking and Deathmatch
        play. There are 8 levels designed for this purpose. They are levels
        51 through 58. They have large open areas and lots of available
        ammo, weapons, health items, etc. Walls/doors and objects that were
        used only in the Network levels are marked with an 'NT' in the
        description fields. There are no Proximity Maps provided for these
        levels as this would provide the players with an unfair advantage.

        There are also no aliens in these levels. The player is given a
        choice of being a Space Marine or an Alien when playing. Just
        remember that if you choose an Alien, some of them move more slowly
        than others and are no match for a Space Marine, but alien against
        like-alien would be an interesting match.

        While starting locations are in each Network level, the game will
        assign random starting locations for each player at the start of
        the game.

        Debugging Your Levels

        A number of debugging or "cheat" codes are available when you want
        to test a floor you have created or changed. To enter debugging
        mode you must start the game in the following manner:

        CORR7 level1diagnostic

        There are no spaces in the word "level1diagnostic". You may provide
        other parameters along with this one if you want. The above
        parameter does not have to be the first one in the list.

        Distributing Game Levels

        As mentioned earlier, a new utility for use only with Corridor 7
        has been added to the Mapedit package. This utility is named
        C7_UTIL.EXE. It's purpose is to create and export a file to disk
        that contains all the floors that comprise the current game (CD-ROM
        or Disk version) prior to distributing them. It also must be used
        to import a file into an existing game.

        It doesn't matter where you store C7_UTIL. By default, it expects
        to find the game files in the current directory, as well as the map
        group files. But these defaults can be overridden after you start
        C7_UTIL. (A "map group" consists of an entire set of maps for all
        levels as well as the data that points to each level).

        There is one important safety feature built into the utility. When
        you wish to Import a map group, by default, a backup file will be
        created of the current game map files before the Importing takes
        place. You can elect to override this feature and you can also
        select a name of your choice for the backup file.

        The first time you start C7_UTIL a menu of 4 optional items - A, B,
        E, and F - will appear on the screen. Item A, by default, is
        Export. Item B is the file name for the file to be Exported. The
        default name for this file also displays and may be altered by
        selecting item B.

        Item E can be selected to tell C7_UTIL the full name of the game
        path. By default, it is the current directory. If you want to store
        the floor files somewhere other than the current directory, select
        option F. To start the Export operation, select the G option (GO).
        Any time you need help press F1. Press Q to quit. You will be asked
        if you want to save any changes you made to any of the options.
        Reply 'Y' or 'N' and press Enter. NOTE: If this is the first time
        you have run C7_UTIL and you modified any pathnames, be sure to
        save the changes when you quit so you won't have to repeat them
        next time.

        If you selected item A to change to an IMPORT operation, then you
        will see 2 additional options displayed (C and D). Option C lets
        you elect to say you want a backup file of the current game files
        created before the Import takes place, or not. The default is to
        create the backup file. If you want a backup file, then option D
        lets you choose a name other than the name currently displayed on
        the screen. NOTE: C7_UTIL checks to see if the maps you are
        importing match your game (CD or Diskette) and aborts if they don't
        match.

        Lastly, if you are distributing game groups to someone else, try to
        determine if they have the C7_UTIL program. If you can't determine
        it or you know they don't have it, then ship a copy of C7_UTIL with
        your distribution package. You may want to ship a copy of these
        instructions too.
