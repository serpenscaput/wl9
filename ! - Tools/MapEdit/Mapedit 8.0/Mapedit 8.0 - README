Welcome to the newest version of MAPEDIT! For those of you who've
used MAPEDIT in the past, a great deal has changed, including some
of the keys you used. This was done to accomodate the addition of
some of the many new features that are now part of MAPEDIT. Page 17
of MAPEDIT.DOC will give you a quick glance at what is new and what
has changed. You are urged to at least look at the Table of Contents
of MAPEDIT.DOC to familiarize yourself with what is in the document.

If you want to create new floors for Blake Stone, you need to read
BSTONE.DOC to get acquainted with all the new features that are
in Blake Stone. You'll also want to read the section in MAPEDIT.DOC
that explains how the Blake Stone features are implemented.

To print the documents, use the DOS COPY command to PRN or LPT1. All
documents contain imbedded form-feeds, so the pages won't run
together.

You should take a look at the MANIFEST file to get a quick briefing
on what each file in the package is and does.

Please be advised that Version 8.0 will not edit shareware versions
of any of the games it supports. If you experience any problems with
either MAPEDIT or any of the floors you create with it, contact one
of the authors. DO NOT CONTACT Apogee Software. We thank you for your
cooperation in this matter.

As users of MAPEDIT, your opinions and suggestions would be most welcome!
We think we've made a lot of useful improvements to MAPEDIT. But we're
sure that as you get better acquainted with MAPEDIT you will have some
great ideas for improving the product. We would like to encourage you to
submit your ideas and suggestions to any one of the authors listed below.
We will make every effort to respond to each person who takes the time to
write.

Thank you.
