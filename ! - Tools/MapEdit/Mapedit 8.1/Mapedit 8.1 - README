Welcome to the newest version of MAPEDIT! To find out what is new
in Version 8.1, view the file "WHATS.NEW".

If the MAPEDIT package contains an ADDENDUM.DOC file, be sure to
read it for descriptions of any changes to MAPEDIT or the
documentation since the last update distribution. If there is no
ADDENDUM.DOC file, then changes and additions to the documentation
since the last version are flagged with a vertical bar (|) in the
left margin.

If you want to create new floors for Blake Stone, you need to read
BSTONE.DOC to get acquainted with all the new features that are
in Blake Stone. You'll also want to read the section in MAPEDIT.DOC
that explains how the Blake Stone features are implemented.

To print the documents, use the DOS COPY command to PRN or LPT1. All
documents (except ADDENDUM.DOC) contain imbedded form-feeds, so the
pages won't run together.

You should take a look at the MANIFEST file to get a quick briefing
on what each file in the package is and does.

Please be advised that Version 8.1 will not edit shareware versions
of any of the games it supports. If you experience any problems with
either MAPEDIT or any of the floors you create with it, contact one
of the authors. DO NOT CONTACT Apogee Software. We thank you for your
cooperation in this matter.

As users of MAPEDIT, your opinions and suggestions would be most welcome!
We think we've made a lot of useful improvements to MAPEDIT. But we're
sure that as you get better acquainted with MAPEDIT you will have some
great ideas for improving the product. We would like to encourage you to
submit your ideas and suggestions to any one of the authors listed below.
We will make every effort to respond to each person who takes the time to
write.

Thank you.
