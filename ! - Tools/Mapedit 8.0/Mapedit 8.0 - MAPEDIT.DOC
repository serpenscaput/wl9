       The Map Editor supports ONLY registered games of Wolfenstein(tm),
       Spear of Destiny(tm) and Blake Stone(tm). It will neither read nor
       write game maps intended for use with a shareware game. If you have
       problems with any floors produced using MAPEDIT, do NOT contact
       either Apogee Software's Technical Support or Hints staff,  Id
       Software, FormGen Corp., or JAM Productions. They are not
       responsible for this editor or its products. Nor do they support
       them. Please contact one of the authors if you have problems with
       MAPEDIT.

       Also, if you produce floors that you place in the public domain, be
       sure they carry a notice that users should not contact any of the
       above named companies for help.

       It is not unusual for a "home-grown" floor design to cause problems
       when it is part of a game. That is, a game engine may produce one
       or more error messages if it finds something in the floor that it
       doesn't like. Most messages from any of these games urge the player
       to contact one of the above companies and report the problem.
       IGNORE all such messages and contact one of the authors of MAPEDIT
       if you receive any of these error messages.

       To avoid most problems, test all your floor designs thoroughly at
       all skill levels. If possible, have a friend test them also if you
       intend to release your designs into the public domain.

       Your cooperation is essential for continued support and
       availability of MAPEDIT. Thank you.

                       WOLF3D and SOD Versus BLAKE STONE

       Blake Stone maps contain a number of unique features that do not
       exist in either WOLF3D or Spear of Destiny. These features are
       supported by MAPEDIT for Blake Stone only and are thus unavailable
       when a WOLF3D or SoD game is being edited. The functions of the
       editor that support the unique features of Blake Stone are
       explained separately in this document. WOLF3D and SoD designers
       need not read the Blake Stone section. See the companion document
       BSTONE.DOC for explanations of what the Blake Stone features are.

       To use MapEdit, place all MAPEDIT associated files (see the
       MANIFEST file) in the same directory as the game you want to edit.
       Type MAPEDIT to start the editor.

       A swap directory is required for temporary use during execution of
       MAPEDIT. MAPEDIT will prompt you for a drive letter on which to
       place this directory. Either an uncompressed drive that is being
       cached or a RAM disk is recommended.  See the note below for swap
       size requirements, optimization suggestions, and potential clean-up
       problems.

       BASIC MAPEDIT REQUIREMENTS

       Required Files

       7 files (1 is optional) plus some temporary disk space for swapping
       data, are required for MAPEDIT to operate. All files except 2 game
       files must reside in the same directory, although not necessarily
       in the directory of the game being edited. If you place the MAPEDIT
       files in other than the game's directory you will need to tell
       MAPEDIT where the game's files are located. Use the optional
       MAPEDIT.INI file for this.

       MAPEDIT.EXE (map editor program)

       EGAVGA.BGI (required by editor for graphics)

       Data Definition Files

       MAPDATA.xxx + OBJDATA.xxx (default extensions are the same as
                                  the game files)
       These above 2 files are used to equate the numeric codes within
       the game's Map files to graphic symbols for MAPEDIT to display in
       the Map window. You may modify either data file if you choose.
       See page 30 for an explanation of how these files are constructed.

       MAPEDIT.INI (Optional file)

       Game Files

       There are 2 game files that contain the maps and pointers to all
       the game's existing levels. The names are listed below. Be sure you
       save copies of the original files BEFORE you use the editor the
       first time as MAPEDIT reads and modifies these files.

       WOLF3D & Spear of Destiny

       MAPHEAD.xxx + GAMEMAPS.xxx
       (xxx = WL3 or WL6 for WOLF3D)
       (xxx = SOD for Spear of Destiny)

       Blake Stone

       MAPHEAD.xxx + MAPTEMP.xxx
       (xxx = BS3 or BS6)






                                      -9-
       Mapedit Swap Space

       MAPEDIT requires temporary disk space to be available as a "swap
       directory" during execution.  You will be prompted for a drive
       letter to use for this swap space. (If you designate the drive
       letter in the optional MAPEDIT.INI file, you will not be prompted).

       If you're using a hard disk cache program such as SMARTDRV, for
       example, then using an uncompressed drive will do very nicely. If
       not, a RAM drive is a suitable alternative for this purpose. You
       might want to try both to see which works best for you.

       A subdirectory named MAPSWAP.DIR will be created on whatever drive
       you specify. Assuming the program terminates normally, this
       directory and all its contents will be deleted automatically. If
       for any reason MAPEDIT aborts, it will still attempt to delete the
       MAPSWAP.DIR directory and all its files. If unsuccessful, you will
       have to manually remove all files within the directory, then remove
       the directory from the drive you specified. The DOS command DELTREE
       that is available with DOS Version 6 is an excellent tool for this.

       The amount of disk space required in the subdirectory depends on
       the complexity of the maps, and will vary as you make edits.  A
       good rule of thumb is to have at least twice as much space
       available as the size of the original GAMEMAPS.xxx (or MAPTEMP.xxx)
       file.  (This usually will be about 600k to 700k bytes.)

       When MAPEDIT is first started, all of the levels are read from the
       GAMEMAPS/MAPTEMP file into the swap disk.  In addition, as you
       scroll through the levels using the up and down arrow keys, levels
       are swapped to and from disk.  Due to the inherent I/O time, it is
       for this reason that we recommend you set up a RAM disk, and use a
       subdirectory there as the swap dir.  This will eliminate disk
       access except for the initial reading of the GAMEMAPS/MAPTEMP file
       and saving the edited version upon quitting MAPEDIT.

















                                     -10-
       HOW MAPEDIT OPERATES

       Each of the 3 games that MAPEDIT processes contain a pair of files
       that consist of all the floor maps in a game and pointers to each
       floor in the map file. MAPEDIT reads these files (the pointer file
       first), and writes them as individual floor files to temporary disk
       storage where they are accessible to MAPEDIT during editing .

       Game Map Pointer files for all three games have the name MAPHEAD.
       The actual Game Map files are named GAMEMAPS for both WOLF3D and
       SoD. The Game Map file for Blake Stone is named MAPTEMP.

       During editing, floors can be exchanged with one another, or
       replaced with other imported floors. Individual floors can also be
       written (exported) to the hard disk using the 'W' (Write) command -
       this is a COPY operation as the original floor being exported is
       not erased. When a copy of a floor is exported to hard disk it
       becomes independent of the original map file. It cannot be edited
       or viewed again until it is imported to an existing game map file.

       Existing floors can be imported to a Clipboard in MAPEDIT using the
       'R' (Read) command for placement on any existing level within the
       game being edited. From the Clipboard the floor must be Transferred
       to some desired level before it can be viewed and edited. This
       causes the original floor to be overlaid.

       When you finish editing and are ready to quit MAPEDIT, you will be
       prompted for whether you want to save any changes made during the
       edit operation. If you reply YES, all floors on all levels are
       rewritten to the game's map file. This replaces the original copy
       of the map file. Saving is not the same as writing (exporting)
       individual floors; Saving saves all floors into one file; Writing
       creates a single file consisting of one floor only.



















                                     -11-
       HELP

       Help while running MAPEDIT is available online by pressing either
       F1, F2, or F3. F1 provides help with the keyboard. F2 displays help
       with the mouse. And F3 is used to give help for the Large Hex
       Values used in Blake Stone editing.

       Semantics

       For most, the terms LEVEL and FLOOR mean the same thing. However,
       for this document they have distinctly different meanings. A LEVEL
       is a position within an episode or entire game that is in a fixed
       position. A FLOOR is a unique map that resides in some LEVEL, but
       can be moved to another LEVEL or written to disk for safe-keeping.
       Every LEVEL must contain a FLOOR -- there are no "empty "LEVELS",
       only empty FLOORS. Each LEVEL has a unique name. Within the
       structure of MAPEDIT it also assigned a unique number. BSTONE
       levels number from 0; WOLF3D and SoD levels start with number 1.

       Loading MAPEDIT

       Upon loading MAPEDIT (by typing MAPEDIT on the DOS command line),
       you will see a string of messages at the top of the screen which
       will list all the map floors that are being loaded into the swap
       drive. When this is complete, the screen will display the 1st floor
       in the first episode/mission (level #1 in all 3 games).

       Map Window

       The Map window occupies most of the screen. To the right of the map
       is a Legend window. The legend shows the first screen full of
       Mapdata definitions which have been read from the MAPDATA.xxx file.
       The Objdata definition legend can be toggled onto the screen by
       pressing the SpaceBar. Depending on whether you are viewing Mapdata
       or Objdata, you will be in either Map Mode or Object Mode. In Map
       mode only map items are selectable; in Object mode only object
       items.

       Underneath the Legend window is a small area that lists some Hot-
       keys that you can press to initiate several different functions.
       These are all discussed below in detail. The complete list of hot-
       keys are also available in help screens by pressing F1 or F2.

       Depending on where the mouse pointer is located, there are several
       fields of information available directly under the Map Window. If
       the mouse pointer is within the Map Window, the information below
       it consists of 4 fields of information. (Note: if the mouse pointer
       fails to appear in the Map window, press L-shift+R-shift to force
       it on.) On the left are the data definitions currently assigned to
       both the left and right mouse. To the right is the location (in
       decimal) of where the mouse pointer is in the Map window. These are
       column:row (or x:y) coordinates. To the right of the coordinates is

                                     -12-
       the word "MAP:" followed by the name of the map item where the
       mouse is pointing.

       Directly underneath are optionally the same map coordinates, but in
       hex this time - this hex value can be toggled on and off. Following
       the optional hex coordinates is the word "OBJ:" followed by the
       name of the object item where the mouse is pointing. (It is common
       to have both an object and a map code exist in the same square).
       NOTE: By pressing ALT+H, the words MAP: and  OBJ: will be toggled
       off and be replaced by the codes of the items being pointed at by
       the mouse. Pressing ALT+H again will cause the words MAP: and OBJ:
       to reappear. The default for this can be controlled by a variable
       in the optional MAPEDIT.INI file.

       When the mouse pointer is outside the Map Window the coordinate
       lines are replaced by 2 lines of different information. The top
       line will indicate whether you are in Map Mode or Object Mode. The
       line underneath will display the number and name of the level you
       are currently viewing.

       Selecting a Floor Map to Edit

       Use the Pgup/Pgdn keys to sequentially scroll through the map
       levels until you locate the floor you want to edit. When you reach
       the end of the available map levels, the display will wrap around
       to the 1st/last map of the game (depending on which direction you
       were scrolling).

       To select any level without scrolling sequentially, use the "G"
       (GoTo) hot-key to display a list of all the level numbers and names
       in the Legend Window. Use the INS/DEL keys to single line scroll or
       up/down arrow keys to page scroll through the list for the level
       you want, then move the mouse pointer to the selected level and
       click on the left mouse button.

       Map Window Details

       A floor map is 64 by 64 squares, and as stated above, the map
       consists of 2 basic ingredients: Map data (floors, walls, and
       doors), and Object data (everything else). Both can be displayed
       independently or all at once. Also Objects can be displayed
       selectively instead of all at once. Object data is further defined
       as being either Static (it doesn't move), or Active (it does move).
       Active objects are mostly the actors (guards), but there are a few
       other objects that are classed as Actives (Blake Stone game only).
       See BSTONE.DOC for a complete discussion of Active Objects and
       their effect on play.

       By default, the floor codes are not visible when the editor is
       first loaded. (The default can be changed by use of the optional
       MAPEDIT.INI file - see below). In order to see them, you press the


                                     -13-
       'F' hot-key which will toggle them on the screen. Since floor codes
       and object codes often exist together, you may want to turn off the
       object codes when viewing the floor codes. You can toggle them off
       by pressing the 'O' hot-key. (Walls and doors normally remain
       visible on the screen). Everything in the Map window is manipulated
       using the mouse.

       NOTE: From time-to-time, the Map Window will be redrawn on the
       screen. If you do something that causes the redraw to stop before
       it is complete, do not panic. Just press Pgup followed by Pgdn and
       this time let it finish redrawing before proceeding.

       Mouse Use in the Map Window

       Since there are at least 2 buttons on every mouse, you can use the
       left and right buttons to hold 2 different Map item codes or 2
       different Object item codes, depending on the Legend mode you are
       currently in. Both button values are displayed in the lower left
       corner of the screen under the Map Window.

       Selecting a Definition For Either Mouse Button

       There are 2 ways to select a data definition for a mouse button.
       You can either move the mouse over to the Legend window and point
       to the symbol you want to select and push the appropriate mouse
       button, or you can point to an object or map symbol in the Map
       window, hold down a Shift key and click the mouse to pick up the
       desired item. (Using this latter method will cause the Legend
       window to be repositioned with the selected item displayed in the
       window).

       Inserting an Item on the Map

       After assigning an item to either mouse button, move the mouse to
       the location on the map where you want the item to be inserted and
       click the appropriate mouse button to place the item on the map.
       This has the effect of erasing any object currently at the chosen
       location and inserting a new one in its place.

       Removing an Item from the Map

       To remove (erase) an item anywhere on the map, select the
       appropriate Legend Mode (Map or Object) and do the following.
       If the item is Object Data, select the item marked "Nothing" at the
       top of the Object Legend Window, then move the mouse over to the
       item in the Map Window you want to erase, then click on the mouse
       button that has "Nothing" assigned to it. This works for LHV object
       items in BLAKE STONE too. If you want to remove a Map Data item
       (wall, door, or floor code),  you must replace it with another
       wall, door, or floor code. Remember, every square on the map must
       have a Map Data item on it.


                                     -14-
       Changing Multiple Items of One Type

       If there are multiple items of a single type that you would like to
       change all at once, assign the replacement item (object or map) to
       a mouse button, then position the mouse over one of the items to be
       replaced in the Map window. While holding down both the Alt and
       Ctrl keys simultaneously, click on the selected mouse button.

       Clearing the Map Window

       When starting a fresh design, it is often desireable to start with
       a clear Map window. You do this by assigning a floor OR wall code
       from the mapdata Legend window to the left mouse button. Then you
       move the mouse to any spot in the map window and press the 'C' key.
       Before anything happens you will be prompted to be sure you want
       the entire floor to be cleared. The entire window will be filled
       with the selected floor or wall code, thus erasing everything that
       was previously there. There will also be 4 perimeter walls visible.
       To view the floor codes, toggle the floor codes on.

       Drawing Mode

       You can use the mouse to draw rectangles of map data types. This is
       especially useful when creating a new map. Start by selecting a Map
       data item. Move the mouse to where you want a corner of the
       rectangle to be. While holding the left mouse button, move the
       mouse either right or left in the direction you want the rectangle
       to appear, then up or down to open the rectangle. Release the mouse
       button when you are done. You can draw odd shapes by simply adding
       on to a previous rectangle.

       NOTE: Previously placed objects will remain in their original
       positions, so be careful not to end up with guards embedded in
       walls.

       The mouse can also be used to draw walls and other items that need
       to be repeated. Just select the item with either mouse button. Move
       the mouse into the map window where you want to replicate the item
       and hold the appropriate button down while dragging the mouse in
       the desired direction.

       Viewing Objects Selectively

       The following is a list of keys you can use to selectively display
       various objects in the Map window.

       Key     Function
         1  -  Display only Level 1 enemies
         2  -  Display only treasure and One-ups
         3  -  Display only Level 3 enemies
         4  -  Display only Level 4 enemies
         5  -  Display only Super Bosses

                                     -15-
         6  -  Display only Ammo, Weapons, Food, First Aid, and One-ups
         #  -  Display only Level 1 and 3 enemies
         $  -  Display only Level 1, 3, and 4 enemies
         %  -  Display only enemies (all skill levels)
         A  -  Display All Objects

       Other Selective Viewing Option

       You can click on the left mouse button while holding down the Ctrl
       key (Ctrl+click) to selectively display any map data or object
       data. You select the item(s) to be displayed by either pointing the
       mouse at them in the Map Window or in the Legend Window. The item
       displayed will depend on which Legend Mode you are currently in. If
       you are displaying selected Objects and you prefer not to have the
       map data visible, you can use the ALT+M hot-key to toggle off all
       map data. (The default for this toggle can be set up in the
       MAPEDIT.INI file).  Use the "A" key to restore the full display.

       Legend Window

       To change Legend Modes, press the Space Bar. To scroll vertically,
       use the up/down arrow keys. Use the Home and End keys to get to the
       top and bottom respectively. Use the INS (up), DEL (down) keys to
       scroll vertically one line at a time. (Please note that the INS key
       cannot be held down for repeated use). Use the left/right arrows to
       scroll horizontally. Hold down the Ctrl key with the left/right
       arrows to scroll horizontally 10 columns at a time. Pressing HOME,
       END, or Space will return the window to the far left. As you toggle
       back and forth between Legend modes, the legend will always remain
       where you last used it.

       You can also use the mouse to scroll the Legend vertically. Place
       the mouse pointer on either the UP or DOWN box under the window and
       press the left mouse button to Page the Legend up or down. Use the
       right mouse button to scroll the Legend one line at a time.

       After each guard/enemy displayed in the Object Legend window is a
       3 or 4 character description that specifies what level the actor
       is, whether he is moving or stationary, and what direction he is
       facing or walking. For example, "1/S/E" means a level 1 actor,
       stationary, facing east.

       NOTE: In Blake Stone some Perscan Drones use an "SM" designation.
       This means they start out stationary, but when alerted will start
       to move.

       At the bottom of the Legend window are four boxes (buttons) which
       you can point at with the mouse to select the other Legend window
       or to scroll up and down the current window. The button labeled
       XTRA, which means EXTRA, is displayed only when editing Blake Stone
       floors. It provides access to some additional editing features
       which will be described later.

                                     -16-
       MAPEDIT Hot-Keys & Scrolling Keys

       There are a number of Hot-keys and scrolling keys- some of which
       have already been described, but are described more completely
       below - that provide many useful functions. These are listed below
       and some of them are displayed in the small window in the lower

                                     -17-
       C Command (Clear Map Window)

       Start by selecting a floor or wall code with the left mouse button.
       Move the mouse pointer to the Map Window and press the 'C' key. You
       will be prompted to reply 'Y' or 'N' to okay or disapprove the
       request to clear before anything happens. The result of replying
       'Y' will be the entire window set to the selected floor or wall
       code except for the 4 perimeter walls which will be set to the
       default wall type. All previous object, wall, and floor data in the
       map window will be erased. Replying with anything other than 'Y' or
       'N' will be ignored.

       D Command (Load New Map and Obj Definition Files)

       After pressing the 'D' key you will be prompted for a new data
       definition file extension (up to 3 characters). If you change your
       mind, press the Esc key to return to editing. After entering the
       extension, both new Map and Obj files will be loaded and the Map
       Window redrawn to display the result.

       E Command (Exchanging floors)

       See section below entitled "Manipulating Maps".

       F Command (Toggle Floor data On and Off)

       Pressing the 'F' key will toggle the floor code display on and off
       in the Map Window. The default setting is set by MAPEDIT.INI.

       G Command (Goto Level)

       Pressing the 'G' key will produce a list of all level numbers and
       level names in the area of the Legend Window. Use the up/down arrow
       keys to page through the list, or INS/DEL to move a line at a time.
       Move the mouse pointer to select a level then click the left mouse
       button to cause the selected level to be displayed.

       H Command (Toggle Hex Mode on/off)

       Use the 'H' key to cause map coordinates to be displayed in both
       decimal and hex below the Map Window or to toggle off the hex
       values. The default setting for this is controlled by can the
       MAPEDIT.INI file. For Blake Stone only, the LHV's are also toggled
       between HEX and DECIMAL. All other object codes are always
       displayed in hex.

       Alt+H Command (Toggle Item Hex Values On/Off)

       This command causes the words MAP: and OBJ: underneath the Map
       Window to be replaced with the hex values of the data items being
       pointed at by the mouse. Pressing Alt+H again toggles the words


                                     -18-
       MAP: and OBJ: on again. The default setting for this is controlled
       by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

       L Command (Toggle LHV Display) - Blake Stone Only

       The 'L' command toggles the LHV display graphics on/off. Having
       them toggled on will show where the LHV codes are. Toggling them
       off will display what is underneath the LHV codes. The default
       setting for this is controlled by MAPEDIT.INI.

       M Command (Memorize Present Map)

       See section below entitled "Manipulating Maps"

       Alt+M Command (Toggle Map Data During Selective Viewing)

       The Alt+M command is used to toggle Map Data on and off when
       viewing selected Objects. When Map data is left on, the selected
       objects are sometimes difficult to locate in the Map Window.
       Turning off Map data viewing displays only the selected object
       symbols in the Map Window. The default setting for this toggle
       action is controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

       N Command (Change the Name of the Current Level)

       Use the 'N' command to assign a different name to the current
       level. The name of the current level is displayed beneath the Map
       Window when the mouse pointer is outside the window. When you press
       the 'N' key, you will be prompted for a new name - up to 16
       characters. It may consist of any numeric or alphabetic characters
       as well as spaces, period (.), underscore (_), or dash (-). Note
       that this name will not be preserved in a floor file written with
       the 'W' command. The name is associated with the level where it
       appears regardless of what floor map fills that position. The name
       will be saved in the .WL6, .SOD, or .BS6 game map file.

       O Command (Toggle Object Data On/Off)

       Use the 'O' command to toggle Object data on and off. This command
       is similar to the 'F' command above which toggles Floor codes on
       and off. It is often useful to have Object data removed from the
       Map Window when examining floor codes. The default setting for this
       toggle action is controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

       Q Command (Quit Mapedit)

       Use the 'Q' command to end the current edit session. You will be
       prompted to save all the floors or not. Replying 'N' will cause all
       editing changes to be lost. Replying 'Y' will cause all floor files
       that are in the Swap Directory to be saved in the Game Map file,
       which will replace the original file. If you change your mind about
       ending the edit session, press the Esc key.

                                     -19-
       R Command (Read/Import a Floor File from Disk to Clipboard)

       See section below entitled "Manipulating Maps"

       S Command (Toggle between Stats Display and Hot-key Display)

       Use the 'S' command to toggle between the display of Statistics and
       the Hot-key display. Leaving the Stats displayed during editing
       will slow the editing process somewhat as each change to the
       contents of the Map Window will cause the statistics to be
       recalculated. The default setting for this toggle action is
       controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file.

       Alt+S Command (Display Count of Items in Legend Window)

       Pressing Alt+S will toggle on and off a display of the count of the
       individual items listed in the Legend Window. The default setting
       for Alt+S is controlled by the MAPEDIT.INI file. As with the 'S'
       command, Alt+S can slow the editing process somewhat if left
       toggled on (See 'S' command above).

       T Command (Transfer Clipboard Map Into Current Level)

       See the section below entitled "Manipulating Maps".

       W Command (Write the Current Floor to Hard Disk)

       See the section below entitled "Manipulating Maps".

       Z Command (Set/Zap) floorcodes within room

       Use the 'Z' command to "Zap" all floor codes in an enclosed area to
       a new floor code which has been selected using the LEFT mouse
       button. All floor codes except "deaf guard" codes will be replaced
       within the enclosed area with the selected floor code. After
       selecting a new floor code, move the mouse pointer to the enclosed
       target area and press the 'Z' key.

       Alt+Z Command (Similar to 'Z' Command - see above)

       Use the Alt+Z command to replace/zap all floor codes in an enclosed
       area including "deaf guard" codes.

       Manipulating Maps

       Besides being able to edit any particular map, you will often find
       it desireable to copy/move floors from one level to another and
       even exchange floors between levels. You can also Read and Write
       individual floors from/to hard disk for safe keeping at
       intermediate stages of development. Or you can save a floor to be
       shipped to someone else for inclusion in their game. Note that the
       receiver of your floors must have a copy of MAPEDIT to be able to

                                     -20-
       use the floor file. The Hot-key commands listed below deal with
       these features.

       E Command (Exchange Currently Displayed Floor With Floor Stored in
       Clipboard)

       To exchange 2 floors, copy one of the floors to the clipboard ('M'
       command), then use the 'E' command to Exchange the floor in the
       clipboard with the second floor involved in the exchange. Last,
       transfer the floor now in the clipboard to the position where the
       first floor was located. Use the 'E' hot-key for the Exchange
       function.

       M Command (Copy/Memorize Floor to Clipboard)

       MAPEDIT contains a clipboard for temporary storage of a copy of any
       floor you are currently viewing or one that you have imported from
       your hard disk. If you do nothing with the clipboard copy, it will
       be lost when you quit the game. To copy the current floor to the
       clipboard, use the 'M' (for Memorize) hot-key.

       R Command (Read/Import a Floor from Hard Disk to the Clipboard)

       Use the 'R' hot-key to initiate the READ function. You will be
       prompted for the full DOS filename of the floor file to be read.
       The file must exist in the current directory or in the location
       specified in Mapedit.INI.  The file will then be read into the
       Clipboard where it can be exchanged with another floor or
       transferred to the current level.

       T Command (Transfer a Floor from Clipboard to Current Level)

       Once there is a map floor in the Clipboard it can be transferred to
       any other level. The current floor that existed before the transfer
       operation is lost unless you saved it first by writing it to disk
       or used the Exchange hot-key. Use the 'T' hot-key to transfer a
       floor from the Clipboard. Transfer is used along with the Exchange
       command when you want to exchange floors between levels.

       W Command (Write/Export the Current Floor to Hard Disk)

       Use the 'W' hot-key to initiate the WRITE function. The floor to be
       written to disk is written directly from the floor currently
       displayed. Do not copy it first to the Clipboard. You will be
       prompted for a DOS filename to give the floor. The file will be
       stored in the current directory or in a directory specified in
       MAPEDIT.INI.





                                     -21-
       Statistics

       The statistics display, which is toggled on and off using the 'S'
       hot-key, keeps track of the following information:

            Static Objects
            Total Guards (Wolf3D & SoD)
            Active Objects (Blake Stone only)
            Doors

            Level 1 Guards
            Level 3 Guards
            Level 4 Guards
            Boss Guards

            Secret Doors
            $$$ / One-ups

       This information can be very useful in designing floors.  There are
       some program limits that must not be exceeded.  These limits are
       the same in all 3 games:

           399 Static Objects
           149 Guards (Wolf3D & SoD only)
           149 Active Objects (Blake Stone only)
           64 Doors - Unlocked/Locked/Elevator

       When these limits are exceeded, the text changes to red as a visual
       warning. If you play a game with the limits exceeded, it will abort
       - usually gracefully, but not always! You should always check your
       STATS before quitting MAPEDIT.

       WARNING: Map window scrolling and map modifications are slightly
       inhibited by leaving the STAT display toggled on. It is recommended

       MAPEDIT.INI file

       An optional file included in the MAPEDIT package is a MAPEDIT.INI
       file. This file can be used to change defaults that are used by the
       editor.

       The file currently contains 12 variables that can be edited with
       any Ascii editor. Below are the variable names and their default
       values.

       The MAPEDIT.INI file included is a sample of how these variables
       are coded. You can use the sample file by changing the definitions
       to suit your needs.

       To expand a bit on a couple of the variables in the list above,
       "game_path" can be used to define the name and location of the
       directory where the MAPHEAD and GAMEMAPS or MAPTEMP files are
       located, if not in the current directory. In any case, the order of
       search is: (1) .WL3, (2) .WL6 (3) .SOD (4) .BS6. Whichever one is
       found first defines the game to be edited.

       Once the game being edited is known, the Map and Object definition
       files are sought. They must reside in the same directory as
       MAPEDIT. If you specify 'XXX' as the def_file_extension parameter

                                     -23-
       in the .INI file, then the files are assumed to be MAPDATA.XXX and
       OBJDATA.XXX.

       EDITING FEATURES UNIQUE TO BLAKE STONE

       As indicated earlier, Blake Stone floors have a number of unique
       features that do not exist in either WOLF3D or SoD. To understand
       what the features are and how they work, you need to study the
       companion document - BSTONE.DOC - for details. This section will
       describe how the editor is used to implement these features. Also
       included in this package is a simple Blake Stone floor map that
       contains samples of most of the Large Hex Values used in Blake
       Stone.

       Map Coordinates

       Before proceeding with a discussion of how Blake Stone features are
       implemented by MAPEDIT, it is important to consider some points
       about map coordinates. Several of the new features require that
       some square (or coordinate) of the map be identified as a target
       location. This is true for Teleporters, Barrier Switches, and
       doors.

       Any location or coordinate on the map consists of an X (column) and
       Y (row) value. Since a map is 64 by 64 squares, this results in an
       X and Y range of 00 to 3F (hex). A square located in the 10th
       column and 9th row, for instance, would have an X:Y value of '0A09'
       (hex). If this square, '0A09', happened to be the target coordinate
       of a Barrier switch, i.e., the location of a Barrier object, then
       MAPEDIT would store the coordinate at the appropriate location on
       the map as an LHV (Large Hex Value). In addition, the Blake Stone
       engine would eventually recognize '0A09' at game time and handle it
       accordingly.

       Coordinates Vs. Objects

       However, there is a problem when the X:Y coordinates fall in the
       range of 0000 to 023F. If you scan the OBJDATA file you will
       immediately notice that the above range of values also represents
       much of the Object data in the game. As a result, if a target
       coordinate is '011b', for example, it will show up on the floor map
       as a Perscan Drone rather than as LHV object data. In most cases
       the Blake Stone engine will discriminate between what is a map
       coordinate and what is a true object. But not always.

       The bottom line to all this: AVOID PLACING ANY OBJECT DATA IN THE
       LEFT-MOST 3 COLUMNS OF THE FLOOR MAP THAT ARE ALSO COORDINATE
       TARGETS. These left-most 3 columns fall in the range of 0000 to
       023F.

       To be very specific, don't place Barriers, Teleporters, Auto-Doors,
       or Linked Doors in the left-most 3 columns of the map.

                                     -24-
       FEATURE IMPLEMENTATIONS

       The features that are described below are:

       Food Units
       Automatic Opening Doors
       Linked Doors
       Teleporters
       Barriers and barrier switches
       Bio-Tech messages
       Time Delays
       Ceiling and Floor Textures
       Ceiling and Floor Colors

       Food Units

       When you select either Food Unit 1 or 2 from the Map Legend Window
       and insert it into the Map Window, you will be prompted to indicate
       whether the food unit is to be operational or "Not in Working
       Order". If the unit is to be operational, then you will be prompted
       again to select how many items of food the unit is to dispense.
       Supply a number and press Enter. The result of the above actions
       will place LHV's over the Food Unit wall. You can view the LHV by
       pressing the 'L' key. LHV's can be toggled off by pressing the 'L'
       key again. (An LHV code symbol appears as a white block with a red
       center). Positioning the mouse pointer over an LHV symbol will
       display the hex code represented by the LHV symbol below the Map
       Window.

       Automatic Doors

       To cause any door to open automatically you must select a special
       floor code labeled "Auto Door Hot-Spot" from the Map Legend window.
       You then insert this code in the floor map at the chosen location
       just like inserting any other floor code. (The "hot-spot" is a kind
       of sensor that Stone can cross over which will then cause the
       selected door to open). When you insert the special code you will
       be prompted to move the mouse pointer to a door that you want the
       "hot-spot" or sensor to open. When you click the mouse button the
       X:Y coordinates, or location (an LHV) of the door will be placed on
       top of the "hot-spot". You may repeat this operation for as many
       sensors as you want to create for the single door. (It is
       recommended that you use at least 2 sensors on both sides of a
       selected door).

       Door Linkages (Pointers)

       To link doors together so that all linked doors appear to open
       simultaneously, select the Map code from the Map Legend window that
       is labeled "Auto Door Pointer". Next, move the mouse pointer to the
       first door in the chain of linked doors and click the mouse button.


                                     -25-
       Now point to the next door in the chain and click the mouse button
       again. This will cause a pointer (LHV) to the 2nd door to be placed
       at the location of the 1st door, thus creating the required
       linkage. To link additional doors, repeat the above procedure
       starting with the 2nd door (the one pointed to by the first door)
       and so on.

       NOTE: You can link 2 doors to each other by having each door
       pointing to the other. Both doors will open at the same time when
       either door is opened.

       Teleporters

       A Teleporter is inserted in the floor map using the Teleporter map
       code. When you place a Teleporter map code in the Map Window you
       will be prompted to choose whether the Teleporter is to be for
       "This Floor" (the current floor) or for a "Distant Floor" (in the
       same Mission). If for the current floor, you will be prompted to
       point to the location on the map of the receiving location (not
       necessarily another Teleporter), then click the mouse button. (If
       a Teleporter is used at the receiving location, the receiving
       position must ALWAYS be on a floor code immediately adjacent to the
       Teleporter symbol).

       If the Teleporter is to be used to transport Stone to a "distant
       floor" such as the secret level in the basement, then you will be
       prompted for the number of the receiving level. The receiving
       location must be at the same absolute coordinate as the sending
       location. Generally, the receiving location should have a
       Teleporter positioned where Blake will materialize. But another set
       of sending/receiving Teleporters can be used from the distant
       location back to the original location. Again, such Teleporters, if
       used, must exist at the same absolute coordinates.

       Barriers and Barrier Switches

       These instructions apply to both types of barriers (Post and Arc)
       used in the game. Whenever you use a barrier, you would normally
       place a barrier switch somewhere to raise (turn on) or lower (turn
       off) the barrier.

       Switches can operate barriers on either the current floor, or on a
       "distant floor" in the same Mission. When you insert a Barrier
       switch code into the Map window, you will be asked whether the
       barrier is in "this floor" (current floor) or a "distant floor". If
       you opt for the current floor, you will be prompted to point to one
       of the barrier symbols in the target barrier and click the mouse
       button which will cause the barrier switch to point to the correct
       barrier. NOTE: All adjacent barrier objects will switch on or off
       along with the targeted object of the switch.



                                     -26-
       If you select a barrier on a "distant floor", you will be prompted
       for the level number. At this time, the "distant floor" will be
       drawn on the screen and you will be prompted to point to a barrier
       object and click on the mouse. The original floor will be
       redisplayed and the location of the "distant barrier" will be
       placed on the barrier switch as an LHV. NOTE: If you mistakenly
       enter the wrong "distant" level number, then click at any location
       on the error level Map window. Now go back and repeat the operation
       to correct your error. (Nothing was stored on the error level).

       Bio Tech Messages

       Examine the end of the Object Legend window and you will find 3
       object codes used to trigger menus of messages used by Bio Techs.
       (This explanation assumes you are familiar with the section in
       BSTONE.DOC that describes how these messages are used).

       All 3 kinds of message codes have default locations on the floor.
       Loyalist message codes are stored along the West perimeter wall.
       Informant message codes are stored in the southwest corner of the
       south wall. However, you can force any of these message codes to be
       placed anywhere else on the floor near one or more Bio-techs.

       The Object code in the legend window for Informant messages is
       0256. Point and click on this code. If you want the message code
       stored at the default location then move the mouse pointer anywhere
       in the Map window and click again. If you want to place the message
       code at other than the default location, then move the mouse to
       that location and click the button. In either case a menu of
       Informant messages will appear in place of the Legend window. Use
       the left and right arrow keys to scroll left and right in order to
       see the entire message. Point to the message you want to use and
       click the mouse. You will be prompted for whether the message code
       is to be inserted at the default location for Informant messages or
       to some other location. Enter your choice.

       The Object code in the legend window for Loyalist "warning"
       messages (delayed action) is 0257 and "alarm" messages (immediate
       action) is 0258. Process the selected message in the same way as
       described above for Informant messages.

       Time Delays

       Time delays are used to manage the "hatching" of Pod Aliens, the
       "energization" of Mutant guards, and the release rate of Plasma
       Aliens. When you want to insert one of these objects into the floor
       map, you will be prompted for whether you want a time delay used or
       not. If so, you will then be prompted for the value of the delay -
       a number from 00 to FF. Press the enter key and an LHV representing
       the time delay will be placed on the floor next to or on the object
       in question. (The lower the number, the shorter the delay).


                                     -27-
       Ceiling and Floor Textures

       In order to control the ceiling and floor textures of each floor,
       you can insert the appropriate default LHV object codes on the map
       by using the XTRA button at the bottom of the Legend Window.  Point
       the mouse at the XTRA button and click the mouse. You will now see
       a button marked "MAP", click the mouse on it. At this point you
       will be prompted to enter a value for one of 4 selections. Since
       this is a discussion of Ceiling and Floor Textures, enter a number
       for either Ceiling or Floor texture. This last action will trigger
       a menu of texture codes which will appear in place of the Legend
       window. Use the mouse to point to a code, then click the mouse on
       it. Next, repeat the procedure for the other texture value. Again,
       you are referred to the BSTONE.DOC Appendix for which values are
       available.

       NOTE: The XTRA button can also be used to enter any LHV data
       manually anywhere on the floor. After selecting XTRA, then select
       HEX and follow the prompts.

       Ceiling and Floor Colors

       See the discussion under Ceiling and Floor Textures for how to
       enter the default values for ceiling and floor colors. The main
       difference here is that a menu of color codes will not appear. You
       will be prompted to enter the color code you want.

       The color selections are listed in the Appendix of BSTONE.DOC.

       Unlike ceiling and floor textures, ceiling and floor colors can be
       made to change dynamically while the game is being played. To
       implement these changes on the floor, examine the end of the Object
       Legend window. There you will find the codes 0259 and 025a. 0259
       represents ceiling colors and 025a represents floor colors. Point
       the mouse and click on the code you want. Next, point to the
       location on the floor where you want the color change to take place
       and click on the mouse button. You will be prompted to enter a
       ceiling color value. After pressing ENTER, the LHV's for your
       choice will be placed at the location originally pointed to by the
       mouse.

       Repeat the above procedure for entering a floor color choice. Point
       to the same location on the floor as previously used for the
       ceiling color.








                                     -28-
       Using Multiple Push-Wall Codes

       When setting up a series of push-wall codes such that one section
       of wall will be pushed 2 or more times there is a "rule" to be
       observed. To be certain you understand, in order to push one
       section of wall more than once, you insert push-wall codes on a
       floor 2 squares apart so that each time a wall is pushed, it will
       stop on top of another push-wall code. The wall can then be pushed
       again. For an example, view the basement level of Mission 4.

       The "rule" for doing this is that multiple push-wall codes must not
       be used adjacent to an outer perimeter wall (a single code is
       okay). The result of using multiple push-wall codes in this manner
       will cause the game to immediately abort the instant the wall is
       pushed the 2nd time, with an error message from Blake Stone stating
       "Invalid Page Request".

       Other Error Conditions

       When creating a Blake Stone map, you are limited to the following
       numbers of certain items per floor:

       Dr. Goldfire sites: 10
       Electro-Alien Walls: 12
       Food Units: 15
       Unique barrier switch coordinates: 5
       Static Objects: 399
       Active Objects: 149
       Doors: 64

       Format of the Data Definition Files

       This section was contributed by Peter Burrough.

         The encoding for the input lines in the ???DATA.xxx files is as

         where:

           "nnnn" is the map/object code (leading zeroes required, value
                  in hex, any mixture of upper/lower case permitted for
                  hex digits)

           col 5  is ignored

           "psgc" is the code indicating the graphic code on the map
                  display (described below)

           col 10 is ignored

           "t..t" is the narrative for the entity (note that the program
                  will accept up to 20 characters, but will only display
                  16!) If less than 16 characters are present, the
                  narrative will be padded to 16 with nulls/blanks.

                  NOTE: If there are non-blank characters in columns
                  17-20, they will be truncated in the legend scroll list,
                  but will appear in the other narrative areas below the
                  map.

           "x..." is ignored (can be used for comments)
                  (column 30 onwards)

         Graphic Type
         ------------

         Columns 6-9 in the ???DATA.xxx files define how the object will
         look in the map.  Any alphabetics in columns 6/7/8 MUST be in
         lower case!

         "psgc" is the code indicating the graphic type on the map display

          where:

           "p" is the primary color

           "s" is the secondary color
            (direction flag when "g" = f)
            (unused for some other values of "g")

           "g" is the graphic type

           "c" is the character to be displayed ("g" = 0 [text] ONLY)
               (value should be zero for all other values of "g")

         Color codes ["p" and "s"] (values a-f MUST be coded as lower
         case!)

           0 - black       "s" for type "f":  0 = N

         Graphic types ["g"] (values a-f MUST be coded as lower case):

           NOTE: the graphics type codes are treated as CHARACTER, not as
           hexadecimal values, so it is possible to extend the range of

           f * - arrow
                 (secondary color indicates direction - see below)

                 type 'f' uses the secondary color field ["s"] for the
                 direction of the arrow, as follows:

                0 = N
                1 = NE
                2 = E

                7 = NW

         Special cases
         -------------

           Type "1" is a special case of type "3" or "8" (if "p" = "s" for
           these types, the result is the same as type "1").

           Type "b" is a special case of type "3" or "4" (if "p" = 0 for
           these types, the result is the same as type "b").
