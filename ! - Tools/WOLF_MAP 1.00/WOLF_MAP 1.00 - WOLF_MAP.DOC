Description
-----------

To convert the MapEdit 7.0 individual saved maps to an ASCII output.


History
-------
26-Oct-1993
After using MapEdit 7.0 for a few days I could not remember what each map
look like.  I found I saving duplicates.  Solution was simple - write a
program to convert the saved maps into ASCII.

27-Oct-1993 0.50
First working program.  Map 128 by 64.  But was to big to print out or view
easily on screen.

28-Oct-1993 0.80
Added second map size. Map 64 by 64.  I can now print it out if I increase
the number on lines/inches to 7.  Can see most of the map on the screen.
But left the default as the bigger map.
Added the use of wild card characters to the floor filenames.  If no
extension on filename the extension of .FLR is assumed.
Added auto -U update of changed maps.
Added generation of new maps only with -N -n.

29-Oct-1993 0.90
Added legends output for both size maps.  The legends will reflect any
changes in the WOLF_MAP.DEF file.

02-Nov-1993 1.00
Release date.

Usage
-----

Usage: WOLF_MAP [-M|m] Floor[.ext] [[-M|m] Floor[.ext]]...

    Floor = One floor map from MAPEDIT 7.0.  Output = Floor.MAP
              Wild card characters allowed
    ext = if none given .FLR is assumed.
    -M = Output large map 128x64. (default)
    -m = Output small map 64x64

WOLF_MAP [-U] [-N|n] Floor[.ext] [[-N|n] Floor[.ext]]...",

    -U = Update all floors who file date is different than the map date
         The size of the maps will remain the same.  No new maps
    -N = include New large maps for floors with no maps
    -n = include New small maps for floors with no maps
       Default is no maps for new floors.

WOLF_MAP -L|l

    -L = Output legend of large map symbols.  LEGEND.MAP
    -l = Output legend of small map symbols.  LEGENDs.MAP


Commands
--------

Wolf_map can execute several commands. A detailed description of each
command follows below.

-? or error
    Show usage information on the screen.

Floor
    Individual saved floor map from MAPEDIT 7.0 will be converted to a map
    file named Floor.MAP.  Wild card characters allowed

ext
    Filename extension, if none given .FLR is assumed.

-M
    Output large map 128x64. Each map location will have a two character code
    (Guard fixed G1 G3 G4). Giving more detail of what is where.
    If there is an object at the same location of a none space map location
    the second map character will be replaced by the first object character.
    Thus an actor standing inside a wall (making a walk thru wall) will show
    up.

-m
    Output small map 64x64.  Each map location will have a one character code
    (Guard any h g G).  The walk thru walk will be indicated by a W, this is
    fix and can not be changed.

-U
    Update all floors who file date is different than the map date.  The size
    of the maps will remain the same.

-N
    New large maps for floors with no maps.  Floors with maps will not change.

-n
    New small maps for floors with no maps.  Floors with maps will not change.

-L
    Output legend of large map symbols.  LEGEND.MAP

-l
    Output legend of small map symbols.  LEGENDs.MAP


Definition file format
----------------------

The current known objects are stored in a text file, WOLF_MAP.DEF.  This
file must be in the default directory or in the same directory as the program.

Since this file is in text format, you can edit it using any normal ASCII
editor. If you figure out a new object, you can add it's description
to the map / object list respectively.  Each line in the file contains
4 fields (you MUST follow this exact format):

11 22 3 4string

Field 1
    Map/Object in HEX  one or two character.  Two is best for alinement.

ONE SPACE only
    Some of the field 2 & 3 are space characters.

Field 2
    ASCII code for map.  2 character. Starts after 1st space. For proper
    display the first character must not be a space unless the code will be
    two spaces.  The second character can be a space.

ONE SPACE only
    Some of the field 2 & 3 are space characters.

Field 3
    ASCII code for map.  1 character. (smaller map)

Field 4
    Character description.  Only 30 characters will be used.


Object and Map character 00 is not need - will show a blank.


Any missing code will show as ??/? on map.  The number of unknown code will
be indicated at the bottom of the map.


For comments use ' at the start of the line.


Map tricks
----------

1. Place an actor inside a wall.  Makes a walk thru wall.

2. Place the 'Floor (dumb guard)' on both sides of a door.  Makes the door
   invisible, will not allow you to walk thru but the actors can.  The
   actors still see it as a door and will open it to walk thru.  While
   open you can walk out.

3. Place the 'Floor 1 (secret)' in front of the elevator to get to the
   secret level 10.

Error
-----

I found that maps generate by MapEdit Ver 4.1 will cause a runtime error
when reading into MapEdit 7.0 (I don't have the other versions.)  To fix
this error, 4 characters need to be added to the end of the data
file MAPGAMES.WL1.

I used:

ECHO ....>> MAPGAMES.WL1

This will append 6 characters to the end of the 4.1 MAPGAMES.WL1 files.
