<h1>Open a project</h1>
<p>Your first step to edit maps from a Wolfenstein 3D based game is to open the project 
folder which
contains the maps. Select <b>File | Open Project</b> or press <b>Ctrl+O</b> or click 
on 
<img src="open.gif" alt="" style="line-height: 12px; vertical-align: middle"> in 
the main window.</p>
<p>Next the "Select Directory" dialog box will appear. Here you have to select the 
project folder of
your Wolfenstein 3D based game.</p>
<p>If the selected map files have a file extension that doesn't exist as map definition 
in HWE, you'll
see a dialog asking you if you want to create a new map definition structure for 
these map files. Further
information on this particular topic can be found in the tutorial
"<a href="../3-Tutorials/tut1.html">Creating map definitions for HWE</a>".</p>
<p>Once you selected a project folder (and created a new map definition) you will 
be presented with the
"Load Project Files" dialog in which you need to select the file extension your map 
files have. Normally
the file extension is determined automatically for you, but you can change the file 
extension manually.
Be warned, however, that you won't be able to select your map files, if you selected 
a file extension
for the GAMEMAPS and MAPHEAD files which don't exist in the project folder.</p>

<p>You can also choose to load a WAD file with your maps in it (which is the preferred 
way to create
maps for source ports with WAD file support such as ECWolf) instead of selecting 
GAMEMAPS and MAPHEAD
files, given that a WAD file already exists for your project. In case you don't have 
a WAD file yet and
want to create one, you can find further information on this particular topic in 
the tutorial
"<a href="../3-Tutorials/tut4.html">Saving maps into a WAD file</a>". Please note 
that the WAD file
is not automatically determined for you, but needs to be selected by yourself.</p>
