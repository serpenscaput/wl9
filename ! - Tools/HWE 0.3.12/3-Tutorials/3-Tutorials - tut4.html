<h1>Saving maps into a WAD file</h1>
<p>If you want to save your maps into a WAD file, you only need to enable the "Save 
maps into WAD file" option,
inside the <a href="../2-Editing/mapconfigurations.html">map configurations</a> dialog 
of HWE, and to click on
"OK" afterwards. After that you're all set. Do not forget to save your maps, once 
you've enabled the "Save maps
into WAD file" option.</p>
