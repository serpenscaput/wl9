John Bucksnort


John Bucksnort made quite a mark on the Wolfenstein community in only 18
months: he was an actual World War II veteran; started modding in his early
80's; released 25 quality add-ons; contributed to two other mods; and founded
the "Spear of Destiny Fan Club" on Yahoo. He was such an energetic and unique
character that some even questioned whether he was real.


John's releases started with shareware and spear demo levels that were
variations on the originals. It wasn't until the "Tragedy at Istanbul" series
that he made an original graphical statement, and "The Schabbs Connection"
had his first original wall textures, notably the brown walls that start the
game.


"Wastelands - part one" was heavy on the Mutants, which pointed the way
to the infamous "Mutantstein" series John made with Harry Mass Senior. John
and Harry became a team known as "The Mutant Company, LTD". "Beyond Tobruk"
was the first of his add-ons to use a new EXE, originally made by B.J. Rowan
for Ken O'Brien's October 1999 "2nd.zip / On the Trail of Schabbs". John used
this EXE so often that every time I hear the "Funk You" theme, I think of him
and await a Mutant ambush.


At their pinnacle, John's mods had lots of brown colors, very loud guns,
barking and roaring guards, and relentless action. From the start, all of
his add-ons had quality levels: well-decorated, interesting and varied
environments, challenging action, and an occasional trick here and there.


A few days after the release of his last add-on, "So You Want To Be An
Assassin?", John passed away. He has been missed. The Wolfenstein community
got together to create a fitting tribute to him called "Beyond Mutantstein
Special Edition" in December 2002.


John's "Mutant Maker" legacy has been carried on by his grandson Bobby, and
in more recent times, his wife Lakota. His website <John Bucksnort Wolf 3D
Page> is now just a shell, but Harry Sr's site contains a page dedicated to
John and has most of his add-ons. It's at <John's Page>.
