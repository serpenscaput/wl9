Wes Desjardins


For a one-year period beginning in July 2002, Wes Desjardins was quite an
energetic presence in the Wolfenstein community. He usually had an ambitious
plan for an add-on in the news, and most the time we were presented with an
actual release. However, there was also a lot of vaporware, for Wes made
these announcements that never saw the light of day:

Operation: Barbarian (7/22/02)
Area 51 (08/05/02, later renamed to Area 511)
Pray for BJ (08/05/02) with Ryan de Haast
Return to Castle Rodenburg (08/30/02)
Operation: OrinTrigger (09/14/02)
The Thing: Biohazard (11/04/02) cancelled 12/01/02
Phoenix Rising (12/01/02) cancelled 02/10/03
Colonial Marines (02/10/03) with The Alien Fan
Escape From Castle Osrenberg (03/12/03)
Heretic: Return Of D'Sparil (07/14/03)
Phoenix Rising (restarted 01/02/04, later renamed to Vampire: Heinnemann)
Dusk Of The Dead (March 2004)
Way Of The Ninja (May 2004) with Wolf Skevos-Jones
Doom 2: Return Of The Dark One (08/03/04)
 

Wes has also requested the removal of some of his earlier releases:

Astrostein 2525 (07/21/02) removed 02/24/03
Shadows Of Despair (07/28/02) removed 02/24/03
Operation: MDK (08/26/02) removed 02/24/03
Operation: Aliens demo (03/12/03) removed 05/23/04
Beyond the Gates of Wolfenstein (03/17/03) removed 05/23/04


Despite all this, Wes has made several add-ons of mostly enjoyable quality.
Borrowed graphics mixed with original ones, intriguing titles, attractive
title screens, and later, unique sounds made for very interesting mods.
The level design was fairly good too, but was sometimes marred by too many
"inattentive" guards.
 

"Wolfenstein: Resurrection" is probably the best of the lot, introducing a
set of bizarre and amusing sound effects (do I hear Commander Keen in there?)
and winning a Dome Award. "Predator" has an excellent outdoor atmosphere with
animal sound effects. "METEO" actually inspired an add-on of its own, an honor
previously bestowed only upon "Chokage" and "Project Totengraeber" to that
point.
 

Wes left the community after a dispute that started when someone expressed
irritation about his many announcements and cancellations. He had a series of
Wolfenstein web sites, now gone. The <Archangel Software Cabin> is Wes'
current site, but is not Wolf-related.
