Wolfer Spotlight
AReyeP & MCS


I was a bit reluctant to write a Spotlight article pairing two wolfers, but
how can one keep the Lennon and McCartney of Wolfenstein 3-D modding apart?
Both are talented enough to make excellent TC's on their own, but working
together they have set new Wolfenstein modding standards with their sequels
to Spear of Destiny, "Spear Resurrection" and "End of Destiny".


For both of these TC's, they modified the Spear engine and came up with
an exciting blend of new features, art and gameplay that could pass as
professionally-made. Some of the features introduced in Spear Resurrection
were: a new weapon called the Multi Cannon Shredder (MCS!) with a second ammo
type, plus a "God mode" artefact and a teleporter. End of Destiny added a
stealth rifle (very useful and powerful), a rocket launcher, backpacks,
portable medkits, and my favorite, the fireball-shooting walls and their
switches. EoD also featured floor and ceiling textures, weather effects,
challenge levels, and super secret levels.


The other mods listed here are also very worthwhile, and probably better for
novices to play first. I would also suggest playing Spear of Destiny before
playing its sequels, best explained by the authors: "Although it's not
necessary, you'd be advised to play the games in sequential order to fully
appreciate the evolving storyline, as well as to appreciate the enhancements
that have been made to both graphics and the original game engine by the
Wolfenstein 3D modding community."


AReyeP's "Wolfendoom" is his best solo work, using graphics and sounds from
"DOOM", with excellent levels and a new, quite elaborate storyline. All of
his solo add-ons, other than the final "TC" version of "Wolfendoom" were
created in the early to mid 1990's. They are listed below in order of
creation, rather than release date. "CIG Wolfenstein" was released 10/02/03,
but withdrawn November 2003 due to possible legal issues.


MCS's "Wolfenstein Collection" has some nicely designed levels and Blake Stone
music. It's been fairly popular, staying within the top 25 mods in the "Die
Hard Wolfers Charts", and influential too: all 4 "Secret Mission" mods by
Joshua Waight used the Wolf Collection engine, and "Guild of Darkness I: The
Legend of Satchmo" by Tetraarchangel used its music and sound effects.
 

The game manuals, hints and storylines on AReyeP and MCS's add-ons, plus
coding tips and much more can be found at the excellent <AReyeP's Wolfenstein
3D>, which earned AReyeP an August 2002 Dome Award for its texture library.
