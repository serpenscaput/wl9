Wolfer Spotlight
Barry Christian

 
Barry Christian became publicly active as a Wolfer in the heady year of 1998:
the internet was beginning to take off, Brian Lowe started his excellent
yellow "Mr. Lowe's" web site, Activision re-released Wolfenstein 3-D, and
Chris Chokan produced the first changed EXE file for Wolfenstein, opening
up a world of new possibilities, and inspiring others such as Gary Ragland
and Barry himself.
 

Barry's sets tended to stick close to the original Wolfenstein in appearance
and atmosphere, and he emphasized the key-seeking, puzzly aspect of the game.
His designs were well-made and were packed with levels. Although overshadowed
a bit by others' flashy new graphics or source code changes, Barry's mods are
very enjoyable for those who like "old-school" mods. TSDT and Armageddon's
EXE's were hex-edited in a way similar to Assassinate Hitler and Schabbs 2000;
The Road to Neuschwanstein and Domination SE had "compiled" EXE changes, the
former featuring 4 keys.
 

Barry hosted an excellent web site, "The Wolfenstein 3D Vault", which won a
Spear of Destiny Fan Club "Spear Of Excellence Award" in July 2001. The site
was pretty popular, and featured a poll where you could vote for the best
add-on, amongst other things. The 2001 Wolfenstein 3-D Awards were based on
the Vault's poll results. After Barry "retired", Jack Ryerson maintained the
site for awhile, but today The Vault no longer exists.
