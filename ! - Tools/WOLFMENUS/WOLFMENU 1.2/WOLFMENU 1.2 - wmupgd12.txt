WolfMenu upgrade to version 1.20   6/16/00   by Andy Nonymous

New!  - Shareware v1.0 and Blake Stone registered patch swapping support 
      - Command line editing in WOLFMENU.CFG (or can leave blank, which
        defaults to enabling debug mode)
      - Edited AUDIOT files can be associated with graphics patches

The WMUPGD12.ZIP archive will upgrade your WOLFMENU setup to version 1.2
by simply unZIPping it into your WOLFMENU folder. The following files are
included:

 ADDON.SAM       06-08-00  00:28                updated sample file

 WOLFMENU.SAM    06-16-00  01:20                updated sample file             

None of your current configuration files will be overwritten, so until you
start editing your WOLFMENU.CFG as shown in WOLFMENU.SAM, your setup will
look and run exactly as before.

Enjoy!
Andy
