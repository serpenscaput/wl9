   The addons are specified in the ADDON.CFG file. The purpose of ADDON.CFG
is similar to the GRAPHICS.xxx and LEVELS.xxx files, but the format is 
different, since each of the entries can be in its own directory rather than 
all entries being in one. A sample file ADDON.SAM is included.
The format:

1-23                    25-47                   49-80
name that appears       command with switches   full directory spec

Ultimate Wolfenstein    wolf3d -goobers         C:\WOLF\ULTIMATE
Project Totengraeber    toten                   C:\WOLF\TOTEN1
Chokage                 call chokage            C:\WOLF\CHOKAGE

   NOTE: if the command is a batch file (.bat extension) you must precede
the command with call (see Chokage above). Otherwise, you will be dropped 
at a DOS prompt in the particular add-on's directory when you leave the game.

   Also, the documentation files must be named README.TXT and README2.TXT for
the browser to find them.

   BTW, you needn't limit yourself to Wolfenstein add-ons or even games. You
can run any DOS application from this part of WolfMenu.

   Like the patch config files, all entries must be valid: no blanks, remarks, 
or miscellaneous stuff in ADDON.CFG. So when you delete an entry, you must
remove it completely, not just rem it out.
