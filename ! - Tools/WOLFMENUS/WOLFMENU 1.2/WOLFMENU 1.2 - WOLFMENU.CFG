rem The first six items are the "patchable" games. If you don't want any of
rem them to show up on the menu, just rem them out. The fields are column-
rem dependent and are as follows: 1-3 are identifier letters (don't change 
rem these, please), 5-34 are full directory paths to the games, 36-69 are
rem the titles that appear on the main menu, and 71-120 are the command line
rem parameters you want to run for each game. You can change the order
rem of all of these items, and you can change the title fields too.
