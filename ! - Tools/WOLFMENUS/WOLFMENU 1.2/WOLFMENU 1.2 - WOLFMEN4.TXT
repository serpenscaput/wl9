   The WolfMenu Editor is easy and fun to use. Just select it from the main 
menu and you can change the color of the menu body, the highlight field, 
the border around the menu, and the type of border. Enter, space, or double-
click the mouse on an entry, and the new appearance comes up immediately for
your perusal.

   The settings you choose will only be saved if you select the option to
save the settings. A message will appear that the settings have been saved
in COLOR.CFG to confirm this. Otherwise, when you exit the Editor, the 
original colors (which you entered the Editor with) will be restored.

   Tip: the most conventional borders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 176, 177, 178, 219,
and maybe 255, but feel free to experiment!
