   
   To start WolfMenu, just type WOLF at the DOS prompt and hit enter.

   Within WolfMenu move the highlighted area around with the arrow keys
or a click of the mouse to where you want the highlight to move. Hitting
enter or space or double-clicking the mouse will select the highlighted 
entry. The escape key, q, or a right click of the mouse will exit any menu 
one level back. On some menus there is also a highlightable entry to return 
to the main menu or exit to DOS. 

   Entering a ? key (or / key) from a patch or add-on title will bring up 
the documentation for that item. If a second document file exists, it will 
come up after the first is exited.
 
   The F1 key brings up a quick help message to help out if you forget any
of this.

   On the patch selection menus, the space key will select without exiting
the menu, whereas the enter key or double-clicking the mouse will select and
exit to the play menu.
