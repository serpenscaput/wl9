   The mouse does not work correctly when a Windows GUI is active, i.e. either
in a DOS prompt or running WolfMenu from a desktop shortcut. This occurs in
both Windows 95 and 98. The right-click exits all the way out of WolfMenu, 
and the double-click seems to "bleed through" a bit, too.
   
   The keyboard works fine under any circumstance.
   
   So, either keep to the keyboard if you're a Windows user, or just say no
to Windows (reboot in DOS mode or use real DOS), and the mouse will work
correctly.
