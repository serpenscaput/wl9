   WolfMenu is a DOS-based, easy-to-use menu system for Wolfenstein 3-D.
Some features:

   - supports shareware and registered Wolfenstein 3-D, Spear of Destiny
     and its 2-level demo, and Blake Stone : Aliens of Gold registered.
     All patches for a game can be stored in that game's directory.

   - swaps up to 60 maps/levels and 60 graphics patches for each of the
     above games. Graphics patches can now include VGAHEAD/VGAGRAPH and
     AUDIOHED/AUDIOT files.

   - supports up to 60 standalone add-ons/TC's such as Project Totengraeber,
     Beyond Wolfenstein, Chokage, Operation: Panzerschiff, etc.

   - keeps saved games associated with their maps/levels, so they can be
     re-loaded whenever the same levels are selected.

   - browses documentation for all of your games using the DOS browser of
     your choice (I recommend Vernon Buerg's LIST, at www.buerg.com).

   - is user-configurable: add, delete, move and edit the titles that appear
     on the menus, change the menu's colors and borders.

   - allows use of both the mouse and the keyboard.

   - user can define their own command line (default is debugmode enabled).
