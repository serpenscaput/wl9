   
   WolfMenu comes with the following files:

   WOLF.BAT       <- batch file that launches the menu and starts the games
   WOLFMENU.EXE   <- executable that provides the menu interface
   MENUFLAG.WLF   <- special information file used between the above two
   COLOR.CFG      <- color and border data for WolfMenu
   WOLFMENU.CFG   <- configuration data for WolfMenu
   ADDON.CFG      <- configuration data for add-ons installed
   GRAPHICS.???   <- graphics patch data for WL1, WL6, SOD, SDM, WL0, and BS6
   LEVELS.???     <- levels patch data for WL1, WL6, SOD, SDM, WL0, and BS6

   The last four are in text format for easy editing, and a sample of each is
included with the extension .SAM.
   
   There are also various documentation files, all accessible from WolfMenu.

   The first step in setting up is editing the WOLFMENU.CFG file. Use MS-DOS
EDIT.COM or any ASCII (text) editor. The fields are column-dependent, with   
the following format:

1-3 5-34                           36-69
ext full DOS directory path        title that appears on main menu

WL1 C:\WOLF\WOLFSHR                Wolfenstein 3-D shareware 
WL6 C:\WOLF\WOLFREG                Wolfenstein 3-D registered
SOD C:\WOLF\SPEAR                  Spear of Destiny                        
SDM C:\WOLF\SPEARDMO               Spear of Destiny demo                            
   
   The order of the entries is the display order. The extension (ext) in 
columns 1-3 must match the type of game or function indicated in columns 5-34. 
36-69 are the titles that appear on the display. The directories in which the 
games reside can be anywhere on your system, so just edit this file; you don't
have to move your games or rename your directories!
  
   You can specify a DOS file browser for WolfMenu to use. I recommend
Vernon Buerg's LIST (www.buerg.com) because it can be mouse-enabled with
the /m switch and it can be color-configured with the F5-F8 keys, followed
by Alt+C to save the color settings. With the right colors, it provides a
seamless transition to and from WolfMenu.

1-3 5-34                           36-69
ext browser command                browser parameters

TXT E:\SYSTEM\LIST.COM             /M  

   If your browser is in your PATH, you don't need a full filespec, but it
might make things a *teeny* bit faster, as DOS doesn't need to search the
PATH for the command. If you still want to use it, the shorter form is:

TXT LIST                           /M                                       

   Any items you don't want can be rem'ed out so they won't display on the
menu. Like this:

rem SDM C:\WOLF\SPEARDMO 

   The remaining items are mostly text files in the WOLFMENU directory,
so they have no file spec. BAT and END are the top title on the main menu
(disabled for beta) and the exit to DOS function, respectively.
