   
   Setting up WolfMenu to your tastes and needs can be done through
the WolfMenu editor.

   For starters, change the colors and border to your liking.
Select WolfMenu Editor, then colors.  Once you have a satisfactory
combination, select the Save changes entry. A message will appear that
COLOR.CFG has been updated. If you had escaped back to the Editor menu
without saving, the colors will have reverted back to those you started with.

   Tip: the most conventional borders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 176, 177, 178, 219,
and maybe 255, but feel free to experiment! 

   All of the other items to edit work the same way: no changes will be kept
until you actively save them.
