WolfMenu version 3.2


What is this?
-------------
WolfMenu is an ongoing side-project of mine to make it easy to launch,
organize and even find my Wolfenstein 3-D add-ons and mods. Like
Wolfenstein itself, it runs in DOS (no Windows necessary). A combination
of QuickBasic executable and DOS batch files means that very little memory is
used during playing time, and the switch between QuickBasic and batch is
transparent to the user. It runs perfectly fine in various versions of DOS
and Windows 9x, and except for some of the endscreen options, runs under
Windows XP also. I have not tested this under DOSBox or VDMSound.

I've always considered it a personal project, sort of an "album" to display
my collection of Wolf mods.

Brian Lowe posted an earlier version (1.2) back in 2000 on his Yellow Site,
under Extras.


What's New?
-----------
Well, my collection has grown to over 1.3 Gigs, and Wolfenstein mods have
overwhelmingly gone from "patches" to standalone mods since I started this
project in 1999.  So, WolfMenu has developed to accommodate these changes
in my collection. Since version 1.2:

-  All changes to WolfMenu can now be done through the built-in editor (no
   more editing of external configuration files, though you can still do
   that if it pleases you).

-  Added Planet Strike patch swapping support

-  Wider field per entry, allowing for longer named mods, and additional
   information such as author and date of release

-  Much better memory management, can now support up to 600 entries per menu

-  Search / repeat search, shell to DOS prompt, home, end, refresh functions
   added

-  Many bugfixes and aesthetic enhancements

Note: if you shell to a DOS prompt, you must type "exit" to return to WolfMenu


Getting Started
---------------
After unzipping the archive into a folder (PKUNZIP users must use -d flag to
preserve the subdirectories), type SETUP to update the config files to
insert the new/current location on your machine.

From the command prompt, type WOLF to start. I have also added a "WolfMenu"
Windows shortcut for your convenience.

F1 and F2 keys for quick help / reminder of keys available to you

Sorry, no mouse support.


Setting Up
----------
Since this is strictly a DOS program, some knowledge of how to locate a
file and execute a program from within a command prompt is necessary.

Familiarize yourself with the WolfMenu Editor by changing the colors to your
liking. It's the first item under WolfMenu Editor. You can mess the colors
up as much as you want; nothing will be committed unless you select "Save
current settings" and see the message "Settings saved in COLOR.CFG" at the
top of the screen. If you don't save your changes, when you back out to the
first WolfMenu Editor screen, your original colors are restored. And if you
ever mess up by making your menus unreadable and saving, then you can
always edit COLOR.CFG with edit.com or notepad as a last resort. Just change
a number or two and then finish customizing it in WolfMenu Editor.

Once comfortable with using the editor, go to the second item called "Main
Menu", what I call the opening screen when you start WolfMenu. Here you can
add or delete a set number of specific main menu entries, move them around,
rename them, and define their location and associated executable. Note that
you cannot delete the WolfMenu Editor entry.

Under Main Menu's "Edit paths and command lines" are entries for changing
the main menu's title, and the browser used for looking at each game's readme
files and the one you are reading now (wolfmen3.txt using browse.com). I
personally like using list.com by Vernon D. Buerg, since you can change its
colors to match WolfMenu's colors. List.com is available at www.buerg.com.

Again, any changes you make will not be committed unless you select "Save
changes" and see the "Changes saved in WOLFMENU.CFG" message at the top.

For now, I will assume that you want to simply use WolfMenu for your
existing add-ons/mods that you currently play. These will be placed under
the main menu's "Other Wolfenstein games and TC's" title (which you can
change, of course). In the WolfMenu Editor they are known as "Standalone
addons".

Under "Standalone addons" you can move, delete and rename your menu entries.
These are pretty easy to use and I will not go into detail on them.

To add a new entry, enter "Standalone addons" and go to "Add entries", then
enter what you want to appear on the screen. After that, enter the full path
to your mod/TC (eg. C:\WOLF3D\EOD). Next, enter the command to run the game
(eg. spear -noss or call chokage.bat). Last, if you want to display the
endscreen text that shows after you quit the game, enter 0 for a pause, or
1-99 for number of seconds to wait before returning to WolfMenu. Leaving it
a blank skips the endscreen altogether. Win2000/XP users should use 0 or
blank because delays don't work here.

After returning to the Addon menu, select "Save changes" and you will get a
message at the top that says "Changes saved in ADDON.CFG", and you are done
with that entry (barring any typos). If you exit the editor and go to the
"Other Wolfenstein games and TC's" entry, your added TC should appear and can
be played by entering when it is selected.

Note: I have left the Wolfenstein 3-D entry in there because WolfMenu doesn't
like empty config files (zero is bad!), so you can safely delete that after
you have added your own. Or edit it to point to your copy of Wolfenstein 3-D,
using Standalone addon's "Edit paths and command lines". I have also added
some examples for your perusal. To see the pertinent information, go into
the editor under Standalone addon's "Edit paths and command lines" for each
item. Feel free to trash these items once you don't need them anymore.

Note 2: any ASCII text files in your TC's directory can be browsed if you
rename them to README.TXT, subsequent ones README2.TXT and README3.TXT.
To see them from WolfMenu, just hit the "?" key when your TC is selected.
Currently browse.com is used to look at them; as I stated before, list.com
is a bit more fancy and flexible.

That's it for "standalone" TC's/mods. In summary, all you need is

-  a location / path to your TC
-  a command to start your TC (CALL must precede any .BAT file invocations)
-  optionally, rename game docs README.TXT README2.TXT README3.TXT (limit 3)

I have included four examples of alternate ways of organizing your add-on
collection. The batch files that call them merely rename config files
and then rename them back when complete.

BEST - Wolfenstein Top 50 from the Die Hard Wolfers popularity poll

DOME - Wolfenstein Dome Award winning mods

SPOT - Wolfer Spotlight featured add-ons

FULL - A somewhat "complete" collection of TC's and patches

RESET - clean up any "out of syncs" between the 5 previous commands
        (you get wrong menu, "duplicate files" and "file not found" messages)


Patch Swappers
--------------

The original Wolfenstein "mods" were just patches, that is, changed graphics
(VSWAP) or changed levels (GAMEMAPS). The intent was to give the Wolf player
a patch to apply to his existing game to change it somehow. Streamlining this
capability was the original intent of WOLFMENU, and the "Standalone Addon"
feature was just an afterthought. Remember, this was started in 1999, and
only about a dozen or so "Standalones" existed at that time.

Start by putting a working copy of the appropriate game in its folder.

Each "patch" must have a unique filetype. For example, I've given ack's
"acktung!" levels a filetype of ACK, so the game files would be
MAPHEAD.ACK and GAMEMAPS.ACK in the WOLFREG folder. Optionally, the game
documentation has been renamed README.ACK so it can be browsed from within
WOLFMENU.

A graphics patch requires at least a VSWAP. Optionally it can have VGA files
(must include all 3), AUD files (both), and up to three README's.

In summary:

Graphics: VSWAP, [all 3 VGA files, both AUD files, README, README2, README3]
Maps: MAPHEAD, GAMEMAPS, [README, README2, README3]

The patch swapper feature allows the player to match any graphics with any
levels within a folder. Of course, they must be compatible (same version)
or the game will bomb. 

I have included several "patch swapper" folders in this package:

WOLF10 - for shareware 1.0
WOLFSHR - for shareware 1.4
WOLFREG - for registered 1.4 (see notes on VGA versions)
SPEAR - for Spear of Destiny full version
SPEARDMO - for Spear of Destiny demo
BSTONE - for Blake Stone registered
PLANET - for Planet Strike

An alternative way of patch swapping is to use the swap.bat within each of
the provided "patch swapper" folders. This allows for playing of one
new filetype only. So "acktung!" could be run from the WOLFREG folder as
"swap ACK". From WOLFMENU's "Standalone addon" section, it would have a
command line of "call swap    ACK". In other words, the command
"call swap    ABC" will take all files that ends in .ABC and use them for
playing with the version of Wolfenstein that resides in the same folder.
The "game id" is column-dependent here, and I have put in a guide in the
editing menu to help here.

The following 2 folders aren't really for WOLFMENU's patch swapper function,
but can be used for patch swapping (as described above) for those mods whose
VGA files are incompatible with the majority of registered Wolf 1.4
addons/patches (again, see the notes on VGA versions below).

WOLF11 - for registered 1.1/1.2
WOLF14 - for registered Apogee 1.4

I have set up the patch swapper folders to be under the main WolfMenu folder.
I also put all my "standalone" mod folders under here too, so all my mods
are physically in one place. This is not necessary for WolfMenu to work; you
can specify any location that is physically accessible on your computer. In
other words, if you can define where it is (drive and folder, for example
F:\GAMES\WOLF3D\MEGADEMO) and run it from DOS (executable, eg wolf3d -goobers)
you can set up WolfMenu to run it. This is done in the editor under "Edit
paths and command lines".


Notes on Registered Wolf 3-D VGA versions
-----------------------------------------

There are 3 types of distinct Wolf 3-D VGA versions which are incompatible
with each other: Apogee version 1.1/1.2, Apogee version 1.4, and the
id/GT/Activision 1.4. I have therefore set up 3 separate folders for
registered version patch-swapping: WOLF11, WOLF14, and WOLFREG, respectively.

On Flo-edited VGA files, the VGADICT file is left untouched, can tell what
version it is by the date:

Apogee version 1.1/1.2  :  6/10/92  1:10 PM
                           6/22/92  1:11 PM

Apogee version 1.4 :      12/03/92  5:39 PM
                          12/31/92 10:40 PM
                          10/01/94  1:40 PM

id/GT/Activision 1.4 :     9/02/93  8:54 PM
                           4/13/94  1:40 AM

(There is a fourth VGA group that I would call GT 1.41, but mods using it
 have always been accompanied by a changed EXE, hence its exclusion. For
 completeness sake, the VGADICT file is dated  9/13/93  1:41 PM)

On the newer editors that may re-assemble the VGADICT file, from the command
prompt, try a FC (file compare) with a known version to determine
"equivalence" (do not use the binary compare here). Even if the file sizes
differ (eg. 1024 vs 1020), the ones that result in "no differences found"
are equivalent as far as the Wolf 3D engine is concerned.


Technical notes
---------------

WOLFMENU.EXE was compiled with QuickBasic 4.50. I considered mouse support,
and had it working, but the speed of today's machines made it unstable and it
did not work as it should have. Adding delays made the mouse work better, but
ruined WolfMenu's performance. This compiler dates to 1990, and the fastest
PCs back then had a 486 33Mhz CPU.

Long file names also did not exist at that time; hence, WolfMenu needs to
use the DOS alias (aka 8.3 format). For example, in Windows, you may have:

   C:\Program Files\Games\Wolfenstein 3-D\Registered 1.4

It's an extreme example, but possible. Anyway, the DOS alias would be:

   C:\PROGRA~1\GAMES\WOLFEN~1\REGIST~1.4

(the ~1 might be ~2 or higher if there are multiple folders with the same
first 6 characters)

If you need to add that location to WolfMenu's config files, it must be in
the DOS alias form. Personally, when dealing with Wolfenstein, or any DOS
game, I avoid using more than 8 characters in the folder names.

Make sure your command line includes "call" if you invoke a .bat file, or
you will not return to WolfMenu when you complete your game. This is because
Wolfmenu creates a .bat file on the fly to actually run your game as WolfMenu
itself actually closes. If this did not happen there would not be enough
conventional memory to run your game, since WolfMenu uses almost 500k. Without
the "call", batch files simply run the referenced batch file without returning
to the original one. A useful way to exit perhaps, but not one we want to use
here.


Well, I'm out of gas, how about you?
