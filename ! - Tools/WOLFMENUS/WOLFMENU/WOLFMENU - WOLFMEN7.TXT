   Editing the main menu allows you to activate the various patch swappers
and to access the standalone addons/TC's. If these items are not activated,
they will not appear on the main menu. This is done via the add entry.
Note that after you add/activate an entry, it will appear last on the menu;
you will want to save the changes then move it to where you would like it.
And save again.

   The move and delete entries are self-explanatory. If you delete an entry,
it can always be re-activated again. The WolfMenu Editor entry cannot be
deleted, to always allow access to the Editor.

   The edit titles entry lets you change the wording of each entry on the main
menu.

   The edit paths and command lines entry is used to let WolfMenu know
where on your computer to find an item and what command to issue to launch
that item. Usually not needed unless you made an error when adding, or if
you moved something on your machine.
