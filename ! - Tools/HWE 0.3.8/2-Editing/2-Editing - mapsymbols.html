map symbols manager and select the plane whose map objects you want to edit.</p>


<p><b>Select map symbols</b></p>
<p>You can change the order of the tiles in this list. This functionality was added 
so that you can group
similar tiles together even when their map IDs are far apart. You can change the 
order by selecting the
tile you want to move and using the arrow buttons to the right of the list.</p>

<p><b>Edit map symbol information</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - The name for the map object.</li>
<li><b>Direction</b> - The direction the map object is facing.</li>
<li><b>Type</b> - The type of the map object. This list changes according to which 
plane the map object is in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also manage the map symbol types by clicking on the "<a href="mapsymboltypes.html">Manage 
map symbol types</a>"-button.</p>

<p><b>Colors</b></p>
<p>This area provides you a 16-color palette which you can use to draw a symbol for 
your map object.
You are allowed to select a primary color with the left mouse button and a secondary 
color with the right
mouse button.</p>

<p><b>Symbol</b></p>
<p>This area is used to draw a map symbol for your map object. The map symbol will 
be displayed as icon
in the tile selection list of the map editor. You can click a cell to draw it or 
you can press and hold
the mouse button while moving the mouse in order to draw lines and other shapes manually.</p>
