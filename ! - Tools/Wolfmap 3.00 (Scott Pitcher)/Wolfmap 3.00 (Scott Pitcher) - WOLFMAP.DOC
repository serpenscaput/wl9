DISCLAIMER:

	THIS  PROGRAM IS  PROVIDED AS IS  WITH NO  WARRENTY
	WHAT-SO-EVER.  IT IS UP  TO THE  USER TO  DETERMINE
	ITS FITNESS FOR USE. I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
	FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARRISE THROUGH THE USE,MISUSE,
	INABILITY TO USE, OR ABUSE OF THIS PROGRAM.



OVERVIEW:

 This program is a map maker for the Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny
games. It will create ascii maps for all four versions ...

	Wolfenstein 3D 10 level game
	Wolfenstein 3D 60 level game
	Spear of Destiny 2 level demo game
	Spear of Destiny 21 level game

Note: these level totals include all the secret levels.


CREDITS:

	Source Code 			- ME!!!
	Object & Map Codes 		- (most) Digital Aasvogel Group
					  (some) ME!!!
	Wolf6 help (data files)		- John


USE:

 To use the WOLFMAP program you must supply a valid command line,
containing map numbers, and an output file. Optional switches are
as follows ...

/WL6	...	Use this for Wolfenstein 3D 6 game/60 level version.

/SDM	...	Use this for Spear of Destiny 2 level demo version.

/SOD	...	Use this for Spear of Destiny 21 level version.

[***NOTE: if you do not use one of the above 3 switches, then the game
defaults to the Wolfenstein 3D 10 level demo version.]

/HELP	...	Supply some command line help.
/H
/?

/DIR=	...	Use this to specify the drive/directory in which the 
/D=		game is installed.

/HEXDUMP ..	Use this one to create a hex dump of the finished map.
/HD		Useful for discovering those 'unknow' codes.

/ALL	...	This one can be used instead of individual map numbers. It
/A		should work with Wolf6, but god knows how your going to
		view the humungeous text file that it will produce! HAS NOT
		BEEN TESTED WITH WOLF6.

/KEY	...	Forces (sounds kinky) the program to write a key with all
/K		the objects and map data that it knows. Prints the name,
		ascii character and hex code.

/NOWARN	...	If you don't want a list of unknown object and map data that
/W		the program finds when it dumps a map, use this. I added this
		when I had a bell '\a' character in the string that displayed
		the warning. I removed that in the end anyway!

The command line is structured as follows ...

C> WOLFMAP [switches] [game numbers] [output file]

e.g.

C> WOLFMAP /WL6 /D=\games\wolf3d 1 2 18 19 maps.txt

[**notice that to display games 2-6 you use the game number * 10
plus the map number]


NOTES ON PRINTERS & EDITORS:

 You may have trouble getting your editor to read the text files correctly.
I have used the DOS EDIT command, and the MicroEMACS editor. Both work fine.
As far as printers go, mine would not print any of the maps completely but
if you can disable the high-bit ascii codes then it should work. The
reason for this is that some of the map codes are control characters, and
I have not had the time to go and change them all (only set the high bit
for codes < 0x20). I'll mess around with this some time in the future.


SOURCE CODE:

 You can do what ever you want with the source code. If you recompile the
program though I would appreciate some credit. The program was written for
Turbo C++ 3.0, although it should compile with just about any compiler. A
make file for TC has been included. All object files and the .EXE have been
compiled using the small memory model (-ms).

I would appreciate any help with finding the unknown map and data codes. You
can contact me on FidoNet in the Australian Games conference.
