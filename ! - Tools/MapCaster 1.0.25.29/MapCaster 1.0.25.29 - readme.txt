MapCaster 1.0.25.29
==================================================
MapCaster does not currently support anything more than editing walls
and should be considered a proof of concept. It is buggy - expect it
to crash and save often. It might even crash while saving, I make no
guarantees - so don't do anything super important with it just yet.

...But if you do make something cool with it, be sure to contact me!
I'd love to hear about it.

For bug reports, contact me (Diema#6969) on Discord. Be sure to let me
know which version of MapCaster you're using and try to describe how to
replicate the problem. If it crashes with specific maps, please include
it with your bug report.

To use the editor, first, make sure you load any custom graphics first.
These can be supplied in your own pk3. Go to "File > Open pk3" to do this.
Then, load a project. "wl6.caster" is supplied for you, which should
correctly map all vanilla Wolf3D tiles, sans floorcodes.
Finally, load or start a new map.

Controls
==================================================
Up/Dn/Left/Right = Traditional movement
W/S/A/D          = Modern movement
M                = Mouselook toggle
T                = Iso view toggle
Left click       = Place tile
Mousewheel       = Zoom in/out in iso view.
                   Hold Ctrl to scroll available tiles.
F                = Free selected tile. Resets it to zero.
R                = Manually input tile ID to paint.
U                = Manually update world.
V                = Print version information.
F1               = Screenshot. Writes to %LOCALAPPDATA%/MapCaster.

Open wl6.caster in Notepad to see how to write your
own project files. In the future, these will be
editable directly in the editor.
