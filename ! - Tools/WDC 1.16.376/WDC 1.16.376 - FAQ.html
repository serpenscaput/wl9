WDC relies heavily on how you define your map data codes.
This probably means that that map code is defined as a floor instead of a wall.
<BR><BR>
To rememdy the situation:
1) Go to the "Edit" menu and select "Map Symbols."<BR>
2) Scroll until you find map code WDC mistakenly thinks is a floor.<BR>
3) Now look at the "Type". Is it defined as "Floor"?<BR>
4) If it is "Floor", set it to "Wall" or whatever it should be.
<BR><BR>
If it did not say "Floor", then there is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.

Please let me know about it.

<BR>
The Wolf3D Alpha is the only game that has a Tile16M for object code 0.
To get the objects to match the correct map codes:<BR>
1) Go to the "File"menu and select "Project Information."<BR>
2) Check the box that says "Tile16Ms start at map code 0."<BR>
3) Click "OK" and the map tiles will be reloaded.

but they look strange. Why?</B>
<BR>
For some reason I have not been able to successfully open Commander Keen 6 files.

It looks as if some Tile16Ms were stored in the EXE, but I'm not sure.
I'm still looking into this.

You need to set up an output folder in the project information screen.
This folder needs to be different from your base data folder.
Keeping things separate like this helps insure that you won't lose any data.
