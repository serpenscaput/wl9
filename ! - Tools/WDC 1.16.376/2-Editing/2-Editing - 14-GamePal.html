As of version 1.1.101, WDC can edit the GamePal.Obj file for your source.
The screen to do this is exactly the same as the normal palette edit screen except 
that you can import and export JASC Pal files.

To edit the GamePal.Obj file, go to File-&gt;Project Information.
Then click the "..." button beside the GAMEPAL.OBJ line.
Once you find the file, click the button with the opening folder to save it to a 
BMP that you can edit and import back into the GAMEPAL.OBJ.
