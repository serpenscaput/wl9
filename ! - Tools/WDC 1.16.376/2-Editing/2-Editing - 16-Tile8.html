Editing :: Tile8
</FONT><BR>
<BR>

As of version 1.6.174, WDC can edit the Tile8 chunk.
<BR><BR>

This is basically the same as editing a picture, except the picture must be 40x56 
pixels.
WDC handles the Tile8s as one chunk, so this 40x56-pixel image contains 8x8 tile8 
graphics.
<BR><BR>
As of version 1.7.185, the Tile8 chunk can be restored into your VGAGRAPH.<BR>
When you go to the Tile8 view for a VGAGRAPH that is missing this chunk, a 'Restore 
Tile8 Chunk' button will appear.
When you click it, it will ask you to export the default tile8 (stored inside of 
WDC) to a file.
This file will be automatically inserted into your project and your tile8 will be 
there the next time you compile.
