<h3>The Tile List</h3>
This list mimics the list given to you in the map editor except that you can change 
the order of the tiles.
This functionality was added in WDC 1.15.374 so that you can group similar tiles 
together even when their map codes are far apart.
You can change the order by selected the tile(s) you want to move and using the buttons 
to the right of the list or by dragging the items to the position you want.
<h3>Tile Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - The name for the map tile.</li>
<li><b>Type</b> - The type of map tile.  This list changes according to which plane 
the tile is in.</li>
<li><b>Key</b> - Represents either the key needed to open a door or the key dropped 
when a guard is killed.</li>
<li><b>Direction</b> - The direction the guard is facing at the map start or the 
turning direction.</li>
</ul>
Note that it is important that these values are set up correctly or WDC's map error 
checking will either miss errors or report errors when there are none.
<h3>Colors</h3>
This area provides you a 16-color palette which you use to paint your map tile's 
symbol.
You are allowed to select a primary color with the left mouse button and a secondary 
color with the right mouse button.
<h3>Symbol</h3>
This area is your map tile's symbol or icon that is draw in the map viewer/editor.

You can click a cell to paint it or you can press and hold the mouse button while 
moving the mouse in order to paint lines and other shapes manually.
You can also double-click a cell to replace all cells of the double-clicked cell's 
color with your selected color.
Note that this action is not the same as a flood fill.
It is also worth noting that you can make a completely black map symbol by just selecting 
a type in the tile information area.
<h3>Graphic</h3>
Use this are to set a graphic that can be displayed in the bottom-right of the map 
editor when viewing map graphics rather than map symbols.
