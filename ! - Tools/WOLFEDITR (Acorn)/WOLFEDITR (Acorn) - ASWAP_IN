Archimedes Wolfenstein-3D

ASWAP File Format Specification

(c) 1994 Powerslave Software

Written by Eddie Edwards 16/06/94

This document describes the format used by the ASWAP file in the Powerslave
Software conversion of Wolfenstein 3D.

OVERALL STRUCTURE
-----------------

The first 4096 bytes contains the directory of the rest of the file.
The next chunk of file contains the wall bitmaps
The next chunk of file contains the object bitmaps (RL-encoded)
The next chunk of file contains the samples

DIRECTORY FORMAT
----------------

The first 8 bytes contain global information:

Bytes 0/1       - Total number of items in the directory = W + O + S
                  ORd with &8000 to indicate that this is an ASWAP and not
                  a VSWAP file
Bytes 2/3       - Total number of walls = W
Bytes 4/5       - Total number of walls and objects = W + O
Byte 6          - Major format number (currently 0)
Byte 7          - Minor format number (currently 1)

Then there are (W+O+S) 4-byte numbers, each of which is a file offset of that
resource.  The last byte of a resource is always the byte before the first
byte of the next resource.  There is a final 4-byte number, which is the length
of the file (or the file offset of the next logical resource).  The rest of
the 4K chunk is reserved and should be set to all binary zeros.

The first W offsets point to wall bitmaps.
The next O offsets point to object bitmaps.
The last S offsets point to samples.

WALL BITMAPS
------------

These are 4096 bytes each, and consist of raw data (each byte represents one
pixel, with the Mode 13 palette). The bitmaps are stored column by column,
i.e. the pixels are in order (0,0),(0,1)...(0,63),(1,0)...(1,63)...(63,63).

OBJECT BITMAPS
--------------

These are run-length encoded. The actual data is in Mode 13 format, but it is
encoded as follows:

First byte - 0 = end of row
             1-127 = that number of data bytes follow
             128-255 = skip 256-that number of bytes (mask)

There are 64 rows (and 64 columns). As an example, the following row:

      ....XXXXXXXXX.....AAABBCD....

would be stored as:

252 9 X X X X X X X X X 251 7 A A A B B C D 0

Only the mask is RL-encoded, the data per scanline is raw.

SAMPLES
-------

These are in 8-bit logarithmic format, and should be played back at around
6.5KHz.
