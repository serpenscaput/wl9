General Use :
===========

The program requires the Wolfenstein directory to be located so it can access
the ASWAP file. The program has editing windows for walls, objects and samples.
Each window allows the user to flick through the current objects, which are
displayed, the samples cannot be played (yet!). Inserting new sprites/samples
could not be easier, simply drag the file to the relevant icon then save your
new ASWAP file somewhere, NOT over your original ! Then quit the editor move
your original and out your new one in place, then run !Wolf !! The ripper saves
the ripped files inside the relevant directories in the editor, the samples are
raw logarithmic.

The files that you load in should be : Sprites, Mode 13 64x64 : Samples, raw
logarithmic stamped as data files, the background to be masked on objects should
be set to black (If you have any objections to this tell me and I'll see what I
can do since it means you can't have black in the objects!!)

Possible updates : 1. Specifiable directory for ripped objects.
                   2. Loading any full ASWAP files.
                   3. Sample playing/testing.

I see no point in making this usable for floppy disk users as the ASWAP file is
split over two disks anyway. It would make file access slower and file saving
near impossible.

If you want to swap PD write to the above address, also for bugs etc.

Also any Metallica fans want to write then do so !!!
