<h1>Editing Maps</h1>
<p>The GAMEMAPS file is edited directly using the editor. When you save the GAMEMAPS file you save any
and all changes you have made. No need to worry, though. If you accidently saved the GAMEMAPS file, but you
actually didn't want to do this, a back up copy of your old GAMEMAPS file can be found in the project
folder.</p>
