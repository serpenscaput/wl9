<h1>Creating map definitions for HWE</h1>

<p><b>The copy &amp; paste way</b></p>

<p>The easiest and fastest way to create a map definition for HWE is to make a copy of an already existing
map definition structure. This little guide will teach you how to modify an existing map definition and to
make your own out of it.</p>

<p>First make a copy of the WL6 or SOD folder (and its content). Now rename the folder to the name that
your file extension has (e.g. HV1). Do the same for the INI file inside the folder.</p>

<p>That's already enough to set up a map definition for HWE.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to add or delete map objects of a plane simply change the corresponding text files or
you use the <a href="../2-Editing/mapsymbols.html">map symbols manager</a> inside of HWE. If you decide to
be hardcore and manually editing the text files, then here's the format for you: The first value is the map
object ID, the second value is the description / name of this entry, the third value is the map symbol as
hexadecimal digits, the fourth value is the map object type, the fifth value is the map object direction.
After you added your new map object(s) in the text file(s), either manually or with the map symbols
manager, it's / they're ready to be placed in HWE.</p>

<p>The recommended way to create a map definition structure with the wizard is to use an already existing
map definition structure base, and modify the values and options when necessary.</p>

<p>You can also create a map definition structure completely from scratch. This way you need to create all
map symbols by yourself.</p>

<p><b>Note: You should only modify the miscellaneous options when you're really sure you need to modify
them in order to be able to edit the maps.</b></p>
