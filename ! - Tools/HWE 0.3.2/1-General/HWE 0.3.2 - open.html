<h1>Open a project</h1>
<p>Your first step to edit maps from a Wolfenstein 3D based game is to open the project folder which
contains the maps. Select <b>File | Open Project</b> or press <b>Ctrl+O</b> or click on 
<img src="open.gif" alt="" style="line-height: 12px; vertical-align: middle"> in the main window.</p>
<p>After you clicked on one of these options, the Select Directory dialog box will appear. Here you have
to select the project folder of your Wolfenstein 3D based game.</p>
<p>If the selected maps have a file extension that doesn't exist as map definition in HWE, you'll see a
dialog which asks you if you want to create a new map definition structure for these maps. Further
information to this particular topic can be found in the tutorial
"<a href="../3-Tutorials/tut1.html">Creating map definitions for HWE</a>".</p>
