FredWolf - by Fred Kenny 

Thank you for downloading this add-on for Wolfenstein 3D. The full version of the 
game is needed to play.

This zip file contains GAMEMAPS.WL6, MAPHEAD.WL6, VSWAP.WL6 and FREDWOLF.TXT. Please 
do not distribute this set with any other files added.

This set has the same maps as on Wolffred, ie - there are 10 new levels on episode 
three, started by Fred Kenny and completed by Brian Lowe. Some later normal levels 
have bosses, usually Hans Grosse. All other episodes have some alterations done by 
Fred Kenny, particularly episode one. 

The main difference between this set and Wolffred is the new wall designs. They are 
now mainly by Fred Kenny. Several of the actors, and many of the objects, come from 
other sources and are as in Wolffred, though the colour of the Wolfkkk guard is now 
red instead of white. Credit is given to the authors of the sets mentioned.

Guards - Wolfkkk
White Guards - Eat At Joes
Mutants - Xmaswolf
SS Officers - WolfenDoom

There's lots of treasure (I MEAN LOTS).
The Machine gun is from Wolfnuck.
The chaingun is the WAND from Eat at Joe's.
The two lowest treasures are from Astrostein.
The crowns have been changed to the former 1ups.
1up's are now the ROCKETS from Wolfnuck.


Thanks go to those at id software for producing such a great game and without which 
this add-on would not be possible.
