As you lurk through the rest of the swamp, trudging through the mud and the muck, you try to stay as low as possible. A faint crack is heard from the left but you dismiss it. Must've been a toad. All of a sudden, fire opens up from four sides onto your position! The german patrol that ambushed you forced you to surrender, holing you up in a maximum security P.O.W. camp in Norway.

From what you've heard on the other side of the cell door, the Nazis are planning on constructing a huge line of long-range V2 bases along the Norwegian west coast! Sure, this mission wasn't OSS approved, but you know damn well the OSS won't stop you from killing Nazis. Get Psyched!
