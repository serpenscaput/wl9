SoD Extreme by Team RayCast (2013)
--------------------------------
New EXE for Windows based on Wolf4SDL source by Moritz "Ripper" Kroll

Wolf4SDL version 1.7 revision 262 + DHW fixes compiled for Wolfenstein 3D

Thanks for playing SoD Extreme. This is a mapset of Sod with a few minor changes 
like the fact that each level has been remade with a basically unlimited amount of 
items and guards. There have also been the addition of map names on the Get Psyched 
screen and Boss levels have been changed to timed levels rather than a points reward 
type.
