^C[Red]LOWER CASTLE

^C[DarkBlue]Great, I'm inside the castle. According to ^C[Red]Otto, ^C[DarkBlue]an ^C[Red]STG-44 ^C[DarkBlue]assault rifle and a ^C[Red]VENOM ^C[DarkBlue]machine gun are stored somewhere here. They would be very useful to me. 
So, ^C[Red]Gruber ^C[DarkBlue]is somewhere in this castle and I need to find him and kill him as soon as possible. We do not know what operation ^C[Red]"Blitz und Donner" ^C[DarkBlue]is, but based on the available information, it is better not to allow it to take place. 
Okay, let's get to work!
