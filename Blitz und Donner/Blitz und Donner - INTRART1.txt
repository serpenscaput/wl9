^C[RED]SCHLANGENSTADT OUTSKIRTS

^C[DarkBlue]So, the partisans from Kreisau took me to the outskirts of ^C[Red]Schlangenstadt ^C[DarkBlue]- then I have to go alone. It's damn cold outside, thankfully they gave me a set of winter uniforms. According to the partisans, it is easy to get lost in these hedges. 
And, apparently, there are a lot of Nazis here. My task is to finish them all off and find a way down to the underground utilities. According to the Otto, the partisans hid a STEN with a silencer somewhere here, it would be useful to me...
