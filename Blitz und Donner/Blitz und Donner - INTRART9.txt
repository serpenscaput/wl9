^C[DarkBlue]And so, by a miracle, I broke through hordes of hellish creatures and ectoplasmic entities that were extremely unfriendly. In the elevator, I suddenly caught a signal from ^C[Red]Otto, ^C[DarkBlue]our contact in the village. 
^C[Red]Gruber's ^C[DarkBlue]here somewhere. The kreisau fighters are waiting for me in the sewers near the northern exit of the castle. They have a huge amount of plastid with them. 
Now I'm going to finish off the remaining krauts, tear off ^C[Red]Gruber's ^C[DarkBlue]head, and then we'll bury this damned castle along with all the occult horrors by mining its foundation.
