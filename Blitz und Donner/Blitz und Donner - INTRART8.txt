^C[Red]CURSED CASTLE

^C[DarkBlue]Now I'm sure I'm too late. The air smells of sulfur and burning flesh. This smell is not to be confused. I have already heard this smell and every time it was accompanied by devilry. I hear devilish screams. 
Obviously, ^C[Red]Gruber ^C[DarkBlue]performed the ritual. I do not know if I can stop this nightmare, but I will try. The Nazis blocked all the doors, barricaded themselves somewhere here and hid the key behind an electric field. 
I have to find a way to open the passage and get to ^C[Red]Gruber.
