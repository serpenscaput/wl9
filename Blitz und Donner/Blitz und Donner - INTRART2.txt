^C[Red]OLD TUNNELS

^C[DarkBlue]Finding an elevator leading to these tunnels was quite a task. Apparently, the Nazis use this place to secretly move goods in and out of the castle. Also, through these tunnels, they escort abducted civilians and captured partisans to the castle - ^C[Red]Gruber ^C[DarkBlue]personally ordered everyone to be taken to the castle. According to the rumors, terrible things are being done to them there... I have to get to the lower level of the castle and look for ^C[Red]Gruber.
