^C[Red]CENTRAL COMMAND

^C[DarkBlue]Damn... The Nazis really seem to have gone off the rails. ^C[Red]Gruber ^C[DarkBlue]is nowhere to be found, but I found traces of his stay here - a lot of bloody massacres and traces of dark rituals. The madman is sacrificing his own soldiers, since the civilians, apparently, have run out. 
I hear strange noises in the corridors of the castle. I'm afraid it's bad. Anyway, I have to move on.
