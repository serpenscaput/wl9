                " The Formula"



Here is part 2...There are 12 levels of carnage here,
 along with all your favorite Bosses. Beware of Quarkblitz's
Ubermutants, for they could be lurking on any of the floors..
level 10 is by Brian Lowe from an old set of mine, with some cool changes...
Also, one of my favorite maps from the "Lost episodes" is used as well...
Level 9 is by "DA Muncher"(Harry Sr.). Watch for the spear, You will see it a lot..

  I owe Harry a depth of gratitude for his help in finishing the set, for I havn't 

Been feeling well as of late...Thanks a lot, old friend...

So..Enjoy the set and part 3 will be out right behind it!!
(If you survive this one)  Remember, I hide keys in the strangest places....
