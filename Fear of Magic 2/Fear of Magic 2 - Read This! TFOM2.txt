THE FEAR OF MAGIC ][
--------------------

It seemed that my idea about this type of theme, was cool and exciting, so, I maked this, the second version of TFOM. Nearly all gfx are new, and some, small code changes.

Plz, don't just play one level to see how the TC is, try to make to the goal, and play all levels..

What is new in THIS version of "The Fear of Magic"?

* New story
* 15 large, well designed levels!
* New Images, like in the status bar.
* New sounds!
* New wall images, and sprites;  1 New guard, 1 Boss.

<STORY>



(This is the full story, better than the one in the about screen.)

From the king of Aklaz (The land of the adventure.)

As we know; Warlock Wizardi used his magic to control the dead people, and bring them back to life! Hi had now a giant army of bones and blood that would do anythin he tells them to do, with them, he could take over the world in a few months!!

This adventure begins were you ended in the last adventure. You stand in the blod of Wizardi as you must find a way back out of his castle.
The world is still in terror, from the real neclace that Wizardi's father owns. So you must find his father, kill him and find the real necklace and destroy it so the power of the monsters can disappear!

Good Luck, my mighty magician.
