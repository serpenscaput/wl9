To play, double click on the JOELSDL application in folder...
You can use Command Prompt to manually run the game if you wanna play with a custom
resolution, windowed mode or anything...
"cd\wherever you unzip your games\"
"then type joelsdl.exe --res 1600 1000 (or whatever 320x200 resolution you want)


NOTE: As a demo, NOT everything here is final. I intend on making some of the enemies
(slightly) more detailed, MORE enemies are presently in the works, more maps/graphics/etc.
Some graphics are mere placeholders for now...

And if I could get coding working again, that'd really be wiz. (Drinks Soykaf)...

Shadowrun references... Don't ask... lol
