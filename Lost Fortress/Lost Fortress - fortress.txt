                        THE LOST FORTRESS (SOD_21)
                            Spear of Destiny

     The Lost Fortress is a set I designed as a sequel to WLF3D_60. 
It is a competely unique and redesigned set of levels of Spear of Destiny.
I have used some of my better portions of WOLF3D_60 in it.  Most levels
are completely unique.


STORY
	You have been assigned on a mission to capture the Spear of Destiny
out of the forbidden fortress behind Castle Hollehammer.  Nobody has ever
entered this fortress because when they open the door, they mysteriosly
electricuted.  How could a fortress that dates back to prehistoric times
have electricity? The Spear is the answer.
	You are on a mission that nobody except Hitler himself has done.
You will have to travel to the Neverending Tunnel within the heart of Castle
Hollehammer to reach tho fortress.  The only way to make it through the gates
of the Fortress, is to travel through the neverending tunnel.  Good Luck!
