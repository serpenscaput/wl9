I ended this very hard. Bored with wolf, hated this game, just want it out before 
I throw it to the recycle bin!

It's like "Secrets of Offenbach"...ended in a way that I din't want to, but at least 
I'm satisfied with these maps. 

I included MAP- and OBJDATA just in case.

You've got to choose your own ceiling colour and music by pressing TAB+Z, enter three 
numbers, and TAB+Y and inset a number between 0 and 26. There's more codes in the 
EXE. Try it out yourself.

Run thomas.bat to play the game.
