<IDEA>

Instead, of being the _usual_ wolf 3d addons that has to do with WWII, this is a 
Heretic/Hexen type of a game! You are in the old middle ages, as you fight your way 
forward, and being attacked by skelletons, wolfes warlocks, and zombies...!

Use yor weapons; the knife, the fire magic, the light magic, and the wizard wand!
