The exe was made by RonWolf and has the following coordinates for map-defined stuff:


X Y
[0][0]: Song
[1][0]: Ceiling color
[2][0]: Floor color
[3][0]: First Aid Kit value (if you want the first aid kit to give you 25 health 
you place wall tile 25 in that mapspot.)
[4][0]: Food Plate value
[5][0]: Dog food value
[6][0]: Gibs value
[7][0]: Ammo value
[8][0]: Used ammo value
[62][0]: Par time (minutes)
[63][0]: Par time (seconds, 0 = 0, 1 = 15, 2 = 30, 3 = 45)

Other coding features:

*Ingame messages have been added, which can be turned off with the M-button. The 
MLI cheat code has been changed.

*Consecutive seamless levels.

*The deathcams have been removed and all bosses drop a gold key.

*You can now use 200 actors and 500 static objects in your map.
